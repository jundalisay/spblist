Pre-Existence sits above Existence which is under the 3 Influences . As this domain is above Existence, it does not exist. Rather it is entirely probabilistic or theoretical. In Material Superphysics, this  leads to the ‘Probability Layer’.

This Pre-Existence is a concept created to explain how Existence is generated arbitrarily or probabilistically by desire. This is why the control of desire is:
- one of the central tenets of Hinduism and Buddhism, and
- an important part of Islam which is imposed through fasting, charity, and modesty.

We create the Concept of Pre-Existence in order to stop the mind from wasting its energy thinking of infinities. This happens because the mind lazily connects related ideas automatically.  

For example, a person might ask: “What came before the Big Bang? What happened before that? What is beyond the universe?”

For these, the concept of Pre-Existence absorbs all such queries so that the person can change his mental direction and do more useful things with his mind.
