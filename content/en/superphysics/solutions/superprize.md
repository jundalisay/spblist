### The Problem with the Nobel Prize 

The Nobel Prize is given by a Western body to promote Western culture. This is still a relic of the colonial times and does not represent all of humanity. 

We propose a Super Prize that actually embraces all cultures, whether:
- democratic or dictatorial
- Western or Asian
- ancient or modern 

Unlike the Nobel Prize that gives money, the Superprize will give resources from the moneyless economic system created by Supereconomics.

This prize is modelled after the prize from the Select Society which encouraged innovations in Scotland.
