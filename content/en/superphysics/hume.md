David Hume's philosophy is based on impressions and ideas, with impressions being the cause of ideas.

Like Descartes, he goes with the process of `senses --> impression --> reflection --> ideas (desires, perception) --> soul`

<!-- memory = repeat impressions strong, restrained, focuses on order and position
imagination = faint, unrestrained
uniting principle among ideas (gentle force, language): resemblance, contiquity, cause effect
two objeccts third object. new objects weaken links.  -->

<!-- To him Only existence and nonexistence are really contradictory -->

Complex ideas are made up of relations of ideas which have 7 kinds:

 <!-- modes substances -->

1. Resemblance
2. Identity
3. Space Time
4. Quantity
5. Degree of Quality, Comparative
6. Contrarity, Difference (Difference of number or kind)
7. Cause Effect
