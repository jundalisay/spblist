The Supreme Entity begins the existence of something by having an idea of it. The desire for it then pushes it down the 5 Layers onto physical domain, as a physicalized version through the Negative Force.

This physicalized version is then experienced by consciousness through the Positive Force. 

This closes the loop between Experiencer and Experience and justifies Existence.

Thus:
- The Negative Force separates and creates ignorance
- The Positive Force unites and creates knowledge


{{< q a="Lao-tzu" c="Part 6, The Tao Te Ching Simplified" >}} 
The Great passes on in constant flow. Passing on, it becomes remote.  Having become remote, it returns.

The physicalized versions of metaphysical ideas are the physical expression of those ideas. <!-- Since ideas and feelings exist before their physical counterparts, we can say that the latter are expressions of such ideas.  --> For example, a tasty dish is an expression or manifestation of the idea of tastiness. 
- The cook had a metaphysical idea for a tasty dish and so he created a tasty dish in reality.
- This tastiness is proven after he tastes it and is experiened by his mind.
- This **closes the loop** from his mind creating an idea of a tasty dish to his mind actually experiencing a tasty dish.
- The match of idea and experience then forms his truth: "Yum! It really, truthfully was a tasty dish."

In the same way, the universe exists because the Creator had an idea to create it. Our experiences of the universe is part of the loop-closings that verify or give truth to Creator's ideas. This loop began with the creation of the universe and is closed with our experiences of it. 

The Creator might have had an idea of a car. So It creates a Big Bang, then planets, then minerals, then humans, then inventors, then  manufacturers to finally have a physical car to be validated by a conscious being such as a human to close the loop. 

<!-- Everything that we perceive in the universe therefore is an expression of the latent ideas of the Creator that It makes from Itself. 

The Creator had an idea of tastiness among Its infinite ideas. So It created the universe, via a 'Big Bang' to create stars that created matter that led to life that led to humans who could cook a delicious dish which was completed when it was actually tasted by someone who validated the idea by saying "Yum!". 
 -->

The timespan from the Big Bang to the actual riding of the car might take billions of years from our perspective. But since time is a product of the Creator, then It is not bound by that time. To It, the closing of the loop from the idea of the car to the experience of the car is instantaneous.  




### Desire and Alignment are the keys

In our novel analogy, the novel came to life when the reader's mind started browsing the pages. The act of reading comes from the desire to read. 

Desire is a kind of feeling which itself is a wave. Thus, desire is important in navigating reality and in making the story that you want.


{{< img src="/graphics/psych/horse.jpg" cap="Nature, as the physical aspect of the Supreme, keeps on putting desire objects for the ego to chase" alt="horse" >}}

In business and entrepreneurship, this desire is called *grit*. Successful businessman are known to have more grit than non-successful ones. 

<!-- Investors invest in entrepreneurs that have the most grit. Superphysics can help the businessman, or any human that has a goal, to experience his goal by explaining the metaphysics of grit and desire.  -->

Back in our novel analogy, the reader might have a strong desire to read. But he can only read what the Novelist has written down. 

Therefore, merely having strong desires in not enough to create a good reality. **What's more important is to align those desires to the desires of the Novelist.** The Hindus call this alignment as Dharma. This dharma comes from The Law of Conservation of Idea explained in Chapter 3 and is notated as `G` in Chapter 4c. 

This alignment is done by the reader by choosing the right cat-novel to read. The proper alignment does not come instantly but happens through instances of trial and error. The more instances, the better. We call this as *learning experiences*.  

The quality of learning experiences would be higher if the scope of learning were expanded. A reader can find a better cat-novel if he searched at a bigger library or bookstore. Superphysics expands the library of science by adding to it the library of metapyhsics.

<!-- The next chapter will deal with the attraction and repulsion that is created by the Two Forces, as our Elastic Theory of Gravity.  -->

<!-- Nowadays, the advancement science has led to economic growth, but has also opened up new problems:

- Global warming
  - Disasters like floods, mass extinction
  - Seasons being hotter or cooler than normal
- Covid (The reduced cost of air travel allowed Covid to spread quickly)
- Poverty and Inequality 
- Political instability 
  - Terrorism (since 9/11, terrorists have used airplane technology)
  - Migrant crises

There is clearly a desire to solve them. But no solution has been found because the learning experiences have been confined away from metaphysics.  


## Let's Solve Problems Inside the Matrix

Superphysics uses the blending of science (particles) and metaphysics (waves) to find the solutions and implement them faster than ordinary science or philosophy. This will help create a *dharmic* reality that is in line with the Metaphysics of Things inside the Matrix of Existence. 

Since prevention is better than cure, then AI will be the key to discover the patterns of feelings to make sure we stick to the dharma and avoid giving problems to ourselves.

The concept of a metaphysical domain allows us to explain the properties of metaphysical ideas. This then leads to our Law of Conservation of Idea, which is the base for the Law of Conservation of Matter and Energy.
