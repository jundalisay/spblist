### All Things Can Perceive, But Some Might Not Be Able To Express

The dynamics of the 2 forces implies that everything is conscious, having the ability to perceive. It is the inability of some identities to express those perceptions, due to the influence of the Negative Force, that makes things not seem to have any perception-ability (not be aware). But the fact that they can react to actions done onto them is proof that they are aware or can perceive.

For example, ice thaws when heated. This reaction is proof that the ice atoms were able to perceive the heat and reacted accordingly. There is nothing that does not react to actions done on it. This is proof that the universe is aware and conscious even if their reactive potential is very limited.

The perception-ability or consciousness in a piece of paper is proven when it:
- falls to the ground (reacts to gravity)
- is lifted by the air (reacts to aerodynamics)
- burns from a flame (reacts to thermodynamics)
- is cut by scissors (reacts to contact forces)
- and so on

A piece of paper that does not react to gravity, air, scissors, fire, etc has no perception-ability. But such a paper has never been observed and therefore does not exist. This removes any mystical connotation on what consciousness or the perceiver is. Instead, the mystery is with:
- the nature of the mind that houses it, and
- what its perceptions are (i.e. how does a piece of paper feel about being cut, burned, or written on?)
