The 8 densities are based on the ratio of the 5 Layers to each other as they impose on Existence-Consciousness through the Negative Force. 

More simply, it is the difference between pure staticity or limitation and pure dynamism or freedom.

Domain | Density | Name | Manifestation
--- | --- | --- | ---
Physical | 1 | Identity | Pure Staticity, perceives as objects
Physical | 2 | Self | Perceives from a single point
Physical | 3 | Collective | Perceives as a group
Quasi-Physical | 4 | Lower Mind | In between physical and metaphysical perceptions
Metaphysical | 5 | Higher Mind | Start of pure metaphysical domain
Metaphysical | 6 | Soul | Universes in the Multiverse
Metaphysical |  7 | Brahma or Oversoul  | Ultimate Cause
Void |  8 | Non-Existential | Void



Currently, humans are on the early stages of the 4 th density. We have knowledge of abstract philosophy which proves a belief in the metaphysical domain. 

Yet there is no consensus of what the “physics” of the metaphysical domain is. 

This is what Superphysics aims to provide in order to help advance the human species to the upper densities and dimensions.

Of these 8 dimensions and densities, 7 matches the 7 chakras in yoga since the 8th dimension is only theoretical. 

Physically, the dimensions will be useful in Material Superphysics.

Metaphysically, the densities will be useful in Bio-Superphysics which deals with life and the chakras.

For example, after death a person’s soul might be subtle enough to move on to the metaphysical domain into the 5th and 6th densities as a spiritual or luminous entity. 

Usually, a soul’s advancement is not so rapid and so it might go back into the physical domain as 4 th
density.

More importantly, these dimensions and densities give the soul a direction in life – to aim for the subtler and higher realms instead of wasting time trapped in the lower densities. This goal is called the state of samadhi:

{{< q a="Buddha" c="Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sutta" >}}
’Where does this Buddha come from and where am I going? As I think of this Buddha, He comes from nowhere and I am going nowhere. As I think of the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm*, these three realms are formed by my mind. I can see what I think of. The mind forms a Buddha for itself to see; the mind is the Buddha mind. As my mind forms a Buddha, my mind is the Buddha; my mind is the Tathāgata; my mind is my body.’ 

Although the mind sees a Buddha, the mind neither knows itself nor sees itself. The mind with perceptions is saṁsāra; the mind without perceptions is nirvāṇa. Dharmas as perceived are not
something pleasurable. They are empty thoughts,
nothing real. This is what Bodhisattvas see as they abide
in this samādhi.

form realm is in the physical domain. Desire makes up the 2 Forces which
will be explained in Chapter 3. -->
