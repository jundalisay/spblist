Reality is an effect of perception. 

Perception is a disturbance in a line in the aether or akasha, which is the substance for existence. This is because existence exists as a thought-projection of the Supreme Mind as the Brahman. 

The resulting existence is called Brahma. 

For those who are allergic to religion and think that Brahma is a religious word, we can use the layman term **Totality of Existence**, or Existence with a capital 'e', instead. 

The disturbances in the Supreme Mind manifests as waves. 

These disturbances are caused by the interaction of the 2 Forces of Positive and Negative, called Yang and Yin in Taoism, and Shiva and Shakti in Hinduism. Again, for those who are allergic to religion, we use Positive and Negative instead. 

These waves create Existence.

{{< i s="/graphics/super/reality.jpg" a="Waves" c="Before reality is deployed, existence is perfect without any disurbances nor any variety" >}}

These disturbances creates pockets of void in Existence. These have to be filled for Existence to have no holes or 'bugs' or errors. These are filled by thinner and subtler waves. 


{{< q a="Descartes" c="Dioptrique" >}}
Almost all philosophers admit that there is no void in nature. 

All the bodies which we perceive around us have several pores which are necessarily filled with some very subtle and very fluid matter, which I call the 1st Element. This matter extends without interruption from the stars to us.
{{< /q >}}


The phrase "there is no void in Nature" means that God is everywhere and that God is everything. 

For those who are allergic to religion, we can say instead that the aether or 5th Element fills everything. This is consistent with quantum mechanics that says that empty space is not truly empty. 

- The crude waves collectively are part of the physical domain.
- The subtle waves collectively are part of the metaphysical domain.

This aether is called substance by 17th century natural philosophy and ancient Greek philosophy. 

{{< q a="Descartes" c="The Description of the Human Body" >}}
We see that our soul is a substance distinct from body. We know our soul solely from the fact that it thinks.
{{< /q >}}

{{< q a="Descartes" c="Meditations on First Philosophy" >}}
These external ideas and causes are made of substance. A substance is a thing capable of existing independently.

For example, I think that a stone is a substance, and that I am a substance.
{{< /q >}}


{{< q a="Spinoza" c="The Principles of Cartesian Philosophy, Part 1" >}}
"Substance" is everything in which there is something that we perceive as immediately inhering in a subject, or through which there exists something that we perceive (i.e., some property, quality or attribute whose real idea is in us).

Substance is a thing in which there exists formally that something which we perceive (i.e., that something which is objectively in one of our ideas).

Mind is substance in which thought immediately inheres.
{{< /q >}}


## The Superiority of the Metaphysical over the Physical

The subtle waves wrap around and penetrate the cruder waves in order to fill the void. This is why the subtle metaphysical domain is superior to the physical. 

In some places in the aether, there arises a concentration of waves, as nodes. 
- The cruder nodes become ideas. 
- The subtler nodes become minds. 

Perception occurs when these nodes of minds interact with each other and with other ideas. 

<!-- A perceiving mind within that Supreme Mind is also a disturbance, as a node, that encounters other disturbances.  -->

{{< i s="/graphics/super/waves.jpg" a="Waves and Nodes" >}}

In Cartesian Physics, these are called vortices instead of nodes. 

{{< q a="Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia, Part 3" >}}
The Earth and the other planets are carried along by a common vortex, with the Sun at its center and move in the motion of the vortex.
{{< /q >}}

The stars and planets are therefore concentrations of crude and subtle waves. 


A richer perception therefore is made up of multiple waves of disturbance hitting a disturbance that is also more complex than others. 

Having no perception is perceiving no disturbance and therefore no mind. 

Emtpy space has no nodes or few disturbances, while a rich galaxy has a lot of them. 



## Causal, Subtle, Crude within Physical and Metaphysical

The 2 domains are static divisions of reality, based on immediate perception as physical or metaphysical.

But waves are never static. 

To have a basis for the actual phenomena that is sequential or made up of successive perceptions, we create the 3 operational divisions of reality as:

1. Causal
2. Subtle
3. Crude


{{< i s="/graphics/meta/divisions.jpg" a="3 Operational Divisions" c="">}}


{{< q a="Ibn-Khaldun" >}}
The ability to think has several degrees.
1. The first degree.. mostly consists of perceptions. 
2. The experimental intellect
3. The speculative intellect 
{{< /q >}}


This is similar to the Freudian:

- Unconscious
- Subconscious
- Conscious

However, our difference is that the basis for the divisions are not awareness, but the properties of the 2 Forces of Positive and Negative. 
- This is the same basis of the 2 domains. 

The interaction of different phenomena take place in 3 divisions based on their affinity with either the Positive or Negative Forces.


### Basis for the Groupings of Phenomena

These divisions are the basis for different groups of phenomena:

Division | Phenomena 
--- | --- 
Causal | Abstract
Subtle | Living
Crude | Non-Living 

Each of these divisions have its own subdivisions made up of 5 parts.

Division | Subdivision 
--- | --- 
Causal | 5 Strata
Subtle | 5 Elements
Crude | 5 Layers 

- The 5 parts of the causal subdivision is called the 5 Strata
- The 5 parts of the subtle subdivision is called the 5 Elements, with reference to the Asian 5 Elements
- The 5 parts of the crude subdivision is called the 5 Layers


{{< i s="/graphics/meta/layerstrata.jpg" a="3 Operational Divisions" c="">}}


These phenomena and subdivisions will be studied by the different branches of Superphysics.


Subdivision |  Phenomena | Superphysics Branch 
--- | --- | ---
5 Strata | Abstract | Social and Spiritual 
5 Elements | Living | Bio
5 Layers | Non-Living | Material
