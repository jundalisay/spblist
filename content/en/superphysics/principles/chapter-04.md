There are 2 Domains in Reality | The Metaphysical is Superior to the Physical
. | The Objects in the Metaphysical Domain are called Ideas

Chapter 3 explained that the downward flow of ideas from imagination into reality is facilitated by the Negative Force. 

This is matched by the upward climb of understanding from the Positive.

In other words, a thing can travel from idea downwards to matter, just as matter can travel upwards to idea.

For instance, we sometimes perceive something totally new. When Covid first struck in December 2019 in Wuhan, doctors had no metaphysical idea of it, even if they could see the physical disease.

{{< img src="/photos/med/covid.jpg" alt="Covid in water" cap="The idea of Covid is started to exist in the physical domain when the physical perception of the new virus began. Its evolution from 'Novel Coronavirus Disease' to 'Covid-19' is an example a metaphysical 'aether drag'" >}}

In this case, the physical disease started to exist through the senses of the Wuhan doctors. But the complete idea of it did not exist in human minds until scientists established it as a new idea called Novel Coronavirus Disease, later renamed as Covid-19.

<!-- It means that the complete metaphysical idea existed in Nature, before humans could completely recreate it in their minds. -->

A materialist will say that this example is proof that ideas are created by material perceptions. 

We reply that the physicality of Covid came from the Supreme’s idea for Covid, and that our idea for Covid is a closing of that great loop from Consciouness to Existence and back to consciousness. 

The continuation of this loop includes the evolution of its idea from ‘Novel Coronavirus Disease’ to ‘Covid-19’ as an example of metaphysical ‘aether drag’ which will be in Material Superphysics.



<!-- In this case, the physical disease started to exist through the senses of the Wuhan doctors. But the complete idea of it did not exist in human minds until scientists established it as a new idea called Novel Coronavirus Disease, later renamed as Covid-19.  -->


## The Superiority of the Metaphysical Over the Physical

This strengthens the fact that:
- physical things are perceivable through our 5 senses
- metaphysical things are perceivable through our intellect and feelings (the 6th sense).
- every physical thing or perception has a corresponding metaphysical idea or feeling
- every idea or feeling exists before its physical version does.

<!-- - physical things are tangible and perceivable through our five senses

{{< img src="/photos/objects/mugecon.jpg" alt="Mug Economics" >}}

The mug only existed after the maker of mugs had the idea of a mug, as to be able to create a physical mug. 

It follows that Covid-19 existed after Nature had the idea for it, and that its solution already exists in Nature*.

*This is why our proposed solution to end Covid is to end the war against the Amazon rainforest, just as the Spanish flu ended after the peace of World War I. Vaccines are just a workaround that is supposed to buy time to implement that real solution. Unfortunately, science thinks that vaccines are the solution. The error in this is proven by the rise in the recent Covid hospitalizations in Europe despite their high vaccination rates. Superphysics is pro-vaccination just like we are ok with paracetamol for headaches. But both are just workarounds to buy time to find the root cause of the virus and the headache.

Thus:
- every physical thing or perception has a corresponding metaphysical idea or feeling
- every idea or feeling exists before its physical version does.

For example, before a novel about a cat is written in a physical form, the idea for the novel must exist first. 

Therefore, the metaphysical aethereal idea is superior and prior to its physical material form.  
- The material form is easy and obvious.
- The aethereal idea is abstract and hard to grasp.  

**To dull and unthinking minds, this makes the material version of the idea as seemingly superior, even if it is actually just the effect.**

The dull-minded people and the sharp-minded ones then argue on **which came first**, and **which is superior**. 

Did the physical version come first? Or did the aethereal or idea-version come first?

- The pro-metaphysical camp would say that ideas, spirit, and Plato's forms came first. This is the chicken.
  - An example is the Hindu belief that the universe was created from the thought of Brahma 
- The pro-physicality camp would say that matter, material evidence, and Aristotle's material substance came first. This is the egg
  - An example is the Big Bang, wherein the universe came from a material singularity that had all the mass of the universe. 

The aetherealist-materialist rivalry exists in civilized cultures:

Culture | Aetherealist | Materialist
--- | --- | ---
India | Vedanta, Buddhism |  Kali (idol-worship), Carvaka
China | Taoism | Confucianism
Islam | Sufism | Sunni policies such as Sharia (e.g. the Quran has geocentric physics inherited from Aristotle)
Europe | Religion, Philosophy | Science


<!--   - In Hindu philosophy, this manifests as sects of Shaivism and 
  - In Chinese philosophy, this manifests as , saving face, and showing how prosperous you are as a physical proof of your happiness
  - In Islamic philosophy, this manifests as the    -->


In the West, the rivalry manifests as philosophy versus science. 

_ | Philosophy | Science
--- | --- | --- 
Emphasis | Spirit and ideas | Sensory proofs and material evidence
Consciousness is.. | ..the metaphysical soul | ..the physical brain

Superphysics is in between both abstract philosophy and material science.
- It is grounded on the metaphysical, but can quickly extend down to sensory evidence and practicality. 
- It sees the physical brain and its hormones as the effect of the metaphysical soul and its feelings. 

Unlike science which manipulates the brain and hopes that it changes the soul or mind, Superphysics works directly on the soul in order to resolve its physical issues with the brain.
