The 2 domains are static divisions of reality, based on immediate perception.

For example, you can see your mug with your eyes. But you cannot see the idea of that mug in your mind with your eyes. There is no cloud that pops up on top of your head where you can see how that mug is recreated in your mind.

To have a basis for the actual phenomena that is sequential or made up of  successive perceptions, we create the 3 operational divisions of reality as:

1. Causal
2. Subtle
3. Crude

{{< q a="Ibn-Khaldun" >}}
The ability to think has several degrees.
1. The first degree.. mostly consists of perceptions. 
2. The experimental intellect
3. The speculative intellect

This is similar to the Freudian:

- Unconscious
- Subconscious
- Conscious

However, our difference is that the basis for the divisions are not awareness, but the properties of the 2 Forces of Positive and Negative. 
- This is the same basis of the 2 domains. 

The interaction of different phenomena take place in 3 divisions based on their affinity with either the Positive or Negative Forces.


### Basis for the Groupings of Phenomena

These divisions are the basis for different groups of phenomena:

Division | Phenomena 
--- | --- 
Causal | Abstract
Subtle | Living
Crude | Non-Living 

Each of these divisions have its own subdivisions made up of 5 parts.

Division | Subdivision 
--- | --- 
Causal | 5 Strata
Subtle | 5 Elements
Crude | 5 Layers 

- The 5 parts of the causal subdivision is called the 5 Strata
- The 5 parts of the subtle subdivision is called the 5 Elements, with reference to the Asian 5 Elements
- The 5 parts of the crude subdivision is called the 5 Layers

These phenomena and subdivisions will be studied by the different branhces of Superphysics.


Subdivision |  Phenomena | Superphysics Branch 
--- | --- | ---
5 Strata | Abstract | Social and Spiritual 
5 Elements | Living | Bio
5 Layers | Non-Living | Material
