The previous chapter explained the nature of the Absolute Entity, as Pre-Existence, as a theoretical concept to come before Existence.

We say that the Absolute left the nothingness of Pre-Existence by becoming or transforming into Existence Itself  It is this transformation that generated the aether and all the possible ideas from Itself. 

Spinoza calls this aether as “substance”:

{{< q a="Spinoza" >}}
God, or substance, consisting of infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality,
necessarily exists.
{{< /q >}}


{{< q a="Parmenides" >}}
Since the One exists, then the Whole has the One and Existence as Its parts. Each of these parts have both the
One and Existence as its parts and is at the least made up of two parts. The same principle goes on forever.

Every part always has these two parts because existence always involves one, and one involves being, so that one is always disappearing, and becoming two. This makes the One infinite in multiplicity. The One has Existence and therefore exists, leading it to become many.”
{{< /q >}}


The creation of Existence necessarily creates the Consciousness to perceive those ideas so that Existence and Consciousness are really 2 sides of the same coin.

By using the particle physics of Descartes and Spinoza, we can make an analogy of:
- consciousness being a hole
- existence being the things that go through the hole  

{{< youtube lISLgasNjHk >}}



This Existence-Consciousness, as a unit, does not have a start or end because the Spatial Layer, and therefore space and time, has not been created yet. 

And so we say that Existence-Consciousness always was, is, and will be* and therefore, there was never any actual transformation event.

{{< f f="There are some theoretical physicists who imagine that the universe will get destroyed through a thermal death or through false vacuum decay into a true vacuum. We assert that such things are impossible based on our principles of the 5 Layers and 2 Forces." >}}


In our Big Bootup analogy in Chapter 2, this means that reality was always “turned on”, since:
- Existence is the “on” state
- Pre-Existence is the “off” state

Whenever we say “existence”, we automatically infer a consciousness behind the scenes to perceive that existence. 

Yet we usually take such consciousness for granted because our consciousness is so common to us. Similarly, space and time were seen as separate because our location is more obvious and common to us than time (i.e we usually wear watches to remind us of the time instead of carrying maps or GPS devices to remind us where we are). 

This was until experiments showed that space and time were one entity.
