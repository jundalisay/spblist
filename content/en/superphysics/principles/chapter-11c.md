### The Socratic Dialogue as Relationality Implemented

Cartesian Relationality is a key concept in Superphysics which focuses on the relation or relativity between 2 identities. 

This relation is the effect of the differences or similarities between the gravitational signature or dharma of 2 identities. 

Identities interact with each other because they have some wave in common. For example, in our physical reality, every single thing that we experience has some physicality coded in one of its many waves, since every identity is a compound idea. 

This means there are other perceptions that we cannot have because they do not have physicality in their waves. 

The fact that things come into our perception means that they have some thing in common with us and our own bunch of waves. 

We know how such things are related to us by observing them. We call this passively getting the waves from that identity. 

The problem is that some waves are deep and need effort to be revealed. Ths is where probing comes into the picture.

We probe:
- a rock by tapping it with a metal rod
- a body of water by dipping our feet in
- a fruit by pressing it with our fingers

These probing actions inject contact between us with the other identity or object. 

This contact then creates a feedback to our own minds that creates am aethereal relation between us and the identity. 

For physical things, we use physical objects like a metal rod, our feet and fingers. 

For metaphysical things such as souls, we use our own souls. For example, we talk to a person to get feedback from his mind or soul. 

If we try to talk to a rock, we will not get any feedback because the soul of the rock is undeveloped and cannot make independent expressions. 

So talking to another man lets us build the relation between him and our own soul. We can probe this relation better if we ask him questions.

This is what Socrtatic Dialectics does. This technique was also used in the Bhagavad Gita and the Analects by Confucius.
