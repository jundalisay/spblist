Unlike the Minkowski spacetime of Modern Physics which allows only 4 dimensions, the Cartesian View allows a maximum of 8
dimensions.

By doubling the sides of the first Tetractys, another Pythagorean Tetractys is constructed, of the number 36, the most famous and in all respects the most useful which they possessed, that is the triangle of numbers of which the
base is the Eightfold.

Dimension | Name | Manifestation
--- | --- | ---
1 | Existential | Identity
2 | Planar | 2-dimensional space
3 | Spatial | 3-dimensional space
4 | Temporal | Time
5 | Lateral | Alternate Realities
6 | Multiversal | Universes in the Multiverse
7 | Causal | Ultimate Cause

The 8 dimensions are based on the spacetime where ideas and experiences are generated. 

This includes the sequence of perceptions. For example, in the Existential, Planar, and Spatial dimensions, the concept of time is just of one moment, as there is no change or gaps in perceptions yet.

Linear time really begins in the Temporal dimension where changes take place. 

Nonlinear time begins in the Lateral dimension where alternate realities take place. In that dimension, switching between
realities is possible and time becomes less linear. 

An example is a  dream wherein experiences, as scenes, can jump from on to the other randomly. 

In the Multiversal dimension, multiple universes and therefore multiple spacetime exist.
