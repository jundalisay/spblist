The Wave-Nature of Reality means that one timespan or moment is connected to another timespan. 

The connection of these lead to the concept of time. 

But each of these timespans is really caused by 2 perceptions. The gap between these 2 perceptions is what we call timespan.

This means that timespan and time are effects of perception. 

But perception is merely a disturbance in the pure aether substance which is totally independent of other disturbances. 

This means that each perception is independent. 

Therefore time and timespan are dependent on the current perception. 

The error is that people think that the current perception is dependent on the past, just as the future is dependent on the present.

##  Monty Python Fallac


The same fallacy of treating events as not independent (as if there were a true starting point) is a fallacy of false motion or locality.
