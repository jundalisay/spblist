In the Republic of Plato, Socrates explains his concept of Guardians. 

These are strong warriors who are also philosophers. This is taken from the Spartans who known for their military skill as well as wisdom. 

Technically, this combines the Thinking and Warrior Classes.  

We can call them sages to emphasize the requirement of wisdom which we defined as an intellect that is in line with the dharma of the causes and effects in question.

Sages are the detectors of the abstract and subtle phenomena. They can process what they detected and also implement them in the real world. 


This means that they have 3 competencies:

Quality | Skill 
--- | ---
Spirituality | Ability to Detect Subtle Phenomena
Intellect | Ability to connect phenomena with Principles
Action | Ability to implement solutions or measures
