Chapter 7 explained that the physical universe or domain is the body of the Supreme Being, while the metaphysical universe is Its collective mind.

- Material Superphysics is the study of that body
- Bio Superphysics is the study of how that body interacts with its mind
- Social Superphysics is the study of how that mind works a collective


We then match this organization of study with the current ones: 

<!-- This likewise led to the concept of Material Superphysics as the sub-aspect of Superphysics to study that body. From this, we can organize Superphysics relative to Science: -->


Parts of Existence | Modern Version | Our Version 
--- | --- | ---
Absolute Entity (Pre-Existence) | Philosophy | Metaphysics
Supreme Entity (as a Concept) | Religion | Superphysics 
Supreme Entity (Mind) | Psychology | Social and Bio Superphysics
Supreme Entity (Body) | Science (with Physics as the core) | Bio and Material Superphysics


This physical universe is the subject of study of Material Superphysics just as the Supreme Entity is the subject of Superphysics.

<!-- , and the Absolute Entity is the subject of Metaphysics.   -->


{{< q a="Descartes" c="Principles of Philosophy, Preface" >}}
All Philosophy is like a tree.
- Metaphysics is the root
- Physics the trunk
- All the other sciences are the branches that grow out of this trunk.

We gather fruit from the extremities of the branches of trees, not from the roots or the trunks.

The subdivision of Superphysics into 3 matches the division made by Descartes:

<!--  is the 'trunk' from which emerges 3 main sciences: 

1. Material Superphysics
2. Bio Superphysics
3. Social Superphysics -->


{{< q a="Descartes" c="Principles of Philosophy, Preface" >}}
There are 3 principal sciences:
1. Medicine
2. Mechanics
3. Ethics
{{< /q >}}

<!-- The science of Morals is the highest and most perfect. Presupposing an entire knowledge of the other sciences, it is the last degree of wisdom. -->


## What is Superphysics?

Superphysics is the system of knowledge and study that abides by the main principles from the previous chapters:

Chapter | Principle
--- | ---
1 | The 2 Domains
2 | Ideas as Particles, Feelings as Waves
3 | Dynamism and The Law of Conservation of Idea 
4 | Cause and Effect, Qualimath, The Eagle
5 | 2 Forces, Territories, Influences
6 | Dharma
7 | Life and Mind
8 | 5 Layers
9 | The Supreme


{{< i s="/graphics/super/spmodel.jpg" a="Essential Superphysics concepts" c="Superphysics can be summed up as being based on the Supreme Entity, 2 Forces, 5 Elements, and Relationality" >}}


In a nutshell, Superphysics is **a paradigm that merges the known and proven perceptions of the physical and metaphysical domains (Chapters 1-2, 8) in order to find patterns (Chapters 3-5) and principles (Chapters 6-9) for the sake of solving problems**.

<!--  paradigm that sees the universe or reality as being made up of 2 Forces and 5 Layers. 

Superphysics is the paradigm that sees the universe as being made up of waves. -->

This combination of science and metaphysics will be opposed by materialists and so we push forward and ignore them totally. Instead, we use Nature as our arbiter -- our principles and predictions must match physical reality.  

{{< q a="Blavatsky" >}}
A minority strive to enlarge the domain of Physical Science by trespassing on the forbidden grounds of Metaphysics, so distasteful to some Materialists.
