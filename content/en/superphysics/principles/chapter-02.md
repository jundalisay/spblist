<!-- The Microlayers are the quantum subdivisions within the aethereal layer -->


Chapter 1 explained that reality is divided into the Physical and Metaphysical Domains. We therefore expand the word “reality”, which comes from the Latin word “res” meaning “things”, to include both physical and metaphysical phenomena. 

The ancients observed all natural phenomena and categorized them under 5 Elements which they called:

1. Earth
2. Water
3. Fire
4. Air
5. Aether

Modern Physics also observes phenomena, but only those that are of the physical kind. Instead of Elements, they base their observations on movement and have assigned 4 Fundamental Forces for all movement or change in the universe:

1. Strong Force
2. Weak Force   
3. Electromagnetism
4. Gravitation


## The Forces Have A Hierarchy

Modern Physics tells us that gravity can affect light, but light cannot affect gravity. 

Likewise, electromagnetism can affect iron, but ordinary iron does not exert electromagnetism. 

However, a mass of iron can exert a small amount of gravity, but not enough to affect light.  

It follows that the forces have a hierarchy, wherein gravity is superior to electromagnetism, and electromagnetism is superior to matter (as the Strong Force). 

To unify ancient and modern, we combine the 5 Elements and the 4 Fundamental Forces to create the 5 Layer Model of Superphysics.

These layers are the effect of the fight between the Positive and Negative Forces to be discussed in Chapter 3. We can say that reality is an arena for the fight between them.
- The journey from Pure Positivity to Pure Negativity is called *crudification*, which creation is part of
- The journey from Pure Negativity to Pure Postivity is called *subtilification*, which discovery is part of

Both creation and discovery are part of existence or reality -- you create something then discover or learn its uses, then create something new and so on.

## The Aethereal Layer

The aether is the substance of the abstract mind, as well as the ideas and feelings that are generated by that mind. 
- In Taoism, this is the water element. 
- In Hinduism, the aether is the *akasha*.
- In Cartesian-Spinozan Physics, this is *Substance*.

The aether has the least Negative Force and most of the Positive.

This leads to the concept of akashic records which leads to the concept of aethereal memory. This is different from the physical electronic memory in hard drives, computer chips, and brains.

Human, animal, and plant minds are sentient because they can tap into this aethereal memory which is of the same substance as their aethereal minds. 

Their sentience therefore comes from the Positive than the Negative. Humans are more advanced that animals because we have even more of the Positive Force.

Computers only have access to electronic memory and so are incapable of sentience. Therefore, the path to artificial sentience is to give computers the ability to access aethereal memory. 

Aethereal memory is the mechanism behind chance and karma, manifesting as good or bad luck. If you enter bad data into a database, then you will necessarily query bad data later. 

It would certainly be useful to know when your good or bad luck (resulting from your good or bad actons recorded by the aether) is scheduled to arrive (in spacetime or the Spatial Layer) so you can prepare for it. 

In this way, you won't be tossed around by chance and so have more manageable experiences in Existence.  

<!-- An aethereal mind can refer to either a physical mind or a non-physical one. 
- a physical mind resides in the brain.
- a non-physical mind is called a soul. It is above, or not bound by, the lower layers.  -->

Aethereal memory is processed by the aethereal mind just as electronic memory is processed by an electronic brain or circuit.  

The multiverse is itself is one huge aethereal mind, which the Hindus call **Brahma**. 
- In our matrix analogy, this mind can be seen as the RAM of a computer that generates its own virtual reality.

Each virtual reality in the Matrix is its own universe. Thus, our universe is just one of many. 

Unlike Science and New Age philosophy that puts emphasis on consciousness as to put all existential mysteries in it, Superphysics puts all the mysteries in the aethereal mind. 

This is because consciousness is just 'on' or 'off' just as existence either "exists" or "doesn't exist".  

Subscience | Use of the Aetheral Layer
--- | ---
Material Superhysics | As the basis of the Law of Conservation of Identity
Bio Superphysics | As the dynamics of the soul
Spiritual Superphysics | As the dynamics of the Crown, 3rd Eye, and Throat Chakras

<!-- The nature of this Mind then forms the subdivisions of Superphysics:

1. Material Superphysics - this studies the nature of the Mind of the physical universe
2. Bio Superphysics - this studies the nature of the Mind of a living being
3. Social Superphysics - this studies the nature of the Mind of society
4. Spiritual Superphysics - this studies the techniques to reach the Supreme or pure Positivity -->

<!-- Since the dynamics of Social Superphysics does not have a physical aspect, it does not have the 5 Layers. Instead, it has the 4 Cycles which is the effect of the 2 Forces.

'Mental Universe' falls under either:
- Superphysics, if it is abstract or theoretical
- Bio Superphysics, if it is in reference to the real world

Subscience | Description
--- | ---
Material Superhysics | The aether will be the key to manipulating spacetime
Bio Superphysics | The aether is represented by the 3 chakras: Top, Third-Eye, and Throat -->


## The Spatial Layer (Spacetime and Timespace)

<!-- gives the properties of time and space to ideas and feelings. This is represented by the Heart Chakra. -->

Spacetime is the key to understanding the aether which is above it.

This is why only long-running civilizations, such as the ancient Egyptians, Hindus, and Chinese, have a chance at unlocking the aether. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/multiverse.png" alt="Mutliverses" cap="The Spatial Layer splits the multiverse into discrete universes" >}}

Subscience | Use of the Spatial Layer
--- | ---
Material Superhysics | The start of physicality by providing the physical arena for the ideas as light, matter, objects, etc.  
Bio Superphysics | The chi, vayu, and chakras (as organic spatial vortices)
Spiritual Superphysics | The dynamics of the Heart Chakra



## The Radiant Layer (Electromagnetism)


This is where heat, light, light and polarity begins both in the physical and mental universe. 

Subscience | Use of the Radiant Layer
--- | ---
Material Superhysics | The start of electromagnetism
Bio Superphysics | The effects of heat and desire to the mind and body
Spiritual Superphysics | The dynamics of the Navel Chakra


In Cartesian Physics, the Radiant Layer is the start of matter. However, we do not adopt this as the start of matter in Superphysics is the Material Layer. 

<!-- Science already know a lot about this and the lower layers, so we do not need to add much.  -->


## The Convertible Layer

This is responsible for the diversity in the material universe and the physical body as well as experiences. 

<!-- change when acted on by heat, light, or matter.  -->

Subscience | Use of the Convertible Layer
--- | ---
Material Superhysics | This is the start of the Weak Force in Physics. It is responsible for 'flavor-changing' in particles
Bio Superphysics | This shows the evolution or change in cells and organisms, including reproduction
Spiritual Superphysics | The dynamics of the Sex Chakra


## The Material Layer

This is the crudest and most obvious layer, just as the aether is the subtlest and most mysterious layer. This is mostly Negative and is the end goal of creation and the start of discovery and learning. 

Subscience | Description
--- | ---
Material Superhysics | This is the start of the Strong Force in Physics
Bio Superphysics | This the actual physical cell. This also includes Western medicine wherein cells are made to interact with various material chemicals. 
Spiritual Superphysics | The dynamics of the Root Chakra


Isaac Newton assigns this as the start of matter, which we also adopt.


<!-- Layer | Positive Variation Example | Negative Variation Example
--- | --- | ---
Aethereal | Unconditional Love | Obsessive Love
Spatial | Universal Love | Nationalism
Radiant | Compassion | Greed
Convertible | Brotherly Love | Lust
Material | Selflessness | Self-preservation


Subdivisions of this love can be classified within these five, like 5 layers within a layer. For example, nationalism can be subdivided into:

Layer | Example
--- | --- 
Aethereal | Love for the nation's culture
Spatial | Love for global recognition
Radiant | Love for national economic growth
Convertible | Love for citizenship (versus Foreign Residents)
Material | Love for territory


Level of Mind | Behavior | Layer | Chakra
--- | --- | --- | --- 
10. Unstable goatish mind | driven by instincts | Material | Root
9. Foolish abstinent mind | strives to be moral | Convertible | Sex
8. Childlike fearless mind | seeks to believe in an eternally unchanging god | Convertible | Sex
7. Mind of selfless aggregates | seeks personal liberation | Radiant | Navel 
6. Mind free of karmic seeds | understands the process of conditioning | Spatial | Heart
5. Compassionate mahayana mind | has great compassion as it sees the consciousness in nature | Spatial | Heart
4. Mind awakened to the Unborn | realizes the void nature | Aethereal | Throat
3. Mind of the single way | realizes that all worlds are contained in a single thought within mind | Aethereal | Ajna
2. Mind of ultimate no-self-nature | penetrates all things but still dualistic | Aethereal | Ajna
1. Secret sublime mind | breaks through duality | Aethereal | Top
