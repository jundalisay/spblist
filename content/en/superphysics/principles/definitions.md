<!-- A soul is a mind separated from the body or brain. A mind is consciousness in active form made of three parts: ego (Sanskrit aham), mental field (Sanskrit citta) and its object (thought). ‘Cogito ergo sum’ has all three. Plants and animals have all three too and therefore have a soul, but most humans are just unable to put their egos into the ego of a plant or animal to verify this.  -->

Abstract Reasoning | The use logic to explain nonphysical or philosophical causes and effects.
Active Observation | Observing the object while probing it or doing actions on it.
Adharmic | not being in line with one's dharma or the nature of things. This replaces the concept of 'bad' or 'evil' which are based on the limited ego
Atheism | a belief system that negates the existence of a Supreme Entity
Attribute | a part of Substance.
Belief | a set of ideas that the ego attaches itself to
Conscience | the intuition or feeling for the dharma or true nature
Consciousness | the other half of Existence that lets Existence exist <!-- experiencer of experiences  -->
Critical Feeling | the expansion of one's feelings onto other entities other than the self, by exerting extra effort or energy
Critical Thinking | the expansion of one's thinking process beyond the normal limitations of belief or external imposition, by exerting extra effort or energy 
Death | The state where a mind loses the ability to express independently of the physical aspects of the universe
Dharma | The inherent, metaphysical nature of any discrete identity with reference to the creator of that identity 
Dharmic | Being in line with one's dharma or the nature of things. This replaces the concept of 'good' which is based on the limited ego.
Distance | the gap within identities
Eagle | the equation for everything, according to Superphysics
Ego | the feeling of the self 
Emotion | A quantized measurable version of a feeling, such as for public surveys
Entity | Anything that the mind regards as having an identity
Existence | the effect of Consciousness as its other half
God | an entity that represents either Enki or Enlil (Sumerian texts)
gods | entities that represent beings more advanced than humans with corresponding increase in power or abilities
Gravitational Signature | the unique code or idea that is the basis for the discrete entity. In a living body, this manifests as its DNA
Humor | Ability to make connections from seemingly unconnected things (Bashar)
Idea | An original metaphysical object created by the Supreme that is accessed by abstract minds. Also, a product of Ideation (accessing pre-existing ideas)
Ideology | a system of beliefs built around a centeral idea
Identity | A discrete resultant perception separate from other perceptions or a mass of perceptions
Immoral | the qualities of actions that will lead to negative feelings in the largest spacetime conceivable. Also generally adharmic since Existence is Positive.

Personality Structure | Determines the DNA patterns of the body in order to reinforce the belief system [samskara] (Bashar-causal)
Physics | The study of the Supreme Entity in its physical forms. This includes the 5 Layers or Elements. This absorbs the word 'science'
