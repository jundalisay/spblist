The qualitative ratio between identities represents our Theory of Universal Relationality* within the Theory of Dynamism. 

This states that all ideas are connected and therefore everything in the universe is connected. The ratio sign signifies this connection.

{{< n n="*We use Relationality instead of Relativity in order to rank better in search engines, since Relativity is already connected to Einsten instead of Descartes." >}}


This is a combination of the ideas from:
- The Asian sciences of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism which say that everything is one
- Socratic philosophy which explains about the One and the Other
- Descartes' theory of gravity which says that gravity is a relation between bodies
- Poincare's Law of Relativity which is based on changing states of bodies in a system



{{< q a="Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia Part 4, Article 202" >}}
I deny the existence of gravity inside any body. Gravity is a quality that depends on the relations of situation and motion of several bodies on each other.

This relation depends on point of view:

{{< q a="Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia Part 3, Article 13" >}}
Imagine a ship being carried out to sea. A person sitting at the stern might always remain in one place if we look at the parts of the ship, since he preserves the same location with respect to these. On the other hand, if we look at the neighbouring shores, the same person will seem to be perpetually changing place. We see him constantly receding from one shore and approaching another. If the earth moves from west to east exactly as the ship moves from east to west, we again say that the person at the stern does not change his place. This is because his place will be determined by certain immovable points in the heavens.

{{< q a="Leibniz" c="The Monadology, Article 52" >}}
When God compares two simple substances, he finds reasons in them to accommodate the one to the other. Consequently, what is active in certain respects is passive from a different point of view. A created being is:
- active in so far as what is known distinctly in it provides the reason for what happens in another created substance.
- passive in so far as the reason for what happens in it is found in what is known distinctly in another.

In this way, we can say that the universe is an unending chain of multiple layered ratios, as a matrix, where a change in one part causes a change in the whole universe as a chain-effect.

The lower dimensions like ours has more rigid ratios that lead to discrete and ‘hardened’ identities, while higher dimensions have more flexible ratios that lead to more malleable ones. 

Since the lower dimensions are more stubborn, they require more effort and energy to change than the upper dimensions.

An example of the “hardness” of this dimension is the hardness of will of Russia in invading Ukraine, and in Ukraine stubbornly not giving up. Both do not care about the chain-reaction that their fight causes to other nations and the planet. 

In a better universe (with qualimath as the norm), Russia, Ukraine, and NATO will “soften” their minds and egos (less strong force, more gravitational force) as to harmonize with each other, being more sensible how their actions affect the planet.

In this universe, such a softening can be encouraged by emphasizing the abstract, flexible aether, over rigid and hard solid matter. 

Because of this, Qualimath also creates moral effects. It conditions minds to respect the identity and natures of all sides (other egos), instead of bulldozing over them with arbitrary notations and movement towards one side as what Westerners tend to do. 

Qualimath uses Poincare’s Law of Relativity which uses state-change instead of Einstein’s Relativity which uses tensors:


{{< q a="Poincare" c="Science and Hypothesis, Chapter 5" >}}
The state of bodies and their mutual distances at any given moment, as well as the velocities with which those distances are changing at that moment, will depend only on the state of those bodies, on their mutual distances at the initial moment, and on the velocities with which those distances were changing at the initial moment. But they will not depend on the absolute initial position of the system nor on its absolute orientation, nor on the velocities with which that absolute position and orientation were changing at the initial moment.
