The vision of Superphysics is a new reality which has freed itself from the shackles of ego, materialism, and the Negative Force. 

This creates a transition period for learning the basics of how the universe really works. 

This is similar to high school level. 

Graduation from the high school level enables the human species to be employed for higher purposes such as doing service to the nearby star systems. 

Experience in our stellar neighborhood will then be the start of university where humans will learn how the entire galaxy works. 

This will then allow human employment for the service of the galaxy. 

Graduation from this level will lead to the masters level wherein humans can go beyond the galaxy and physical existence itself. 

Mastery of that level will allow huumans to evolve beyond physicality. At that point, Superhysics itself will need to be overhauled to explain the nature of non-physical reality. 



## Supereconomics

Supereconomics is Superhysics applied to Economics and resource allocation. 

It envisions a fair and sustainable points-based economic system that is based on the Four Laws of Value instead of Marginal Pricing and Money.

It also pushes for:
- Free trade with barter, as pool clearing, run by a world barter organization.
- Real time analytics




## Supersociology 
<!-- Social Superphysics -->

Supersociology is Superphysics applied to Sociology, Politics (Government), and Law (including Criminology)

It advocates federalism for national governments that are connected to a world government with its own constitution that coordinates issues between themselves.

It also pushes for:
- a constitution template for nations
- constitutioonal virtues
- binary elections
- resource branch of government
- profiling system according to the 7 chakras and the 4 cycles


<!-- **Coordinated governments instead of self-intereted governments** -->


## Material Superphysics

Material Superphysics is Superphysics applied to physical phenomena, including Classical and Quantum Mechanics. 

This aims for spaceships that are able to levitate and teleport between points in space.

It also pushes for:
- antimatter and fusion power
- precision fabrication using spacetime
- stifling nuclear reactions through the aether
- artificial natural intelligence 
- crystal computers
- room temperature superconductors


## Bio Superphysics

Bio Superphysics is Superphysics applied to living things. This includes Biology, Animal Husbandry, Agriculture, Medicine, Environmentalism, and Mental Health.

{{< i s="/photos/med/run.jpg" a="Woman running" >}}

It envisions a healthcare system that allows alternative medicine and also puts it on the same level as Western Medicine. 

It also pushes for:
- seawater agriculture
- sound-based agriculture
- Elemental industry
- maximized farming

 

## Spiritual Superphysics

Spiritual Superphysics is Superphysics applied to sprituality. 

{{< i s="/photos/meta/buddhism.jpg" a="Buddhism" >}}


This aims to made religious dogma and conflict obsolete. 

It also pushes for:
