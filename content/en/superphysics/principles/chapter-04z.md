Western moral philosophy focuses on the feelings of pain and pleasure as the basis for morality. 

The problme is that such feelings can either be physical or metaphysical (mental). 
- Physical pain can manifest as a wound or a toothache
- Metaphysical pain can manifest as the pain of  seeing your ex-partner happy with someone else, or the pain of not seeing our loved ones for a long time

Moreover, pleasure is usually associated with physicality such as eating delicious food, listening to our favorite music, having a relaxing massage, doing sexual acts, etc. 

We do not usually associate the word pleasure with giving relief goods to victims of disasters, or in solving the problem of our friends or customers. 

In such cases, we get a warm, lightweight feeling in our hearts instead of strong pleasureable semsations in our brains. 

This is why our basis for morality is not pain or pleasure, but ease and unease, or pain and agitation.
