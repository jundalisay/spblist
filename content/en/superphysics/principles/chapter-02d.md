The 5 Layers are the journey of an idea of the Supreme from metaphysical into physical reality. In Material Superphysics, this leads to an alternative theory to the Big Bang, which we call the Big Bootup.

{{< img src="/photos/physics/whitehole.jpg" alt="A whitehole" >}}

1. The Supreme Entity has an idea in the Aethereal Layer.
2. It is then deployed through a galaxy in a universe in the Spatial  Layer.
3. It then spreads as particles through the Radiant (electromagnetic) Layer.
4. It is then transformed by the Convertible Layer into atoms of the Material Layer.

This is also true for any phenomena:

1. You have an aethereal idea to bake a cake.
2. You walk to the space in the kitchen where the ingredients are.
3. You see the ingredients, such as flour, through light.
4. You put them together to convert the flour into a material cake.


This is why “mentality creates reality”, to be explained in Chapter 3. 

This truth is perpetually challenged by materialists who believe that the Material Layer is superior and so put forth the opposite maxim “seeing is believing” or “matter creates mind”. 


{{< q a="Marx" c="The German Ideology, Part 1" >}}
The production of ideas, consciousness, is at first directly interwoven with the material activity of men, the language 
of real life. Conceiving, thinking appear at this stage as the direct efflux of their material behaviour.

Since this materialist doctrine goes against how Nature works, it is no wonder that Communist and Capitalist systems* collapse by themselves from the inside instead of from any external force:
- The fall of the Soviet Union was begun by Gorbachev
- The 2008 Financial Crisis was begun by Wall Street banks 

* Communism is based on dialetical materialism, specifically the dominance of matter. Capitalism is based on economic materialism, specifically the love for money
