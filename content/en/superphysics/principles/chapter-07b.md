The root cause in the limitations in Physics (and consequently, in the technologies that humans can develop) is the limited ability of humans to perceive beyond the Radiant Layer (electromagnetism and light). 

<!-- The real cause of the absurdity is the scientific decree to make things measurable.  -->

Objective measurements are based on light giving our natural light-detectors (eyes) objective information. 

Beyond the Radiant Layer are the Spacetime and Aether layers where the measurements are naturally subjective. For example:
- The distance from House A to House B can be denoted in meters, yards, feet, etc.
- An idea can be important to some, but not important to others.  

We say that such measurements are subjective and heterogenous and thus are more qualitative instead of quantitative or homogenous. 

{{< q a="Sarkar" c="Idea and Ideology, Chapter 3" >}}
Hence, tanmátras [quantum-perceptions] are the waves produced by the objects as a result of reflection of the subtler bhúta [element or factor] on the cruder ones. Quantum-perceptions in the mathematical sense are **heterogeneous**, not homogeneous
{{< /q >}}


We can say that: 
- Materiality and Electromagnetism focus on quantitative particles
- Space, time, and feelings focus on qualitative waves

<!--  wich c as the ghighest kind of ruler. The wohole big giat problem is that the aetehr is above spacetime whtih itselfis above lectromagentism. So The aether is not measurebale by sight or electronic eqiupement fof the electomagneic layer and is onlyindirectly measurable by the spacetime layer. 

This neesd a whole new math which we call qualimath which measures chanigng aetereal qualities instead of discrete material quantities.  -->

<!-- We can further simplify math by  -->

We thus assign qualities to our deconstructed equations. 

<!-- This is also because waves are more qualitative than quantitative in nature.    -->

<!-- To get around this shortage, we will use *the qualitative aspects of waves* that combines its qualities such as amplitude, oscillation, vector, wavelength, etc.  -->

For example, in `Wave 1 + Wave 2 = Wave 3`, we assign qualities instead of numbers and processes so we can arrive at the general outcome faster. 

The `+` and `=` represent the natural actions of the human mind. The minds of less advanced species, such as penguins, might be capable of `+` and `-`, but are not capable of `*` or `/`. 

Likewise, human minds seem to be limited to `=` and do not dwell so much on `:` which reqresents the hidden connection between things.*

{{< n n="*Bio Superphysics explains this to be caused by humans eating crude food such as meat which then crudifies the thinking process." >}}


<!-- Since it deals with qualities instead of quantities, we can call it **Decon Notation** and its underlying system as **Quali-math**.  -->

This solves measurement problems by allowing anyone to create a *subjective* measure. For example, assuming a predefined intuitive range of qualitative* values which *focus* on looks:


``` elixir
abominable, hideous, very ugly, ugly, unattractive, soso, pretty, beautiful, very beautiful, gorgeous, drop-dead gorgeous
```

{{< f f="*Qualities are subjective" >}}


Then we can create equations:

``` elixir
pretty + pretty = beautiful
beautiful + 2(ugly) = ugly
hideous + beautiful = ugly
```

This can then be “translated” into any language*:

``` elixir
maganda + maganda = sobrang ganda
kaakit-akit + kadiri = napaka-pangit
dep + dep = rat dep
```

{{< n n="*This is important because Superphysics uses many non-English words like aether, monad, jiva, atman, bhuta, guna, chi, wu-xing, etc. In fact, we propose an overhaul of English, as Lish, to make it more intuitive.

<!-- In a future post, we will expand this into chemical compounds computation, and in linear algebra to produce general qualitative outcomes instead of exact quantitative answers.  -->

A sample implementation is our use of [male and female charges](/material/principles/part-3/chapter-04/) for particles instead of the "positive and negative" used by Benjamin Franklin. In theory, this would lead to new chemical compounds that are unthinkable in Physics, since it is more intuitive to combine different kinds of males with different kinds of females. 

This quali-math will make the most sense when you think of a spaceship using quantum teleportation that not only will use 2D space as in a car on Earth or a 3D space like an aircraft, but a space with 4 or 5 dimensions as time-multiverses and alternative universes, where normal math breaks down.

For example, `1 + 1 = 2` might be true for this universe, but it might not be true for a different universe where `1 + 1 = 1` or where the conception of two ideas automatically merges them into one idea. In such a universe, it is the mind that splits itself into different perception-units in order to create the idea of numbers. This is the opposite in our universe, where the perceiving entity is one, and the it is the observed entities that are multiples and discrete. 


## The Double Colon as Mirror

To account for this mind-splitting behavior, <!--  make ratios and relationality permanent, --> we propose a new notation using flexible colons instead of the rigid equals sign. The former represents the flexible nature of the universe as opposed to its strict rigidity as the latter.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/math.jpg" alt="Mathematics" >}}

- The single colon is like a flexible ratio. You can think of this as a hazy mirror that lets the other side look a bit different 
- The double colon is like a rigid equals sign. This is a clearer mirror but still not a perfect reflection.
- The triple colon is a strict equality that involves the kinds of data*. This is a perfect mirror. 


{{< n n="*In programming this is similar to =, ==, and ===. Notice how we are coercing math to follow computer programming" >}}

### The Theory of Universal Relationality

This ratio represents our theory of "universal relationality*" which is represented in reality by [gravitational relationality](/material/principles/part-2/chapter-04), among others.

All philosophers say that everything is connected, even the sophistical pseudo-philosopher John Stuart Mill. 

The ratio sign signifies this connection. 

In this way, we can say that the universe is an unending chain of multiple layered ratios, as a matrix, where a change in one part causes a change in the whole universe as a chain-effect. This is because in Cartesian Physics, which is one basis of Superphysics, there is no void in Nature (i.e. God is everywhere in Spinoza-speak). 

The lower dimensions like ours has more rigid ratios that lead to discrete and 'hardened' identities, while higher dimensions have more flexible ratios that lead to more malleable ones.

Since the lower dimensions are more stubborn, they require more effort and energy to change than the upper dimensions. So it makes sense for enlightened entities to spend their energy going into the higher dimensions instead of wasting energy in the lower dimensions trying to convince crude-minded materialists that God exists or that the universe is conscious. 


#### Update March 10, 2022

An example of the "hardness" of this dimension is the hardness of will of Russia in invading Ukraine and in Ukraine stubbornly not giving up, not caring about the chain-reaction that it causes to other nations and the planet. 

In a better universe (with qualimath as the norm), Russia, Ukraine, and NATO will "soften" their minds and egos (less strong force, more gravitational force) as to harmonize with each other, being more sensible how their actions affect the planet.

In this universe, such a softening can be encouraged by emphasizing the abstract, flexible aether, over rigid and hard solid matter.

## The State Limiter

In `1 + 1 = 2`, the mind sweeps from the left to the right. But in `(1 + 1) :: 2`, the mind splits itself into the left and the right. It becomes an impartial spectator* of both sides or states.

{{< f f="*This idea was developed by Adam Smith who criticized the sophistical math of the mercantile system. Such sophistry now manifests as the strict demand for GDP growth by Economics which is currently causing mass exctinction and conflicts. Economics enshrines growth because it has imposed money-only as the means of transaction. The problem is that money is an inert and static thing that gets its value from being exchanged. This mindless, self-destructive, constant exchange gives movement, growth, and consequently value." >}}


In this way, the formula of economist John Maynard Keynes for money supply `M` as being affected by liquidity preference `L` and interest rate `r` 

```elixir
M = Lr
```

becomes:


```elixir
M :: (L : r)
```

when deconstructed:

```elixir
money_supply :: (liquidity_preference : interest-rate)
```

This translates to "the money supply is totally dependent on the love of cash and the profits in lending (or cost of borrowing) cash"



Likewise, Newton's gravity changes from 

```elixir
F = (Gm1m2)/r^2
```

into


```elixir
F :: (G (m1/r^2 : m2/r^2))
```


Notice how this isolates Newton's `G` away from the two masses being compared. 

We then deconstruct it in Cartesian Physics further:

<!-- `gravity between objects :: Gravitational_limiter (Mass1 / distance_between_them ^ 2 : Mass2 / distance_between_them ^ 2)` -->
<!-- material-layer-gravitational-signature -->

```elixir
gravity_between :: (material_layer_limiter (matter_amount_in_identity1 / distance_between^2 : matter_amount_in_identity2 / distance_between^2)
```

This translates as "the pushing force of spacetime between 2 material identities depends on the quantity and quality of matter in them and their distance from each other."

In future posts, we can apply the same technique to Maxwell's equations to show how the spacetime, radiant, and material layers work together to create Electromagnetism.  




In price equations, this will allow us to more easily remove the influence of interest rates (of the financial system) and taxes (of the government) in order to reveal the natural price ratios from their own perspective. 

The gravity, interest rates, and taxes enter their own abstraction called a *limiter*. Notice how this system does not require PEMDAS because of the allowance for mind-splitting behavior.


## Math with a Practical and Moral Purpose Inspired by Al-Khwarizmi and Descartes


The above decontstructed equation "`gravity_between`" gives us 2 benefits:

1. Practical: It helps us *code* the equation more easily into procedures and algorithms
2. Moral: It makes us think of `Mass1` and `Mass2` independently, and separate from its limiter

Quali-math is inspired by **Al-Khwarizmi** who invented algebra from his work on "Calculation by Completion and Balancing". 

The practical purpose leads to algorithms, the invention of which has likewise been attributed to Al-Khwarizmi*.

{{< img cap="Automated Natural Intelligence is best used in space-time-ships, just as it is best applied currently in Tesla's self-driving cars" src="/photos/physics/phoenix.jpg" >}}


{{< n n="*The original purpose of Algebra (Al-Jebra or 'the repair or healing') was to divide an estate and compute the inheritance due to each heir. <!-- The Europeans seemed to have used it for warmaking --> This matches the problem-solving nature of Superphysics. This is opposite of Einstein's math as sophistical tensors coming from his wild imagination which creates more problems. It is also different from Newton's Calculus which originated from plotting curvilinear motion. Superphysics allows teleportation which totally negates curvilinear motion." >}}
   

An algorithm is an implementation or processing of a model. This processing is automated by computers as machine learning, which is the automation of natural intelligence, which is wrongly called artificial intelligence. We call it properly as [Automated Natural Intelligence](/superphysics/solutions/isaiah) (ANI) and is one of the goals of Superphysics.


Qualimath will allow an AI-driven* ship that teleports into another universe, which has different physics, to transpose its logic and definitions more easily to match that universe. This is because it uses quality instead of quantity.

{{< n n="*The mind-splitting behavior in Qualimath can be implemented with computers with multiple independent cores (Update 2024: This is now done by GPUs which have multiple cores). In humans, this is naturally done in families and societies. The family mind is split between the father, mother and children. The society's mind is split between the different classes represented by political parties and special-interest groups. This is why we can readily apply Qualimath to Social Superphysics to make predictions in economics and politics." >}}

  
 

A qualitative definition in one’s mind retains itself even if its mind moves into another universe. *This is because that defintion is always anchored in the ego (feeling of the self) of that mind.* This was implied by Adam Smith:

{{< q a="Smith" c="Theory of Moral Sentiments" >}}
I can only fairly compare those big objects and the small objects near me by transporting myself in fancy, to a place from where I can survey both at equal distances, and judge their real proportions.
{{< /q >}}

{{< img src="/graphics/movement.png" alt="Superphysics Movement" cap="Qualimath uses Poincare's Law of Relativity which uses aethereal state-change instead of Einstein's Relativity which uses tensors" >}}



Because of this, Qualimath also creates moral effects. It conditions minds to respect the identity and natures of all sides (other egos), instead of bulldozing over them with arbitrary notations and movement towards one side as what Westerners tend to do. 

While the practical aspect is based on [Al-Khwarizmi](/research/musa/algebra/chapter-01), this moral aspect is based on Rene Descartes who invented exponents and the Cartesian plane, among others, from his realizations on how the mind works*, as well as David Hume from whom Adam Smith got his ideas.


<!-- This is in line with the Hindus inventing zero to represent the existence of nothingness. Rather, zero implies that space is empty *but is actually meant by Nature to be filled* (since Nature abhors a vacuum). The Romans and the ancient Chinese did not have such an advanced metaphysical concept. Aristotle had, but did not seem to deploy it into reality.

Qualimath also bridges modern math, which 'prefers' single integers or the small picture or 'micro', with ancient Egyptian math, which 'prefers' the large view or 'macro'. Thus, it harmonizes the different ways of looking at existence, making it more flexible and dynamic:

- Modern math from the micro going macro
- Ancient Egyptian math from the macro going micro
- Hindu (Vedic) math grouping and scaling identities via zero
