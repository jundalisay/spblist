Unlike Physics which makes its equations and principles from the motion of bodies, Superphysics bases its principles on the changes in the perceived identities. 

Motion, or change in location, is just one of such changes. Another change is from small to large, like a seed turning into a plant, or a change from poverty to prosperity, as in a society.

Our principles are therefore derived from the perceived changes in state. From here it follows that:
- the universe is inherently dynamic
- there is an inherent potential dynamism in each object
- an object’s dynamism can be tapped by letting it interact with the proper objects other than itself
- the dynamism of objects depend on their relations with each other 

This is the foundation of our Theory of Dynamism. 

This theory aims to know the causes and effects of all change and movement, whether physical or metaphysical. 

This is to harness such movement and dynamism in order to reach our goals, such as to solve problems that are unsolved by Physics and Science.

In the metaphysical domain, these movements take the form of reflection (as the ‘bouncing back’ mentioned in Chapter 1), deflection, dissipation, merging, etc. 

These are the dynamics of waves. Thus, we say that the metaphysical domain has a wave-like nature.
