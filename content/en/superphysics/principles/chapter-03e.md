Some Taoist schools say that it does not matter whether the Yin-Yang symbol is shown in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. We say that it *does* matter. The symbol should always be in a **counterclockwise or Positive direction**. 

{{< i s="/icons/tao.png" a="Yin Yang" >}}

This is proven by most of the planets in our solar system rotating in counterclockwise direction. Venus was once habitable when it rotated counterclockwise. We hypothesize that it became hell when it flipped into a clockwise direction.

Moreover, Yang should always be on top as implied by the Tao-te-Ching. This is because aethereal ideas have a shape which implies a proper orientation (right-side up). 

An idea can be learned, or a problem can be solved, faster by approaching the idea or problem **at the right angle that matches its orientation.** This is similar to a spaceshuttle re-entering earth at a proper angle to avoid burning up. 

This angle and shape are consequences of the Negative force which surrounds each idea or identity in order to separate it from other identities.

Without the knowledge of this shape, the only alternative is to approach a big problem from all possible angles, leading to a waste of time and effort.

Some problems are so complex that the proper angle is hard to achieve with the hit-or-miss approach. This is why Superphysics will be able to solve problems, even the complex ones, faster than Science which has no concept of the geometry of ideas.

Plato alludes to this through the five Platonic shapes. 

{{< q a="Timaeus" >}}
“The first 3 regular solids are formed from the right triangle:
1. The tetrahedron
2. The octahedron
3. The icosahedron
4. The cube, from isosceles
5. The dodecahedron, from 12 pentagons”

Superphysics visualizes these through the Aethereal Cartesian plane which will be done by machine learning, since it's too complicated for a human.

We actually use this technique to come up with solutions to economic crises and social crises faster than Economists or Sociologists. The problem is in implementing those solutions in the physical real world because of the static 'aether-drag' in human minds.


## Positive and Negative Direction

<!-- date: 2024-05-10 -->

Closely related to the geometry of ideas is the idea of directions. 

In the Asian sciences of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism:
- Yang or Shiva, as the Positive Force, moves in a counterclockwise direction
- Yin or Shakti, as the Negative Force, moves in a clockwise direction.

This is seen in:
- the Taoist Yin-Yang symbol
- the Hindu swastika.

However, the word 'counter' in counter-clockwise seems opposite of the word 'positive'. We would expect instead that clockwise would be positive and counter-clockwise would be negative.

To fix this, we create a clock that is in line with Nature, by putting the starting point at the bottom instead of from the top. 

{{< img src="/graphics/super/direction.jpg" alt="Natural Timekeeping Direction" >}}

We often read left to right, just as many people are right-handed. So from the bottom, we start counting naturally to the right. We call this natural movement as the Positive Movement in the Positive Direction. 

Its opposite is to read from the right to the left. We call this the Negative Movement in the Negative Direction. 

Unlike the Western clock that starts from the top, in a position of ego, our clock starts from the bottom, in a position of humility or nothingness. This is in line with the natural concept of Zero.
