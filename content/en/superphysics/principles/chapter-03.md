The Sequence of Creation in Chapter 2 explained that our universe is a result of the Creator having an aethereal idea of a universe that eventually materialized by going down the 5 Layers. 

But how does the Creator create ideas from nothing?

And how did It push those ideas down to turn them into physical reality?


## Pre-Existence and the Absolute Entity as Void

Before Existence began, the Creator had nothing, not even the medium of the aether, to create ideas with. 

We call this state Pre-Existence and refer to the Creator in this state as the Absolute Entity to imply Its Nothingness.

Since it is beyond Existence then both **Pre-Existence and the Absolute Entity do not exist and are merely theoretical**. 

Since these do not exist we can say that only the Probability Layer is working at that state.


{{< q a="Parmenides" >}}
If there is one thing, then it cannot be many and cannot have parts. If it cannot have parts, then it cannot be a whole.. and will have neither beginning, middle, nor end, for these would be parts of it. Thus, the One has no beginning nor end. It is unlimited and therefore formless.

We create such a theoretical state in order to prevent minds from thinking of what came before the universe was created. Doing so will open up paradoxes and infinities that will waste mental energy.

Therefore, our concept of Pre-Existence serves as an instant “sink” that will positively absorb and nullify that thinking effort (as opposed to a wall which blocks the thinking tendency and is therefore negative).

We will thus never enter disputes about the infinite. This is because we are finite. It would be absurd for us to try to determine the infinite.

### What came before pre-existence?

The concept of pre-existence absorbs all ideas. So if the mind asks 'what came before pre-existence'? Then there is no need to reate another concept called 'Pre-pre-Existence' just to stabilize that desire of consciousness to know. 

This is because it is really the **desire** to know that is causing such a curiosity. So it would be better to deal with the asker's desire -- why does he want to know what existed before Existence? It could be a sign that:
- he has too much time on his hands
- he has no control of his thoughts, or 
- his Luna mount is too strong, etc.
