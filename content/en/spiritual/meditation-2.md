Previously, I wrote how the world's biggest problems, whether war or global warming, are caused by selfishness. 

The solution to this selfishness is to trace out how it forms in the first place.

This happens when our senses continually bombard our one-and-the-same mind over and over with various perceptions. 

As time passes, this creates or solidifies the feeling of the self within the mind. 
- This feeling is called the ego. 

It is easy to notice how children are less selfish and have more simple emotions than adults. 
- This is also seen in isolated tribesmen whose minds are less bombarded with the sensory perceptions of a large, fast-paced city.

We also notice how modern people are often so agitated and addicted to sensory perceptions from their mobile phones and social media that they have no time even to take care of their bodies or relationships with other humans. 

Physical sensory perceptions are a huge contributing factor to the formation of ego. 

This is why the Asian sciences of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism push for the control of the senses. For this, they impose moral precepts or rules, similar to how Christianity has the 10 Commandments and Islam has Shariah Law.

In this series, I will divide the path towards sense-control into two:

1. Moral Precepts 
2. Actual Sense-Withdrawal       


## Moral Precepts as a Prerequisite to Sense Withdrawal 

In Hinduism, Existence (Brahma) is a thought-projection of the Supreme Consciousness (Purusa).

In other words, the universe is an imagination of God. Therefore, before anything exists in reality, it must exist in mentality first. 

This is easily observed in our daily lives. 
- If we **want** to get up early for work then we get up early for work. This then creates the reality of us being at our workplace early.
- If we **don't want** to go to work, then we don't go to work. This creates the corresponding reality of us not being at work. 

So the first step towards sense-control is to have a mentality to want to have sense-control. 

This is done by imposing mental reminders, rules, or precepts on one's mind as long as that desire exists. We will discuss the Hindu rules, called *Yama* and *Niyama*, as they are old, yet part of a system (as opposed to the standalone 10 Commandents).

We start with the 5 Yamas which Patanjali lists as follows.

{{< img src="/graphics/meta/yamas.jpg" alt="Yamas" >}}


#### 1. Ahimsa (Non-Violence)

This imposes on the mind not to harm others nor do violence in action or in thought. 

Shallowly, this has the same effect as 'Thou shalt not kill' and is the basis for the vegetarian diet. However, since harm goes beyond physicality, it is also applied to prevent mental and emotional harm.


#### 2. Satya (Truthfulnes)

This imposes on the mind not to tell lies. 

Shallowly, this has the same effect as 'Thou shalt not bear false witness'. Often, the mind deceives others in order to protect and preserve its ego. 

Truthfulness applies not only to word, but also to deed. For example, if you say you will meet someone at 5pm, then you should meet at 5pm and not be late.   


#### 3. Asteya (Non-stealing)

This imposes on the mind not to steal whether physical or non-physical. 

Shallowly, this has the same effect as 'Thou shalt not steal'. We often want many things in life that we cannot have. And so stealing is a common crime in all cultures. 

Asteya goes beyond physical theft, into psychological or intellectual theft, like when we claim credit for something that we did not do.


#### 4. Brahmacarya (Seeing all as the Supreme)

This imposes on the mind to see everything as an aspect of the Supreme. 

Traditionally, this has been interpreted as celibacy and shallowly therefore, this has the same effect as 'Thou shalt not commit adultery' and to not waste one's seed in Christianity.

However, the Sankrit translation simply means to see all as God. This means to respect everyone and everything. This includes avoiding lustful thoughts on the other sex. 


#### 5. Aparigraha (Focus on Needs, not Wants)

This imposes on the mind to be content and to focus on needs. 

Shallowly, this has the same effect as 'Thou shalt not covet'.

The mind is constantly bombarded with sense-perceptions, some of which create unsustainable desires or wants. For example, we see a woman in expensive clothes and so our egos form an association create the desire for such clothes. If they are beyond our means, then we might lie, cheat, or steal for them. 

So this yama strikes at the root by imposing on the mind to focus on needs and not on wants. In Islam, this is similar to the emphasis on modesty and non-extravagance. 

If you notice, the Yamas are all about negative impositions as "do not's". These serve to suppress the ego. 

In the next post, I will explain the Niyamas which are the "do's" that will help the mind transform the ego into a positive holistic, non-selfish entity.
