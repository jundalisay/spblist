The universe is very fast, and is just one in the multiverse of infinite, arbitrary universes.


This makes it a wild west where aynthing goes, as long as it is within the rules of Nature. 

These rules are very exact for the lower layers, such as matter, but very loose for the upper ones such as the aether and spacetime. 

People in the lower layers find themselves in chaos. 

The solution by the entities in the upper layers is dharma which is an internal set of rules. 

This is because the upper layers allows such a flexibility. 

This dharma then insulates the entities inside it from the chaos within, and also of the lower layers.
