### The Immorality of Krishna

In Discourses on Mahabharata Chapter 6, Indian philosopher PR Sarkar explained the immorality of Krishna who deceived Drona as part of his intention to kill him.

Basically, Drona was a strong warrior king who caused division among the Indian rulers. 

Krishna was another king who wanted to unify India. 

To achieve this goal, he needed Drona killed.  

His tactic was to take advantage of Drona's affections for Ashwatthama, Drona's son. 
- There was an elephant named Ashwatthama. 
- Krishna had that elephant killed. 
- This then spread the news that Ashwatthama, the elephant had been killed.

Drona heard this during a battle and thought it meant that his son has been killed. 
- This made him grieve and lower his guard.
- This allowed him to be killed.


### Morality is Technically Different From Dharma

Krishna violated the morality of Satya or truthfulness and Ahimsa or non violence by purposely intending to deceive and kill Drona.

In Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, Satya and Ahimsa are part of Yama and Niyama which are the foundation of yogic morality.

 <!-- system or spirituality -->

Sarkar clarified that such violations of morality are ok because it was for the greater cause of the dharma.

Therefore, dharma is superior to Yama and Niyama or morality.

{{< i s="/graphics/meta/morals.png" a="Morality Flow" c="Dharma breaks through the cycle of cause and effect or action and reaction" >}}


Superphysics uses the following definitions:

Concept | Definition
--- | ---
Morals | The qualities of actions that will lead to **positive** feelings in the largest spacetime conceivable
Dharma | The inherent, metaphysical **nature** of any discrete identity with reference to the creator of that identity
Positive Feelings | Feelings, such as happiness, conviction, peace, relief, etc. from the **Positive Force**
Negative Feelings | Feelings, such as depression, fear, confusion, distress, etc. from the **Negative Force**
The Positive Force | The force or flow from the desire of Existence that leads to **unification** and attraction. This is Yang in Taoism, and roughly the Holy Spirit in Christianity
The Negative force | The force leading to actual Existence via **separation**, repulsion, and isolation. This is Yin in Taoism, and roughly the Devil in Christianity
Yoga | The **union** created by the Positive Force
<!-- As proof, the Supreme Command imposes Yama and Niyama only as means towards achieving union with the Supreme after one dies 🛏️  -->



The concepts of "morality", "dharma", and "yoga" are all related to the Positive and Negative Forces. 
- These 2 Forces can be revealed to be either Positive of Negative by the effect that they produce. 


### Dharma Overcomes the Fear of Death

Yoga is the *union* of the 2 Forces, as the peace between 2 warring factions.  

Dharma is the *concept* of the **natural journey** towards this union. The *actual* journey is called Tao in Taoism.  
- This union or yoga is therefore dharma seen from the end of the journey.  
- The start of the journey is Existence
- The undertaking of the journey is spirituality


Without spirituality, Existence just goes in circles, without any goal of union and therefore no dharma. This takes the form of the unending cycle of cause and effect, which also leads to the cycle of birth and rebirth.  

Morality is the set of rules while on the journey, to keep it spiritual and fixed to the goal instead of going in circles. This breaks the cycle of cause and effect and consequently the cycle of birth and rebirth. 

This then is used to eliminate the fear of death which is commonly the strongest fear among living creatures.   

So morality is the toolkit to achieve yoga or union.
- In Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, Yama and Niyama are essential requirements for yoga (and special powers). 

The whole reason for Krishna violating morals was to unify India and create Mahabharata or a yoga of India. So he changed the moral rules temporarily in order to bring back people to the dharma. 


### The Corruption of Morality

But this opens a can of worms if dharma is corrupted to mean union to petty and crude (tamasic) things like money, ego, and shallow pleasures.

For example, the CEO of Goldman Sachs believed that greedy bankers are doing God's work.

Therefore, prior to dharma, "sentient" and "crude" must be defined. This can be done naturally by comparing one's feelings.

This is why the Vedas classified actions into 3 gunas, which we call the 3 influences:

Concept | Definition
--- | ---
Sentient | The qualities of the Positive Feelings and Actions
Mutative | The qualities that are neither ultimately Positive nor Negative
Crude | The qualities of the Negative Feelings and Actions


So an action or feeling is exposed as either sentient, mutative, or crude by experiencing its ultimate effect, in the same way that the Positive and Negative are exposed. 

But the big problem is that crude people, such as Drona and greedy bankers, feel that the crude is also sentient.
- **This is because a crude pleasure is still a pleasure and not a pain**.

Sarkar's solution is to strike such crudity with a hammer. This is consistent with Krishna violating morality to impose dharma.  


So from this logic, the killing of the UHG CEO was **immoral** but **karmic**, not really **dharmic**. 
- It is incorrect to say that it was good or bad because good and bad can be defined in a number of ways
- It can also not be called dharmic because there was no higher purpose in it

{{< i s="/photos/countries/us/uhg.jpg" a="UHG CEO" c="The UHG CEO on the left, and his killer on the right" >}}

> The killing of the UHG CEO was *immoral* but *karmic*

Such a murder could be considered dharmic if it were done with an intention towards a unifying solution such as an efficient and fair state-run health insurance system.
- It is immoral to kill.
- But it is also natural for someone, who has caused the *actual* deaths of people, to himself die from the people that could have died because of him.

Karmic comes from the word karma or action. 

All actions lead to reactions since there is no Void in Nature or Brahma, which represents the totality of Existence or the macro view.

Karma is a concept associated with Existence instead of spirituality. In fact, the union of the Supreme puts an end to all karma by getting rid of invididual Existences (jiva) or mico views. 


### The Jiva or Micro Versus the Brahma or Macro

The difference between morality and dharma is the difference between the rules of the journey and the journey itself. 
- The mirco-entities in the journey are jiva which need to be put under rules.
- The macro-entity is the Brahma which is journeying to eliminate Its internal war caused by the 2 Forces.  

The micro or jiva will naturally and properly see the murder of the UHG CEO as immoral. But the macro or Brahma will see it as:
- dharma if it leads to a fair, state-run health insurance system
- karma if it does not 


This is similar to the California wildfires, seen by the jiva, as being an immoral act of Nature killing and giving grief to innocent people.

But to Brahma, it is:
- dharma if it leads to a universal effort to reduce CO2 emissions
- karmic if it does not 

Therefore, **we can only properly classify the morality or spirituality of any action if we take the macro perspective by expanding the mind out of its micro confinement caused by the Negative Force.** 

This will let us know if any action, whether by ourselves or others, is:
- crude or sentient
- dharmic or karmic
- moral or immoral
- spritual or anti-spiritual 


{{< q a="Patanjali" c="Yoga Sutras, Chapter 2" >}}
The ego assigns the power of awareness to the self. The ego then pursues desires for pleasure and avoids suffering.

The ego then, even of a wise person, seeks to preserve itself.

These causes of suffering can be removed by seeing subtly where they come from and reversing course.

Intense meditation destroys their patterns.
{{< /q >}}


Adam Smith uses the concept of conscience or the impartial spectator as the morality classifier.
- In our system, this is Positive higher mind judging the Negative lower mind or ego. 

This expansion of mind towards the Positive* is done by reversing the Negative course that produced the ego as the jiva in order to become the macro or Brahma. This is done through meditation which is only possible if one adopts moral rules. 

{{< f f="The expansion of the mind in general is acquisition of knowledge and feelings" >}}


### The Morality of Killing Evil Leaders

The morality of killing evil leaders is only a rare policy that is adopted when the Negativity has gained dominance to the point that immoral people become leaders.

In Social Superphysics, this happens in all 4 cycles. 

But it is most adharmic when the immoral warriors are from warrior class and second most-adharmic when they are from the oligarch or trading class.
- King Drona was an immoral warrior
- Investment bankers, as majority shareholders, are immoral oligarchs (i.e. CEOs are agents for such shareholders)

In the worker cycle, this happens as extra-judicial killings wherein lowly criminals are killed, as done by Philippine President Duterte. However, since Duterte did not really have a unifying solution because of his ignorance of moral philosophy, then his actions are merely karmic. 

So we can classify karmic and dharmic killing actions:

Karmic | Dharmic
--- | ---
UHG CEO murder | Murder of Drona by Krishna
Duterte extra judicial killings | The execution of Nazi leaders after WWII
California wildfires and typhoons in Asia killing people | 


<!-- We rarely hear of popular but immoral leaders being killed (as part of the working class), and even rarer to hear of thought leaders with false theorists being killed (as part of the intellectual class).     -->


<!-- , and Shiva are all synonymous and are superior to morality  -->
