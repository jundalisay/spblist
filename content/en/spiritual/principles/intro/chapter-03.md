<!-- Aether Mechanics: Consciousness and Samadhi -->

{{< youtube lISLgasNjHk >}}

Both existence and the abstract minds that perceive existence are made up of the aether.

A mind has a hole, called consciousness, which allows the perceptions of existence to pass through. 

The flow of these perceptions changes the mind. Crude perceptions cause the mind to constrict. This reduces consciousness. 

Subtle perceptions cause the mind to dilate. This expands consciousness. 

Savikalpa samadhi is when consciousness becomes as large as the abstract local universe.  

Nirvikalpa samadhi is when consciousness becomes as large as abstract existence. 

At such expanded states, the stretched mind can no longer maintain its constricted identity. And so it breaks and melts into existence.
