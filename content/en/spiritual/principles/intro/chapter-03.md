<!-- Aether Mechanics: Consciousness and Samadhi -->

{{< youtube lISLgasNjHk >}}


Someone asked us how the Vedas and Tantra Yoga would explain metaphysical concepts such as reality and existence. 

The vedas are the collection of knowledge gained by the Aryans in their journey from Southern Russia into Northern India. 

In India they encountered Shiva who is the founder of Tantra. The goal of Tantra is yoga or union of the small mind with the Supreme Mind. 

So the Tantras got absorbed into the Vedas. 

What is reality?
