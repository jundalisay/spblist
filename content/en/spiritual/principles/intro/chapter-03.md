<!-- Aether Mechanics: Consciousness and Samadhi -->

{{< youtube lISLgasNjHk >}}


Someone asked us how the Vedas and Tantra Yoga would explain metaphysical concepts such as reality and existence. 

The vedas are the collection of knowledge gained by the Aryans in their journey from Southern Russia into Northern India. 

In India they encountered Shiva who is the founder of Tantra. The goal of Tantra is yoga or union of the small mind with the Supreme Mind. 

So the Tantras got absorbed into the Vedas. 

What is reality? 

Reality is an effect of perception. 

Perception is a disturbance in a line in the aether or akasha, which is the substance for existence. This is because existence exists as a thought-projection of the Supreme Mind as the Brahman. The resulting existence is called Brahma.

The disturbances in the Supreme Mind manifests as waves and create existence.

A perceiving mind within that Supreme Mind is also a disturbance that encounters other disturbances. 

In Cartesian Physics, these are called vortices instead of disturbances. 

A richer perception therefore is made up of multiple waves of disturbance hitting a disturbance that is also more complex than others. 

Having no perception is perceiving no disturbance and therefore no mind. 


## The Superiority of the Metaphysical over the Physical

The waves are of different kinds.

Some are very thick and forceful. Others are thin and subtle.

Physical existence is made up of thick, crude, waves. 

Metaphysical existence is made up of thin subtle waves. 

Metaphysical subtle waves can pass through crude waves. 

But physical waves cannot pass through subtle ones. 

For example, water can pass through and fill a sponge and inflate it in parts where there is water. 

But the sponge cannot inflate itself or take whatever shape it wants. 

This is why speed in our physical reality is limited to 300,000 kilometers per second. It is because the crude physical waves are unable to breach that subtle limitation. 

Spacetime is shaped by the aether just as a sponge is shaped by the water that fills it. 

Huge amounts of energy is not needed to breach the physical barrier. Subtletly of the aether is needed. 


## The Purpose of Existence and Physicality

The purpose of existence is to go back to disturbance-less existence by getting a flat wave. This means finding the flatness from all the disturbance.

Our experience of reality is a small portion of all the disturbances in the aether. Physical reality is a crudified version of this aether. 

The distubances are caused by 2 Forces of Positive and Negative. 

Free will and spirit are concepts associated with the Positive. 

Determinism and force are concepts associated with the Negative.

Life is an effect of the Positive Force and is real. It is physical reality that is an illusion. 


## Consciousness

Both existence and the abstract minds that perceive existence are made up of the aether.

A mind has a hole, called consciousness, which allows the perceptions of existence to pass through. 

The flow of these perceptions changes the mind. Crude perceptions cause the mind to constrict. This reduces consciousness. 

Subtle perceptions cause the mind to dilate. This expands consciousness. 

Savikalpa samadhi is when consciousness becomes as large as the abstract local universe.  

Nirvikalpa samadhi is when consciousness becomes as large as abstract existence. 

At such expanded states, the stretched mind can no longer maintain its constricted identity. And so it breaks and melts into existence.
