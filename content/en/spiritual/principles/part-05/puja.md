Last week was my first time to attend Buddhist puja in English. Before then, the puja that I attended have been in Mandarin, Japanese, or Vietnamese. 

Chanting in English made me realize how some chants are shallow while others are deep. 

Before the puja, there was a lecture by a Thai monk about the Kalama Sutra. It basically tells people to test their own beliefs instead of blindly following them. It was used by the Buddha to remove the dogmatic parts of the Vedas. But it can now be applied to political religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

Before the puja, there was a lecture by a Thai monk about the Kalama Sutra. It basically tells people to test their own beliefs instead of blindly following them. It was used by the Buddha to remove the dogmatic parts of the Vedas. But it can now be applied to political religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

The whole reason for those political religions was the difficulty to keep peace and order in the Middle East. The Jewish solution was to impose an eye-for-an-eye rule (Exodus 21:23â€“27). Such a rule is backward and creates a vicious cycle. So Jesus gave a new rule to forgive seventy times seven (Matthew 18:22). The Prophet Mohammad softened the Jewish rule by saying that it is totally forgiveable (Sura 5:45).
