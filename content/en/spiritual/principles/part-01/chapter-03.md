The Law of Attraction is based on the principle of positive thinking which is then based on like attracting like. 

It's the same principle behind Christianity where people think of a Savior in order for their minds to become positive and help them deal with whatever problem or desire. That's why it takes root easily in the West where self interest is common. 

The problem is positive thinking is just a qualitative change in frequency like 110 volts to 220. It still needs quantitative increase in amps. It means you do the visualization ON TOP of your old effort to reach your goals. 

Usually its practictioners REDUCE their effort after changing their polarity. This causes their positivity to lack power and have more failure than if they had not adopted positivity.

Thats why action is very important in either the Law of Attractiion and Christianity.
