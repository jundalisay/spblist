Vedic Philosophy solves the infinite regression by splitting God into 2 concepts: Nirguna Brahma and Saguna Brahma. 

Superphysics translates the Nirguna as the Absolute Entity, and Saguna as the Supreme Entity. 

So the programmer and code is the Absolute. At that point there is no Existence, and the Absolute is in Pre-Existence.  

The code is deployed by the Absolute turning into the Supreme server and browsers from Itself. At that point, Existence is generated. Nature then maintains that Existence as the mechanical part of the Supreme. 

The concept of time exists only in Existence and not in Pre-Existence. 

Samadhi is when the browser matches the code of the server and becomes a server itself. 

I made a video of the 3 modes of space and time within reality: https://youtu.be/X_P0GEu4HQY
