What is Supereconomics?
{{< /r >}}

<!-- - Socrates' True Nature and Law of Social Cycles
- Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations which is derived from David Hume's Labour Theory of Value
- Vedic Varnashrama system -->
{{< l a="Supereconomics" >}}
It's the implementation of Superphysics for economics. It's based on the 4 Laws of Value which we derived from the 4 Laws of Thermodynamics. 

Basically, we equate energy with the desire to supply and demand goods and services. In this way, a supereconomy can run continuously without overheating or stalling without any blockages from inequality or deficiencies form poverty.

Instead of being split into macro and micro, it is divided into:
1. Demand (Minimum Needs)
2. Capital (Productivity)
3. Industry (Balance)
4. Trade (Distribution)

<!--  unified under the 4 Supersociology classes of Worker, Warrior, Thinker, Trader, as the division of labor The goal of Supereconomics is to harmonize the supply with demand in real time globally so that the problems of lack can be made obsolete. This can be only made possible if the wave-nature of societies is understood -->

How Does Minimum Needs Work?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Supereconomics" >}}
It's based on the Supersociology definition of a society as a single metaphysical organism. Basically, everyone is important and so their minimum needs must be met.

Is it a welfare state? What about the lazy and stupid people that don't want to work? 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Supereconomics" >}}
You can say its an "exchange" state. Everyone can do something and so the supereconomy will provide for them if they can provide some service in return. 

Our main innovation is that money is not the only way to exchange. Instead, we use barter credits where people can pay in money or in goods or services. This eliminates the time value of money for moneyless transactions so that the economy can run even without money. 

This is because we split the tool of trade from the store of value. 
- Our cards and apps are the tool
- Rice and wheat are the stores of value

<!-- The 4 Classes is useful in classifying the kinds of labor in a society which needs a balance:
- Workers: These actually create goods and services, including factories, farms, fisheries, mining, etc
- Warriors: These are the government, military, police, security, and leaders
- Thinkers: These are the education sector, research, religions, authors, media, experts
- Traders: These are the businessmen, logistics, finance, retail, wholesale

Taxation becomes fairer and more effective because taxes are based on the kind of labor. The government can then adjust the labor of society instead of having an income tax that only distinguishes on income bracket.  -->
<!-- It's based on cause, as one's dharma, instead of effect, or money and profits. What's dharma? Isn't that a religious thing? Dharma is the inherent, metaphysical nature of an identity. 

In economics, this means that you do what you were meant to do in this life. By focusing on what you were meant to do then you get revenue from society from the benefits that it gets from everyone doing what they were meant to do. No the system will tax the kinds of products that they make. This is already done by excise taxes for example. Can you give an example? How can you help me know what I'm supposed to do? -->

What about trade? How can barter be used for capital?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Supereconomics" >}}
Investors can give their machines, equipment, property, etc in exchange for a supply of products from the company that they will invest in. They can then consign those to a retailer for a stream of cash, or use or sell them themselves. 

In this way, the company doesn't need to have so much cash just to get started. Cash will really be more for operations instead of capital expenses.

What about industry? If there are so many producers, then products and services flood the market and prices go down. 
{{< /r >}}

<!-- By knowing what you like to do, what subjects you exel in, what your family does, what your vision for yourself is, etc. 

The job of the supereconomic system is to use the visible hand so that the invisible hand (Tao) can flow and work naturally to maintain and improve society. In the economic system, we can get filthy rich and have a lot of nice things. How can your system be better? -->

{{< l a="Supereconomics" >}}
The tool of trade gets information of the supply and demand in realtime. This lets the companies and the government know the actual supply and demand, as well as forecasts. For offline cards, the "points banker" will get the data.
