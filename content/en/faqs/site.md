Why are there so many unfinished pages or content that look like draft?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
We're really short of manpower, yet we have so much content to upload. So we just put up the titles and a few draft paragraphs for SEO (Google) to catch. Then we see which pages or articles get views. Then we work on those. 

So if you see a messy page, then it means very few people have viewed it or was not picked up by SEO.

Why are there broken links?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Sometimes, we find a better arrangement for the content and we transfer them or merge them with others. This is common during breaking changes.

How environmentally-friendly is your website?

We to reduce the size of our images to under 100kb and avoid React. We will try to optimize the Tailwind CSS load in the future. For now most of our pages are `B` or `A` rating in websitecarbon.com: https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/superphysics-org-social-cycles-russia/

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
I want you to explain a certain phenomenon using your Superphysics, or simplify a scientific work of a 16th century author. 

Or I want to validate whether a claim or idea by an inventor, such as a Star Trek style replicator that disassembles and reassembles atoms, will be possible in Superphysics. 

How can I do that?
