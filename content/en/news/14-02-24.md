I started publishing my personal research papers on [Wordpress](https://socioecons.wordpress.com/) after failing to get them published in Economics journals. 

Wordpress has more features than Tumbler and certainly looks better than Blogger. 

I could make a website on Github Pages or on Python Flask, but I'm too busy to focus on either.

Feb 24 | I was planning to call my proposed economic science, based on Adam Smith, as "Socionomics" but [it was already taken](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/socionomics.asp). "Smithonomics" would be too limiting and dogmatic. So I chose a temporary name as 'Socio-economics'.
