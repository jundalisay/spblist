We will be switching our websites and webapps into Sveltekit as we transition to serverless javascript. 

Curerntly we use Hugo for our websites because that was mature back in 2020 during the pandemic when we had time to move from Wordpress.com and Medium.com into Hugo:

Year | Framework
--- | ---
2011 | Wordpress.com
2019 | Medium.com
2020 | Hugo


The hot reloading of Sveltekit is faster than Hugo.

The compiling is also faster because the search mechanism is better. 

More importantly, switching to Sveltekit makes us focus on only one language: Typescript. 

So this reduces the languages that we have to know from 4 to 3:

Use | 2020 | 2024
--- | --- | ---
Webapp | Elixir (Phoenix) | Typescript (Sveltekit)
Website | Go (Hugo) | Typescript (Sveltekit)
Machine Learning | Python | Python (Streamlit)
Mobile | Dart (Flutter) | Dart (Flutter)
