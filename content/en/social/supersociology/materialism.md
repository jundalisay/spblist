In our previous post on the precirisis years, we pointed the cause to the French Revolution as the rise of materialism.

We see that freedom and materialism goes hand in hand. This is coroborated by Spinoza who also found the link between democracy and individual greed. 

from here we can metaphysical forensics of hte Ueropean society-organism.

The materialism of Romans that destroyed the Western Roman Empire continued in a muted form in Venice where it was confiend by the barbarsim of the rest of Europe and the Arab nations East and South of it. 

This Wetern materialism was latent in Spain which was under Arab rule. THe Arabs broiught it Persian learning and systems of governance. The Islamic influence was weak, the Spanish was able to use their own morals to the governence and science. Instead of using government and science to spread bortherhood, peace, Islamic law, and trade, the Spanish used it to spread Roman Catholicism and bring in gold. This is because the Arabs were a trading nation and not a manufacturing one. In fact, the Prophet Mohammad was a merchant and not a carpenter like Jesus or a shipbuilder like Noah. This is understandable since there are few trees and even  agriculture in a desert. The main core competency of the Arabs in the deserst would be logistics and navigation. This is seen in their caravans and astronomy 

The logistics and naviation were exactly the things for exploring the vast desert of blue oceans that separated Europe from the rest of the world. 


In Material Superphysics, we exposed the many errors of Physics to the supremacy of matter and the materialist mindset. 

These errors extend to sociology through 2 prevalent materialist philosophies:

1. Capitalism

This is based on money which was based on material gold and silver, which is used to force changes in economies through buying and selling. 

2. Communism

This is based on dialectical materialism where material strength is used to force changes in society.

These 2 philosophies fight each other:
- Capitalism uses material wealth to create the changes that wealthy people want to happen 
- Communism uses material force to create the changes that forceful people want to happen

These have caused a lot of conflict and suffering since matter is naturally crude, unthinking, and is therefore dominated by mere chance (which is decided by the immaterial aether). A simple proof is the conflict between the Capitalist West and ex-Communist Russia:
- The West imposed financial wealth sanctions to make Russia change its offensive actions
- Russia uses physical bombs and tanks to make Ukraine change into surrender

We show examples of how principles in one science is connected, and manifests, in another. In this case, the materialist principles manifest both in physics and politics/economics" >}}
