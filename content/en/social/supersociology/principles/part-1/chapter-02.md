Culture is the expression of the society-organism just as personality is the expression of the individual soul. 

{{< img src="/photos/countries/vn/fan.jpg" alt="Vietnamese culture" >}}

This expression includes:
- language
- clothing
- food preparation 
- music, song, and dance
- manners and traditions
- festivals 
- religion


### Culture Shock

Not all culture is dharmic. Some means of expression are based on the lower mind. Examples are:

- headhunting by some native tribes
- the oppression of women by some Middle Eastern cultures
- the emphasis of materialism by some Western societies
- the religious dogma of some Hindu sects 

These lead to shocking cultural practices just as some people have personality disorder and have strange erratic personalities.  

<!-- Culture is the collective form of all the expressions of life.
- Culture is the expression of the intellectual stratum 
 Civilization is the expression of the physical aspects of life. -->
