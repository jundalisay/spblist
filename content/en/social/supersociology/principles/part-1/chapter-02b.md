Cartesian Relationality explains the dynamics between the connection between 2 or more entities. 

In Material Superphysics, this explains their movement relative to each other.  

In Social Superphysics, this explains the movement of ideas between 2 or more entities through different media.

Here we explain relationality on the media of language.   

To explain the relationality of language, we have to explain how relationality is used by the mind to connect ideas into compound ideas whch are then used to express feelings. 


### Relational Language Model: Nodes and Connectors

Each sentence or line of thinking is based on a central idea which are connected to other ideas through their actions:

- Actioner or Actionee
  - Description of Actioner or Actionee as adjective 
- Action
  - Description of Action as adverb 

The descriptions wrap around the main actioner or action:

The most common action is the act of existing. In the English language this is notated by the word 'to be', as 'is', 'are', 'was', 'were', etc. 

For example, the sentence 'John is good' is made up of the following components: 
- John is the actioner
- is is the action
- good is the description of John

### Universal Language: Lish

This model is the basis of our proposed universal language called Lish which has the following features:
- It is syllabic like Sanskrit and English, as opposed to being tonal like Chinese
- It uses prefixes, suffixes, and onomatopoeia 


#### Onomatopoeia 

Naming things based on their sounds is done by languages:

- fuwa fuwa in Japanese 
- con meo in Vietnamese
- bang in English

We can transform the words using their sound. This will make it intuitive and easy to understand for all nations.  

For example, we can use the word "pak" to replace "hit". This is because the sound 'pak' is made when things hit others. 

In this way, the sentence `John hit Tom` changes to `John pak Tom`.


#### Suffixes

Languages such as English use prefixes and suffixes to modify words. We can use the following suffixes to modify the temporal aspect of verbs. 

Tense | Suffix
--- | ---
Past | -a
Past Emphasis or Participle (had) | -aya 
Present | -i
Currently (-ing) | -iyi 
Future | -oo
Future Recurring | -oyo

Modifiers | Suffix | Example
--- | --- | ---
Very | -hoo | 
Not | -ni | John wa-ni-hoo (John is not very handsome)



In this way, the sentence `John pak Tom` changes to `John paka Tom` i.e. John hit tom in the past. 

This can be modified into the following:

English | Lish
--- | ---
John is hitting Tom | John pakiyi Tom
John will hit Tom | John pakoo Tom


#### Honorifics

English modifies names by adding titles. However, their use is somewhat inconsistent. 

For example:
- In English, 'sir' is added to the front of a name, while the suffix Junior is added to the end.
- In Hindi, 'Shri' is added to the front, while -ji is added to the end

We nake it consistent by using suffixes. 


Name modifier | Suffix
--- | ---
Respectable | -ai
Demoting | -ow 

This converts `John pakiyi Tom` to `John-ai pakiyi Tom-ow` i.e. John (a respectable or older or higher ranked person) is hitting John (a lower ranked or younger person).


These standardize the means of expression within the human species. 


### Vocabulary
