The Thinkers emerge from the Warriors as the enlightened leaders. These are able to secure the society for the next cycles. 

These manifest as priests, sages, shamans, researchers, intellectuals. 

The emergence of thinkers means that the warriors have succeeded in securing the basic existence of the society. 


The Thinker Cycle is the 3rd cycle of a society.
