India stayed vbegetyarian, focusing on beans and lentils like back gram and dal.

China focused on soybeans as soy milk and tofu, as proven by Mapo tofu.

- the violent wars done by Europeans, often using destructive weapons such as firearms, gunpowder, artillery, and nukes 

In Asia, such destructive weapons were only used by the Mongols who pioneered the use of gunpowder and dead bodies to breed disease on their enemies.
