At the 100th day of the Gaza war, Muslims are asking: Where is 'Allah'?

{{< youtube Pqi5REE9XEw >}}


<!-- The feud between Jews and Arabs have been going on for centuries. Yet it was  -->


The Prophet Mohammad united the Arabs first against the Persians, and then against the Byzantines. 

Their uniting factor was the idea of Allah which was on top of a new set of laws in the Quran that imposed on every aspect of life, from diet, dress and worship, to civil code, war, and taxation.

This was very different in Europe where different people served as the foundation for the laws:
- Montesquieu wrote about political law
- Grotius wrote about the laws on war
- Adam Smith wrote about economic laws


These 2 factors of Allah and Law allowed the Arabs to win against their enemies, even during the crusades of the 13th century.

From a shallow perspective, such victories might be seen as proof that the Islamic formula for victory is effective -- submit to the Quran blindly without asking questions and you will get all the rewards promised in it.

However, this is contradicted by the fact that the Arabs and Persians were defeated afterwards by the Mongols in the Siege of Baghdad in 1258. 

- The Mongols themselves were defeated by the Ming Chinese in 1368
- The Chinese were then defeated by the British in the Opium War in 1851
- The British were defeated by the Americans in the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. 


### Mesopotamia and the Middle East

According to our Anunnaki Hypothesis, human civilization began in the Middle East through the genetic engineering done by the Anunnaki on Homo Erectus. This produced Homo Sapiens. 

{{< youtube sxq8vIm4Cwc >}} 

Middle Eastern society will have traces of that Annunaki vibration, which is permeates the oversoul of the Arab and Jewish people. 

<!-- From the perspective of physical victories and prosperity, we can say that 'Allah' is the oversoul of the Arab-Persian people, as realized by the Prophet and Islamic scholars.  -->

The Mongol-Chinese and the British-Americans have their own oversoul which initiates projects and consequently the possibility of victory or defeat.

Using the Anunnaki Hypothesis, we can rename the Western 'God' as Enlil and 'Allah' as Enki. 

The dominance between Enki and Enlil shifts back anbd forth over millennia. 
- In the pre-Atlantean times, Enlil was dominant 
- In the Atlantean times, Enki was dominant 
- In the post-Atlantean times, Enlil was again dominant 

Currently, this dominance rests with the Americans, as the descendants of the Roman oversoul via Britain which was colonized by Rome. 

Rome did have a weak period from the 400s AD to the 14th century when they were nearly overrun by the Mongol oversoul. But it reconstituted itself through the Spanish and British Empires which colonized the world.  

<!-- If we rename this oversoul as 'God', and the Persian-Arabian oversoul as 'Allah', then it means that the US is the new 'God' in town, as the superpower for the 20th century.  -->

<!-- So the US is the new 'God' in town, representing the American oversoul.  -->

Those who submit to the American oversoul get benefits such as peace and prosperity. This is exactly what Israel did and what the Palestinians did not.

Proof is that it is only the US has the God-powers to tell Israel to stop bombing Gaza. It is also the US that gives petrodollars to Islamic Saudi Arabia to make it wealthy. 

So where is the 'Allah' that gives victory and prosperity? It is in the US. Rather, Enki has given way to Enlil.  

If people think that Allah is somehow with Saudi or Iran, then loss and suffering will make them realize their mistake them sooner or later.

The US is slowly losing ground to *Chindia* (China-India). So the next 'God' will be in Asia.

Morever, this proves that the strength of the US is not its democracy since that very democracy is causing the slow decline of its productivity and instability. 

In reality, the strength of the US is from its huge productive land that is safe from the invaders from Europe, Africa, and Asia, just as Britain's strength was its geographical separation from European armies while gaining European ideas and systems. Britain gained all the advantages of Europe without its disadvantages. 



Chindia's strength, in contrast, will be its sheer population size, a population that will necessarily produce great leaders and geniuses within its huge mass. Assuming that a population of 1 million will have 1 genius, then Chindia's population of nearly 3 billion will have nearly 3,000 geniuses. The US will only have 300 native geniuses, the rest are currently imported from Chindia such as its Indian CEOs.     


Here, we organize the strengths of the different 'Gods':


God or Oversoul | Power Source (Social Cycle)
--- | ---
Egyptians | Agriculture (Worker)
Greeks | Science (Thinker)
Romans | Military Organization (Warrior)
Arab-Persians | Religious Fervor (Thinker)
Mongols | Horses (Warrior)
Ming | Political Skill (Thinker)
British | Mercantile Fervor (Trader)
Americans | Land and Mercantile Fervor (Trader)
Chindia | Population (Worker)

<!-- Military Organization (Warrior) -->

This post aims to give the concept that the main mechanism that powers Judeo-Christian religions is positive thinking. This includes cultural affinities. 

The Quran gives many promises in exchange for obedience that is in line with Arab culture. An example is the difference between men and women. 

Since mentality creates reality, then those promises are sometimes kept. This manifests as Muslim countries being rich in oil or natural resources.

The defeat of the US in the Vietnam War is an example of the higher degree of positivity of Ho Chi Minh versus Nixon or Ngo.

If 2 Gods fight each other, such as in the Crusades, and both have the same positive thinking, **then the deciding factor becomes the social cycle**. 

For example, the mercantile Seljuks naturally defeated the religious Crusaders just as oligarchs naturally defeat philosophers.  

If both sides have the same social cycle, then the deciding factor is their **mastery of the 5 Elements**. This usually manifests as their technological superiority.

The Taliban are technological inferior to the US yet were able to win because of their cultural affinity with the Afghan people.
