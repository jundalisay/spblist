Morality manifests as honesty and integrity which are both free yet expensive. 

It is free because it costs nothing to be honest. Yet it is very expensive because a lie can cost a lot of monetary and practical loss. For example, a divorce can be very expensive and begins with a lie that the man and woman want to live together until they die. A cheaper version of this is a breakup of a boyfriend or girlfriend as it is a lesser form of the lie of wanting to live together. 
Likewise, a defective product is based on a lie when the product does not do what it is advertised to do. 

It causes a loss if the product cannot be refunded. Lies are also very common in cryptocurrency scams and has created a loss of over $1.7 b in 2018 alone.

To discourage lies, we build morality by creating a social network with likes-dislikes and sentiment analysis, through SORA Match, which will be processed by machine learning to reveal objective information about the morality in people. 

The more honest a person, the more likely he will be a good supplier or customer, or a borrower or renter that can make timely payments.

In time, the system will learn the morality in a network so that it can bypass the tool called money, and instead use a system of non-monetary debts and credits in real time to circulate goods and services.
