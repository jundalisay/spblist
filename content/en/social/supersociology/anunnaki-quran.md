The war in Lebanon and the destruction of Gaza prove the strength of Israel over Islam. This is totally different from the weakness of the Jews during the Islamic conquest. 

To explain this, we trace the history of the Middle East from the Islamic times back to the Sumerian. Many histories go back only to the Jewish texts which began after the Jews left Egypt. 

By going back to the Sumerian texts, we can complete the picture of the Middle East to the dominance of the Anunnaki "gods".

These gods had 2 factions, represented by 2 brothers:

1. Enlil - he became the deity of the Greeks, Romans, and Indians
2. Enki - he became the deity of the Jews and The Muslims

Enlil's symbolism was the bull. This is why Hindus regard cows as sacred. This is also why the Minotaur was imprisoned in Crete, which was allied with Enki. 

So we use Enki to replace:
- Allah in the Quran through the [Anunnaki Quran](/research/mohammad/quran/sura-002a/)
- Yahweh in the Old Testament, as the [Anunnaki Old Testament](/research/ancient/jewish)

In this way, one can read the Sumerian, Babylonian, Jewish texts, and then the Quran to find the story of the Middle Eastern people consistent. 


### The Anunnaki History

<!-- While trying to update my Maharlika book, I wanted to prove that the Austronesians came from a land mass east of Taiwan that sunk. But the only information that I could find was about Atlantis which is on the other side of the globe. 

So I ended up looking into Atlantis instead, based on the Sumerian texts.  -->

500,000 years ago an alien race called the Annunaki went to Earth to mine gold. This was because their planet had severe global warming. 

Gold is a great heat sink, non-toxic (can be eaten), and very malleable. It keeps its reflective and heat properties even when atomized, making it a great heat shield when dumped into the stratosphere.

So they set up a base called Nibiru near Jupiter where they collect the gold from our solar system.

Their leader was Enlil. The second in command was his younger brother Enki. 

On Earth, they find that mining is difficult so they add their genes to Homo Erectus to create humans to help them mine the gold. 

This explains why only humans are the advanced species on Earth and why humans have a strange obsession with precious metals. 

It is common to see animals fight for food. But humans are strange because they fight for gold and wealth and even sacrifice their lives for it. The Spanish, for example, searched the world for gold and silver -- this proves that the genetic programming done by Annunaki still persists. 


### Noah and the Atlantean Humans

Enki goes further and adds intelligence to a batch of humans. This is discovered by Enlil who is angered because humans are supposed to be slaves. Adding intelligence would likely make them independent. 

The intelligent batch of humans create the city of Atlantis in the Bahamas, which soon rivals the original cities in Mesopotamia and Egypt established by Enlil. 

True enough, the Atlanteans, allied with Enki, began waging war against the civilizations allied with Enki in order to conquer the world and transfer the leadership to Enki.    

As defence, the female Annunaki general Athena (allied with Enlil) establishes Athens as a city-fort against Crete which was a vassal to Atlantis. Strategically, it could also defend Egypt and Mesopotamia. 

The height of the war began during 11,000 BC. Realizing that humans were now intelligent, Enki and the Annunaki Council decided to abandon the gold-mining project and destroy all humans by diverting a comet onto Atlantis.

This sank Atlantis and created a huge flood. 

But Enki warned the Atlanteans about it, ordering Noah to build an ark.

After the flood, a few Annunaki of the Enki faction felt sad for the humans that they had created, and so they stayed behind and taught agriculture to the remaining humans. 

They died out naturally, allowing humans to rule the Earth. 

The last ones though, helped the Jews, who were always allied with Enki, escape from Egypt which was allied with Enlil.

The Anunnaki remotely connect to Prophet Mohammad, as Allah, in order to remind the Arabs and their Jewish brothers about their covenant. 

Allah tells Mohammad to defeat the Romans (which were allied with Enlil) who earlier defeated the Jews and destroyed the Temple.

Since the US is descended from the Roman Empire via Britain, this 13,000 year conflict continues to this day as the animosity between the Arabs and the West.  


### Why Israel is Dominating the Arabs

According to this Anunnaki history, the Jews and Arabs are in the same Enki faction going against the West which was allied with Enlil. So why are they fighting each other?  

<!-- But Enlil was the proper leader of the Anunnaki on Earth. This is why he is naturally superior to Enki.  -->

This is because the Jews sided with the West starting from the 20th century, thanks to their dominance of the financial industry. This matched the switch of the West towards banking and finance.  

The Arabs on the other hand stayed with the commerce of natural resources, such as oil and natural gas. This made them naturally weaker from the 20th century, different from the times of the Crusades when they were superior to the West and the Jews.
