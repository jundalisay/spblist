The Russia-Ukraine war is now on its second year, creating nearly the worst reality after a year of conflict.


{{< img src="/photos/countries/ua/war.jpg" alt="Russian Invasion" >}}


The best reality in 2022 would have been for the Ukranian President to flee in February, allowing Russia to control all of Ukraine. This would have prevented:
- the massive deaths, casualties, and destruction in Ukraine
- the loss of soldiers on both sides
- the massacre at Bucha and other places
- the Ukrainian [refugee crisis](https://www.timesofisrael.com/raped-abused-exploited-ukrainian-women-seeking-refuge-in-israel-find-no-haven/)
- the global [food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_food_crises) and [supply chain crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932023_global_supply_chain_crisis) 

The worst reality is for Russia to use nuclear weapons, with North Korea and even China joining in to create World War 3.

Some predict the war to [end soon](https://www.rand.org/blog/2023/01/how-the-war-in-ukraine-could-end-sooner-than-expected.html), probably even [within this year](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/21/qa-dr-pavel-felgenhauer-russia-ukraine-war). Others predict a conflict with [no foreseeable end](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63987113)

Our model clearly says that the war will go on up to a specific year when Russsia leaves its current Warrior Cycle. In fact, a long war is advantageous to Russia as the West does not seem to like long wars. This is proven by:
- the withdrawal of NATO in Afghanistan 
- the withdrawal of the US in Vietnam 


It might even merge with the coming China-Taiwan war.

The mess left behind by Western policy in Libya, Syria, and Iraq are further proofs of how a conflict can create a perpetual state of crisis.


## The Mongol Vision 

We foresee that the military aid to Ukraine will start to be questioned in the West by 2024 as it falls short of expectations*. With superior Western weapons, Ukraine might win its tactical objectives. But Russia will keep clawing its way back to mute or nullify those victories.

This has actually become true with Trump halting aid to Ukraine.

This is because Russia has the moral cause, as:
- self-preservation
- the unity of the Rus

This is similar to North Vietnam engaging in a long war against US-supported South Vietnam, winning in the long run to unify the Vietnamese. 

China will then take a more prominent role in the peace negotiations, as well as the reconstruction of Ukraine which will have its eastern part going to Russia. 

After many years, Western Ukraine gets accepted into the EU and NATO, the usual problems will arise such as:
- regulatory issues
- corruption
- exodus of Ukrainiains, and
- cultural differences

Instead of the Western mentality affecting and improving the Slavic mentality, it will be the Slavic spreading onto the Western or Roman mentality.

The greater role of China, as Confucian mentality, and the spread of Slavic culture are consequences of **the decline of Western civilzation**. We had called this "[The Mongol Vision](/social/cycles/russia)"*. The massacre at Bucha is proof of the Mongol mentality within the soul of Russian society. 


{{< f f="*The Ukrainians, as the Kievan Rus, made a fatal mistake of not surrendering to the Mongols in 1240. This led to their destruction. The Russians, on the other hand, surrendered. This allowed Russia to survive and be the leader of the Rus. Modern Ukraine had a chance to avoid the mistake that their ancestors made, only to blow that chance in 2014-2022. The root of the problem in Ukraine is that it is a fertile country in a barren neighborhood." >}}

## The Same Problem All Over Again

Our solution for both Ukraine in 2022 and Ukraine in 1240 are still the same: It should agree to peace as soon as possible.

This is because each day of delay divides the Slav mental wave as it spreads across Europe. More importantly, it will end the current food and supply chain crisis that affects most people on Earth. 


{{< img src="/graphics/social/beheading.jpg" alt="Russian beheadings" cap="Update April 16, 2023: The news about Russian soldiers beheading Ukrainian soliders is very much in line with Mongol behavior. It is useless for Zelensky to call such Russians as beasts just as the criticisms of the 13th century Europeans against the Mongols didn't change the course of history. Instead, it would be better for Zelensky to listen to the demands of Putin, overseen by Xi Jinping. Prior to the war, Putin was asking Ukraine to join the Russian customs union instead of joining the EU. That customs union would have prevented so many of the problems that the world has today, so that the world can focus better on the bigger natural problem called global warming." >}}



PBS has a good documentary on the civil war in Ukraine:

## Update March 2025: The Oval Office Argument

The strategy of Ukraine is to drag other countries into their private conflict with Russia. 

Zelensky used this in the Oval Office in March where he said that the Russian invasion is a problem of the US and that the Americans will feel the problem had it not been separated by an ocean.

Trump then correctly interjects and says "You don't know that. Don't tell us what we're gonna feel. You're in no position to dictate that. You're gambling with World War 3."

Zelensky is using a sophistical argument that Russia's invasion is somehow a part of a big plan to take over Europe and the US and that the invasion of Ukraine is just its first step. 

This is to drag other countries into defending it so that a simple problem between 2 countries becomes the problem of the  whole world. 

But this is absurd since the losses of Russia in taking the Donbass has been so huge. It would need full mobilization, and total support from China and North Korea just to be able to march to the Polish border. The Soviet Army couldn't even win in Afghanistan in 10 years. 

In reality, the Russian invasion of Ukraine is a defensive move of self-preservation to protect non-liberalism after the fall of Iraq, Libya, Gaza, Syria, and threats to Iran.

The best policy would have been for Biden to ban Ukraine from entering the EU and NATO. 

The next best policy would have been for Zelensky's government to exile itself to Poland or somehwhere in the EU. This is in case Russia decides to eradicate Ukrainian culture and language. 

This is similar to how the Dalai Lama is in exile in India to preserve Tibet's traditions after China's invasion in 1950.
