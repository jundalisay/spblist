Negative Warrior | 17 |


Coming Soon!

<!-- The goal of an impeachment is to disqualify a President from "enjoying any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States" because he did high crimes and misdemeanor. I would classify the 3 non-New York convictions as high crimes.

After he loses honor and position, then he can be grilled by whatever law: "the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law."

The main problem with Trump is that things happened temporally in reverse. He was convicted first and then gained honor and position later. In other words, he was impeached even before becoming President. That was the Democrat strategy because they knew that none of them were as popular as Trump especially since their wars (to keep the world stable) have made Democrats unpopular. 

So by saying he can pardon himself means that the entire justice system (police investigation, due process, jury, lawyers, jurisprudence, etc) can be thrown away and bypassed if the masses vote to free a criminal every 4 years. So why have a justice system when the police can just let the people vote on whether a suspect is innocent or not (Jesus v. Barabas)?

The current Warrior mentality manifests as the belligerent attitude of Trump supporters which invaded the Capitol, as well as increased racism and police brutality. -->


<!-- Real America vs Liberal America

The American founding fathers put God as the ruler over freedom (liberalism), as proven by "In God We Trust."

Bible Belt states as the Real America. However, the  Civil war north against the South non-liberal south which preferred slavery. 

This led to God being replaced by liberalism and therefore ambition, money, and property. This led to expansionism as the Spanish-Ameican War and then entry into WWI and WWII. It will likely see-saw between liberalism (financial crisis, globalism) and noniberalism (anti-vaxxer, racism) around every 200 years or so.      -->
