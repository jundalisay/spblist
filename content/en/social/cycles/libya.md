{{< i s="/flags/ly.png" a="Libya Flag" >}}


The origins of the Libyan Civil war was connected to Arab Spring which began in Tunisia and spread to Egypt.

The biggest mistake was Qaddafi going on air and saying that he will basically kill all his enemies, including women and children. This threat made Obama act up and launch airstrikes against Qadaffi. Big mistake.

The US policy is inconsistent because while the US killed Qadaffi, it did not kill Bashar Al-Assad who already killed his own people with poison gas.

The root cause of all this was the Financial Crisis of 2008.
