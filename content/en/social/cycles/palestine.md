Palestine's social cycle is exactly 13 years (the time from the First Intifada of 1987 [Trader Cycle] to the Second Intifada of 2000 [Worker Cycle]). 

You can trace this cycle backwards in time and it will match the Arab-Israeli War of 1948 [Laborer Cycle].

Palestine is currently at the latter parts of its Warrior Cycle. This is reflected in the massive planning for Al-Aqsa flood which took some years before its actual implementation in October 2023. 

The secret to Hamas' victory of Fatah is that it can successfully match Palestine's social cycles, while Fatah and the PLO seem out of sync with it.
