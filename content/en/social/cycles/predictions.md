Tsz-chang asked: Is it possible to forecast the state of the country 10 generations from now?<br><br>Confucius: The Yin dynasty adopted the rules and manners of the Hu line of kings. It is possible to tell whether it retrograded or advanced. The Chow line has followed the Yin and adopted its ways. Whether there has been deterioration or improvement may also be determined.  Some other line may take up in turn those of Chow. If this process goes on for 100 generations, then the result may be known.

Since the 2008 from the US Presidential elections and 2013 from the Greek Debt Crisis, we've been making predictions on society and economics as an implentation of Supersociology.

## Prediction List 

Here are the results so far:

Country | Year Prediction was Made | Prediction | Outcome
--- | --- | --- | ---  
World | 2015 | A global crisis will spark in 2019 marking the start of a long crisis which we call 'The Crisis Years' | {{< color color="green" val="Correct" >}}
World | 2019 | A global financial crisis will emerge in a certain year between 2020-2030 as a result of that 2019 crisis | {{< c v="green" >}}Semi-correct, split as the US banking Crisis and the fall of cyrpto{{< /c >}}
![German flag](/flags/de.png) | 12/2024 | [BSW](/social/cycles/germany) (Left) will win more seats than AfD as a result of the Worker Cycle | {{< c v="red" >}}Wrong. This means Germany is in warrior, not worker cycle. The worker Left did get more votes than previously, but not more than the warrior parties{{< /c >}}
![US flag](/flags/us.png) | 2024 | The US will participate in a war or large battle towards the end of Trump's term | {{< c v="orange" >}}Pending{{< /c >}}
![US flag](/flags/us.png) | 2024 | Harris will win, as we estimate that the US is leaving its Warrior Cycle. In reality, Trump won, which means the US is still in the Warrior Cycle that it was in back in 2016. This necessarily leads to a World War 3 prediction above. We explain our wrong prediction [here](/social/supersociology/crisis-years/) | {{< c v="red" >}}Wrong{{< /c >}}
![Russian flag](/flags/ru.png) | 2023 | Russia will step up its offensives against Ukraine despite the lack of resources | {{< color color="green" val="Correct" >}}

![Hungary flag](/flags/hu.png) | 2022 | Hungary: Orban will win the elections | {{< color val="Correct" >}}
![Japan flag](/flags/jp.png) | 2021 | Probing prediction--Kono will be Prime Minister. In reality, Kishida won. This proves that Japanese political system is [a society within a society](/social/cycles/japan/) that represents itself and not the people, just like China's Communist party. To predict Japan's elections, the model has to be applied to the LDP | {{< color color="Navy" val="Null" >}}

![Russian flag](/flags/ru.png) | 2021 | Navalny's protests will not bear fruit and will fizzle out, while Russia will increase its militarization [This is especially true in 12/2021 with Russia amassing troops near Ukraine -- it will only get worse!] | {{< color val="Correct" >}}
![Israel flag](/flags/il.png) | 2021 | Netanyahu will lose power after 2020. | {{< color val="Correct. He lost but merely came back through his party" >}}

As you can see, there were many mistakes in the beginning. But just like any learning system, it gets better in time as the patterns of social cycles and their interaction with each other become clearer.


## Based on Recurring Social Cycles

The core of the model is based on David Hume‘s maxim that mentality creates reality. The model proposes that human society is a metaphysical entity that is made up of individual metaphysical entities called human souls or abstract minds. 

This society has its own known dynamics which is explained by the ‘Social Cycle’ model of Socrates and the ‘Moral Sentiments’ model of Adam Smith, Hume's best friend.

![David Hume](/covers/hume.jpg)

Each society’s mentality has its own cycles which clash or concur with those of others, creating the events in the news. By knowing the flow of each mentality, then the outcome of regular events or long-running events can be predicted, such as elections, conflicts, or economic recessions. This is somewhat used nowadays in Game Theory. However, instead of creating selfish actors like in game theory, we use a specific range of personality ‘types’ with their own attributes and dynamics. 

<!-- (/fallacies/economics/nash-equilibrium-fallacy) -->

These ‘types’ are generally known as varnas in Hinduism and the social classes in ancient China.

{{< box >}}
On the personal level (in Medical Superphysics), these types are the different personalities based on the chakras. This explains why some medicines work for some people but not for others. The cause for the difference is the personality types. This is why alternative medicine does not produce conclusive scientific evidence or patterns because science does not know the different personality types. Knowing these types will unlock the benefits of alternative medicine just as the social cycles unlocks the benefits of policymaking that is in line with the changes in society, since prevention is better than cure. 

For example, Ukraine already knew the aggressiveness of Russia from 2014-2019 in the Donbass, even if Russia was still in a Worker Cycle. This should have warned them to surrender when threatened by Russia in 2022 when they enetered their Warrior cycle.

Historical events are used as ‘markers’ for plotting the flow of this mentality, which can be used as training data for Artificial Intelligence to better crunch all events together to form more accurate mentalities and therefore predictions.


## Social Years, Months, Weeks, Days

A social day is around 12-20 earth-years (revolution around the sun).

A week is 4 days.

A month is 4 weeks.

A year is 4 months.

This gives us the following ranges:

Timespan | Min | Max
--- | --- |---
Day | 12 | 20
Week | 48 | 80
Month | 192 | 320
Year | 768 | 1280

For example:
- Israel is currently in the 5th year from the start of their society which began around 1300's BC as their exodus from Egypt.
- Russia is on the 5th week from the start of the Russian Empire of Catherine the Great.
- The Philippines is on the 2nd month as Westernized Maharlika


## Some Countries are Easy to Predict, Some are Difficult

It's easy to make accurate predictions for the USA because there is a lot of consistent, historical data from its inception in 1776 up to today. However, it's difficult to make predictions for:
- Middle Eastern countries like Syria and Iraq as they were bunched up together under the Ottoman Empire for many years
- countries whose histories are not in English, such as Vietnam and Thailand
- countries that have so much historical information such as China and India. This increases the noise which prevents accurate modelling. The Europeans fixed this problem when enlightened writers weeded out the noise or inferior historians
