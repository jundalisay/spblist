Vietnam saved Cambodia from the mistake of the US, but the US only did what it did because Vietnam did not give up.

Adam Smith wrote about South Vietnam in his book The Wealth of Nations: in 1779 proving the natural wealth of Vietnam: 
“Most of the cultivated lands in South Vietnam produce corn and rice, the food of the people there. The prices of corn, rice, and sugar, are there probably in the natural proportion. Their prices compensate the landlord and farmer according to the original expence of improvement and annual cultivation.”

However, this wealth is what naturally attracted the French merchants. China and Vietnam were resource-rich but did not have a consumer market so they didn’t have a need for European goods that were supposed to buy the Chinese tea and Vietnamese sugar. 

So instead, the British mercantile company traded opium to China while the French mercantile company traded opium to Vietnam.

In China, this led to the opium war and the loss of Hongkong in 1898. It made the people weak that they became easy followers for Communism which was formed in China in 1921. In Vietnam, it was formed in 1925 by Ho Chi Minh.

Because of World War II, France grew weaker and the US would’ve naturally slowly filled their shoes in Vietnam after the Geneva Conference of 1954. However, the French made a stupid strategy in Diem Bien Phu which caused their loss and Vietnam to be split in two. 

The North Vietnamese destroyed their own institutions and laws and replaced them with unproven Communist ones, similar to how Pol Pot reverted Cambodia back to the stone age. 

In a nutshell, Vietnam and China were rich, but decided to throw everything out and start from zero. China only really started in the 1980’s with Deng’s reforms and Vietnam in 1986 with Doi Moi.
