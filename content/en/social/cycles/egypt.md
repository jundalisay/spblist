The Arab Spring shows a Worker cycle.



<!-- The "lack of direction" is a sign of the Laborer cycle, as Laborers desire social justice over strong, decisive action. The "turn" already happened in 2011 when Mubarak was ousted, and another "turn" will happen in around 20 years. Syria's case is different--its Warrior cycle (led by Assad) was prematurely challenged by Sunni rebels (Intellectuals fighting for dogma). Had the rebels waited for another 10 years, Assad's regime would have naturally weakened and a Civil war avoided.

in the middle of which arises the desire in the Laborer minds for strong leaders who can give direction, eventually leading to a Warrior cycle.
