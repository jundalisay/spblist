Israel is the easiest country to plot because its history has been recorded by both the Romans and Arabs.

It is currently in the of the 3rd day of the 2nd week of the 2nd month of the 5th year that began with Moses and the exodus from Egypt.

### The Gaza War

Hamas attacked Israel in Operation Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7, 2023. It came as a shock that they could penetrate so easily into Israel and kill so many innocent people. 

It was a huge blow against Israeli ego, and so they respond totally disproportionately by invading Gaza and killing so many Palestinians in revenge. 

Netanyahu sophistically says that their invasion has the same moral grounds as the US avenging Pearl Harbor or 9/11. This is wrong because:

- The US only bombed Japan indiscriminately because all of Japan pledged allegiance to their Emperor. Not all Palestinians are allied with Hamas
- The US did not bomb Afghanistan indiscriminately. Instead, they took a lot of pains to operate close to the civilian populations to avoid collateral damage. This is why a lot of US soldiers died. 


## How the Jews Took Arab Lands

Superphysics solutions work by striking at the root of the problem. The problem in Palestine began when Israel invaded and took the land for themselves. 

They couldn't do this in ancient times when military strength was manual, through spears and swords, and not through machines like the machine gun. 

This was because the population of the Israeli tribes was small compared to the Arabs, Persians, Romans, Babylonians, etc and so they were constantly defeated and expelled from Israel.

The industrial revolution allowed machines to replace manual work. This helped the Europeans conquer the world until they realized that even conquest was a lot of work. And so they retreated back to Europe, leaving behind the European system to give them easy access to the colonial world. 

This mainly manifests as Bretton Woods institutions:
- The World Bank which represents the US
- The IMF which represents Europe 
- [The World Trade Organization](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/bretton-woods) that is the end-user of the financing from the World Bank and IMF through the various national economies

This is why the main weapons by the West against the Russian invasion of Ukraine were financial and trade sanctions. 

The Jews embraced this European system through finance and industry (machines) since their population was small and these systems helped them maximize themselves by multiplying their labor.

Moreover, their religion allowed them to charge an interest to foreigners, different from Islam which banned interest on loans.  


{{< q a="Enki" c="The Anunnaki Bible, Deuteronomy 23:19-20 (God = Enki)" >}}
Do not charge interest on your fellow Israelite for money, food, or anything that can earn interest. You may charge foreigners interest. But you must not charge interest on your brother Israelite so that Enki may bless you in all that you do in the land you are entering to possess.
{{< /q >}}



Their power consequently rose along with the rise of industry and finance. 


In Social Superphysics, finance is a quality of the Trading Class, as opposed to the military which is a quality of the Warrior class. 

The Trading class started growing in Europe from the 17th century. By the 20th century, they were stronger than the Warrior class, as proven by the defeat of Warrior Germany in WWI and WWII.   

Hitler knew the threat from the Trading class. This is why he tried to isolate the Jews:

 <!-- to prevent their rise, eventually losing during World War II.  -->

{{< q a="Hitler" c="Mein Kampf, The Problem Of The Trade Unions" >}}
The Marxists created the economic weapon which the international Jew uses for the purpose of destroying the economic foundations of free and independent national States, for ruining their national industry and trade and thereby enslaving free nations to serve Jewish world-finance, which transcends all State boundaries.
{{< /q >}}


The rise of the Jewish power, as an effect of the dominance of the Trading Class, allowed the Jews to set foot in Israel, something that could not between the 4th and 16th centuries when the Warrior and Thinking Classes were superior. 


### Why Did The Arabs Get Weak?

The Arabs were strong during their Islamic Conquest when they had a Thinker Revolution thanks to Islam. This extended during their Trader Cycle when they expanded to Indonesia through trade instead of conquest. They then became irrelevant when they entered their Worker Cycle. 


While the Jews focused on finance and industry, the Arabs focused on oil. This is a sign of a Worker Mentality similar to that in Banana Republics. 


The problem is that oil is a mere commodity and does not multiply labor nor productivity. It gives energy, but what good is that energy without machines?

> While the Jews focused on finance and industry, the Arabs focused on oil

In a war using machines, productivity is important as it gives the vehicles, weapons, ammunition, and supplies needed by the military.

Arab productivity was far less than that of the Jewish power which was based on the financial industry*. And so, Isreal could buy the expensive modern weapons that let them gain more Palestinian lands. 


{{< n n="The power of finance can be reduced by moneyless systems." >}}
 

## The Solution: One State

The productivity of the Israelis allowed them to defeat the low-productivity Arabs and create the state of Israel, occupying the lands of the state of Palestine. 

The solution of the world was a shallow Two-State solution wherein Israel and Palestine would have their own territories, government, miltary, educational system, etc. 

But this doesn't work because Palestinian productivity is nowhere close to that of Israel. And so Israel still lords over Palestine. 

The best and only real solution is to unify the 2 states into a single state of Israel where both peoples will have equal rights. 


### A Key Solution: A Unified Book as the Anunnaki Torah-Quran

The problem between the Jews and Arabs spring from the opposing ideas that have been programmed to them by their foundational books:
- The Torah
- The Quran

For example. the Torah allows interest, but the Quran bans it. 

To unify both books, we use our [Anunnaki Hypothesis](/bio/solutions/anunnaki). This states that humans were created by the alien Anunnaki to mine gold. They set up shop in the Middle East where there is a lot of oil so that the ore can be processed there. 

Their leader was Enlil and their 2nd in command was Enki. It was Enki who genetically engineered humans from homo erectus and is therefore the Creator of man.

Enlil got upsed with the early humans and so he left Earth after destroying them in a flood in 10,800 BC. 

Enki, however, had an attachment to his creations so he stayed behind and guided them through their evolution, as God in the Bible and Allah in the Quran.


{{< i s="/photos/medieval/anu.jpg" a="Enki likes to be worshipped" c="Enki likes to be worshipped A LOT" >}}


Our solution is to unify the Old Testament and the Quran by replacing 'God' and 'Allah' with 'Enki', as the Anunnaki [Torah](/research/ancient/jewish/old-testament/genesis/chapter-02)-[Quran](/research/mohammad/quran/sura-002a)

This will make Genesis up to Surat-an-Nas of the Quran more logical since it is seen from the perspective of Enki. 


<!-- These opposing ideas and feelings exist in the metaphysical domain of the abstract mind or soul and obviously have take hostage of the Jewish and Arab souls, to the point that they sacrifice their physical lives for those metaphysical ideas and feelings.

Although the Israel-Palestine conflict manifests as a physical land-grab problem, it is first a metaphysical conflict arising from the difficulties of physical desert life. 

Why are their ideas so contrary?

Before the invention of printing, the principles of society were not so well known. Society was glued by arbitrary laws made by strong personalities. For example, the Jews had their own laws in the Torah, just as the Muslims had their own laws in the Quran. 

Laws are just encapsulations of the feelings of the leaders at the time when they were created. So those laws are really the feelings of those leaders. 

Printing allowed people to express their feelings and make policy suggestions. This led to the representative form of lawmaking. --> 


### Has the Promise of Self-Preservation Baked In

<!-- The key solution to the conflict is to make a new book that has both the feelings of the Torah and the Quran. We will call it as the "Unified Book". -->

This Anunnaki Torah-Quran will have the important principles in both Judaism and Islam such as submission, civil law, Judgement Day, etc.  

More importantly, it will guarantee the mutual-preservation of the Jewish and Palestinian races. This is because it is easy to notice that self-preservation is the common theme with:
- the Anunnaki
- Judaism
- Islam
- Nazism 

These see their own race or belief system as so superior to others, killing those other races that threatened them:
- Enlil killed the humans that he didn't like
- Moses ordered the Levites to kill fellow Jews 
- The Prophet Mohammad ordered the killing of the Banu Qurayza
- Nazism killed many Jews during the Holocaust


This superiority comes from a natural **negative coping mechanism** in a **negative environment**:
- The Anunnaki went to Earth because their planet was in danger
- The Jews were refugees and were later destroyed many times by other kingdoms
- Islam had to fight tooth and nail during its conquest, fighting giants as the Eastern Romans and the Persians
- Nazism began from the German defeat in World War II


The Anunnaki "Toran" (Torah-Quran) will not be a religious, but rather a moral, philosophical, and historical one. Below is the proposed schedule for such changes which goes with the cycles of Israel. 


Phase: Year | Policy 
--- | ---
Phase 1: 2024 | Sanctions are placed on Israel for crimes against humanity until One State Solution is ratified. Work on the new Constitution, as well as the Anunnaki Toran begins.
Phase 2: 2036 | The Constitution and the Anunnaki Toran are ratified and taught to all. 
Phase 3: 2048 | Sanctions are lifted. All historical land titles from the records of the Ottoman empire, Britain, and Jordan will be collected. Lands will be given back to descendants of owners as usufruct rights. A lot of clashes will happen at this period.   
Phase 4: 2060 | Most of the clashes will die down. The Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, etc. can gradually return.
Phase 5: 2072 | Zionism will have a mini-resurgence and cause clashes with the returning refugees.
