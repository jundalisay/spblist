Supereconomics aims to harmonize demand with supply in real time to prevent lack in society. 

Unlike Economics which prioritizes the suppliers and their profit motive, Supereconomics prioritizes the demanders and their consumption motive. 

This is why the demand model is the first to be discussed.

The demand model of Economics and Supereconomics are very similar in the sense that they are both downward-sloping.

The main difference is that the Supereconomic demand model allows real value which is pegged to food as points. 



### The Value of Rarity

We replace the Paradox of Value of Economics with the Value of Rarity of Supereconomics.

This states that the mind assigns a higher comparative value on rare items compared to common ones that are not negative or detrimental to life.

There might be rare diseases or rare disabilities. But these have a negative value as they are against the normal template of a healthy life. 

- Tall basketball players are rarer than short ones, and so they have more value. 
- Gold is rarer than iron and so it is more valuable
