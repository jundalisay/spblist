description: "Economics uses money both as a store of value and tool of trade. Supereconomics uses three tools--money, points, and barter"

The root cause of the problem with economic value is the arbitrariness of the assignment of value due to the invention of paper bank notes and stock certificates.

This can be seen in:
- checks that have no money
- stock corporations that have wrong valuation 
- financial statements with cooked books

Even if money is avoided and metals are used, not all societies have gold and silver for facilitating transactions. 

<!-- It will not be a store of value that everyone can relate to.  -->

This is why Supereconomics uses the common food as the store of value. 
- In most cases, these will be grains such as rice or wheat.  
- In barren places that have little agriculture such as Greenland and Alaska, these are in fish or wild game.

The important thing that they should be prevalent and known by all, as to be the common measure of economic valuation.


{{< q a="Smith" c="Wealth of Nations, Book 1 Chapter 11" >}}
In every state of society and every stage of improvement, equal amounts of wheat will, more nearly represent equal amounts of labour than equal amounts of any rude produce.

In all the different stages of wealth and improvement, wheat is a more accurate measure of value than any other commodity.

In all those different stages, we can judge the real value of silver by comparing it with wheat than any other commodity.

This concept is the foundation of the grain index which will be used for: 
- Net Domestic Product
- Zero Inflation Goal
