### Fixing Materialism

The previous subchapter revealed that the cause of instability of economic systems is the focus on material pleasures as utility. 

This is caused by the Western hierarchy of needs which gave the most importance to physical needs over the metaphysical ones such as mental and spiritual. 

We solve this instability by flipping the temporal order of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Instead of physiological needs being first, we start with self-actualization. 

Our basis is David Hume saying that mentality creates reality:

{{< q a="Hume" >}}
It is an established maxim in metaphysics, that whatever the mind clearly conceives, includes the idea of possible existence, or in other words, nothing we imagine is absolutely impossible.
<cite>A Treatise of Human Nature, Book 1, Part 2, Section 2</cite>
{{< /q >}}


### Fixing Selfishness

Giving importance to metaphysical needs solves materialism. 

However, a person might still stay selfish. 
- He might use all his time and effort for himself, instead of connecting to society. 

To fix this, we replace selfish-interest with self-purpose in order to focus on the end goal.
- If the end is agreeable, then the means must be agreeable too (Hume, Book 3). 


<!-- Utility is based on selfishness

This metaphysical starting point is called the idea of the self. 
- The path taken by the self is then ruled by its interest as 'self-interest' which is an ambiguous word. 
- One may be 'interested' in pursuing material pleasures or in achieving spiritual goals. Western authors solve this by specifying an enlightened self-interest, as opposed to the ordinary one. 

But the word 'enlightened' is also unclear.
- Is stealing $1 more enlightened than stealing $1,000? 
- Is destroying a forest to build houses for the poor less enlightened than preserving it to reduce CO2 and global warming? -->

<!-- To get rid of this ambiguity, we change the word 'interest' into 'purpose'   -->


For example, a banker's purpose in life is to do banking. 

But we cannot say that a bank robber's life-purpose is to rob banks. This is because if all banks stopped existing then the bank-robber would also not have any purpose in life.

<!-- - Who would ever honestly say that his soul exists on Earth to rob banks?  -->

 <!-- since everyone feels that robbing is wrong and therefore cannot be a life goal. -->

Stealing might be a life goal of other animal species. But it would result in them having a flat hierarchy of needs.

If Bitcoin price is rising fast, then under Economics, you should buy it or be left out. 
- But in Supereconomics, only the crypto-trader should buy it because his life purpose is to trade crypto. 
- In this way, a Bitcoin crash will only affect the universe of crypto-traders and not everyone.



### The Supereconomic Hierarchy of Needs Based on Svadharma

This self-purpose is called *svadharma* in the Bhagavad-Gita. 

{{< q a="Krishna" c="Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 3, Verse 35" >}}
It is better to do one's own duty, even he fails to succeed in doing the duty of another. It is better to die performing one's duty, than to do another's duty with fear. 
{{< /q >}}

This self-purpose is in the top of the Supereconomic hierarchy of needs.
- The upper parts of the pyramid represent the metaphysical needs of the soul 
- The lower parts of the pyramid represent the material needs of the physical body


The focus of the soul goes down the pyramid as it addresses the needs of the soul and body. 
- What it cannot get by itself, it tries to get through others.

This it does by offering what it can, based on its skills, abilities, and personal qualities.

{{< img src="/graphics/econ/materialistic.jpg" alt="Supereconomic network and hierarchy of needs" cap="Our Supereconomic network of needs starts with the metaphysical center that branches out and downwards into physical needs. The core of this metaphysical center is The Tao or svadharma of that discrete entity. The person then goes outwards to meet other people to satify his or her material and metaphysical needs." >}}


- A materialistic society only caters to the material needs. It might have an abundance of material goods for sale, ecommerce, cryptocurrencies. But it is deficient in spritual ideology or even cultural practices. 
- A spiritual society has strong spritual ideology and rich traditional culture. But it might be materially backward.
- An ideal society is one that can satisfy all the hierarchal needs of every human, neglecting neither materiality nor spirituality.


<!-- In this way, the entity is not made subservient to the lower material layer.
- This helps it keep its stability amidst the onslaught of material perceptions.  -->

Monkeys (from where the human species came) are curious about objects and have been known to steal and run away with material objects. Thus, we can call humans that act as such as monkeys

<!-- ## Everything has a value because everything has a purpose

The word 'purpose' has more in common with the word 'dharma' than 'interest'. 

Superphysics views existence as being a huge mind or Matrix which the Hindus call the *Brahma*. A thing would only exist in a mind if its Thinker had a purpose for it.

Thus, we can say that everything that you perceive has a purpose. Those that didn't have a purpose never existed or never was perceived by you. 

The specific purpose of every discrete thing or entity is then called *The Tao* or *svadharma* meaning 'own dharma' or own purpose in existence.

The study of this svadharma in economics is a focus of Supereconomics,. 

This purpose is what gives value to everything. 
 
In this way, a baker bakes because he feels that his life purpose is to bake and that he could happily spend his whole life baking. 
- His passion in baking naturally allows him to make excellent bread which gets a nominal price from the viewpoint of the buyers

Therefore, his passion in baking represents:
- the nominal price to his customers, as the First Law of Value
- the real price for himself, as the Second Law of Value

If you do what you are passionate about then utility will always be at a maximum and there will be no marginal utility. This is why Supereconomics can do without marginal utility.


This focus on svadharma, from the viewpoint of the seller, makes up the Effort Theory of Value which is an essential component of the Second Law of Value.  

In contrast, in Economics, a baker bakes because he is supposed to be chasing the profits as the money from bread sales. To get more money, he logically must:
- adulterate his goods
- drive his costs down
- automate instead of using manual labor
- raise his sales through marketing.

In other words, the economic baker is not a baker but a merchant masquerading as a baker. More commonly, the baker was brainwashed to become a merchant.

Supereconomics keeps the baker as a baker and the merchant as a merchant. This is to preserve the division of labor in society and put everyone in their proper supereconomic place. -->



<!-- Eastern philosophy is full of warnings and safeguards against utility and worldly pleasures because the latter ultimately causes bondage within the dualistic universe. 

If existence were a video game, then profits would be the high scores. Materialistic people would find themselves playing over and over again to reach the highest score which has no limits. In such a case, existence itself becomes a trap, tempting people to stay in the game without any time to get permanent rest. -->

<!-- 
By following one's path and purpose in life, then humans can better understand how their dualistic world works. So, by replacing utility with self-purpose, Supereconomics not only can help people generate and distribute value among each other, but also increase their chances of understanding the reason for their existence so that they can exist in harmony with everything else that exists. 

A key characteristic of a supereconomic implementation or a *supereconomy* therefore is that it gives lower stress in exchange and acquisition of goods or services than that in economic, capitalist, or communist systems. -->

<!-- The Principles of Superphysics* makes its way into the other sciences
The use of the Tao as the center of the sciences makes it useful in solving the problems in those sciences. 

> *This is neatly packaged into the Four Laws of Value

As you can see, the fallacy of money and utility leading to self-acutalization mirrors the fallacy of using drugs to create happiness and solve depression. Since we proposed to solve economic crises by starting from the metaphysical center and travel to the economic problem, it means that we can also solve psychological and bodily problems by starting with the metaphysical cause or the person's Tao, which we call the G. 

This will then be the job of Medical Superphysics. We can even use it to solve problems in Modern Physics -->
