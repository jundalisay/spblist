The lack of self-control of a mind in assigning nominal value leads to a gambling tendency.


### Gambling is Gaming, which is Entertainment

Gambling lets you gain a lot of rewards, as resources, by expanding the least amount of effort. 

Socially, it is an injustice and is therefore from the Negative Force.

However, it provides a satisfaction to the winner and a thrill to the participants. This is why it is used in gaming as a form of entertainment.    

This is similar to:
- a gladiator match
- basketball or football game

In such sporting events, people can get injured just to achieve the most points. 
- There is a winner and a loser. 
- The winner feels happy.
- The loser feels sad. 

Yet these are allowed because:
- It has an entertainment value since the spectators imagine themselves to be the players
- It has a health value by promoting strength and good health
- It has a moral value by encouraging discipline, sacrifice, and training


But unlike sporting events, gambling only has entertainment value. Some types of gambling might have a positive effect as encouraging math skills or intuitional abilities. 

But this is rarely the case.

Most of the time, it is just pure ego, as risk-taking, that drives gambling. Some cases are even sourced from desperation. Such cases can be fatal and is the main discouragement of gambling to the point that it was banned by Islam. 

In contrast, Chinese and European culture does not ban gambling because their mentalities are mutative in nature.  
- This explains why China and Europe are both materially advanced, while Arabia is backward. 


### Gambling or Speculation on Commodities and Essentials Should be Banned

Invetors and Traders justify gambling on commodities and real estate as being similar to betting on horse races and sporting events. 

But the main difference is that those bettors enter the gambling deal actually fully knowing that they could lose all the money or resources that they bet with. 

Moreover, betting on sporting events lead to game-fixing which cancels the entertainment value and other benefits of the event. 

Betting on economic commodities and essentials therefore 'fixes' the economy to benefit the trading class, and transfers the losses to the other 3 classes: workers, warriors, and thinkers.

### Solution to the Gambling or Speculation Tendency: Clearing Funds

The good aspect of the gambling tendency is the risk-taking attitude that leads to strong activity that breaks the usual idleness or staticity that always creeps into any economy.  

Supereconomics taps this attitude to spur international and intranational trade through the Clearing Funds of Pool Clearing.
