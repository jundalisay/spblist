<!-- ### Liberalism

This began right after the French Revolution.

Socialism.

   - **Core Ideas**:
     - **Emphasis on Individual Rights and Equality**: Liberalism is a political and moral philosophy that emphasizes the protection of individual rights, **freedom**, and **equality**. It has evolved over time and has two primary strands: **classical liberalism** and **social liberalism**.
     - **Classical Liberalism**: Focuses on individual freedom, limited government, and free-market economics. It advocates for minimal government interference, similar to libertarianism, but is more accepting of certain government functions, such as maintaining a social safety net.
     - **Social Liberalism**: This strand supports a **welfare state**, with more active government involvement in the economy to ensure social justice and reduce inequality. Social liberals argue that the government should play a role in regulating markets, providing public goods (like healthcare and education), and redistributing wealth to ensure fairness.

   - **Key Principles**:
     - **Freedom of speech**
     - **Equality before the law**
     - **Social justice**
     - **Democratic governance**

   - **Modern Liberalism** (especially in the U.S. and Europe) tends to favor a **regulated market economy**, **universal healthcare**, and **progressive taxation**.

 - **Core Ideas**:
     - **Individual Liberty**: Central to liberalism is the idea of individual freedom, both in terms of personal rights and economic opportunities.
     - **Market Economy**: Liberals generally support a market-driven economy where private individuals and companies own the means of production, but with some regulation by the state to ensure fair competition and prevent abuses (e.g., anti-trust laws).
     - **Rule of Law**: Advocates for the protection of individual rights through a system of laws that apply equally to all people.
     - **Limited Government**: Liberalism supports a government that exists primarily to protect individuals' rights and freedoms, and maintain order, but without excessive interference in personal and economic affairs.
     - **Social Justice**: While classic liberalism emphasizes individual freedom, modern liberalism (especially in social democracies) also supports policies to ensure social welfare, including healthcare, education, and economic security for citizens.

   - **Economic Characteristics**:
     - Support for **free markets**, but with **some regulation** to prevent monopolies and ensure fairness.
     - Emphasis on **property rights** and individual entrepreneurship.
     - Belief in **social safety nets** (welfare, unemployment benefits, etc.) to protect citizens from economic hardship.

   - **Examples**:
     - Classical Liberalism: Advocated by thinkers like John Locke and Adam Smith.
     - Modern Liberalism: Seen in social democratic systems like those in the Scandinavian countries.


Key Features: Anarchism emerged as a reaction to both the state and capitalism in the wake of the French Revolution. Anarchists rejected centralized authority and sought to create societies based on voluntary cooperation and mutual aid, without government or hierarchical structures.
Key Figures: Early anarchist thinkers such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (who famously declared "Property is theft") critiqued both state power and private property, advocating for federations of communes and direct action.


### Anarchism

This also began after the French Revolution. This opposed all forms of hierarchical authority, including the state, capitalism, and other systems that impose power and control over individuals.

It:
- requires voluntary cooperation where individuals and communities organize themselves without the need for government or centralized control.
- favors:
  - direct action such as protests, strikes, boycotts
  - self-management such as worker-run cooperatives, community self-governance).

Most anarchists seek:
- the abolition of capitalism
- decentralized decision-making, where power is distributed at the local level, and communities have autonomy over their own affairs
seeing it as an economic system that exploits workers and reinforces inequality. -->
     


It rejects private property in favor of collective ownership or communal resources.

Advocacy for **self-managed cooperatives** and workersâ€™ control of production.
- Anti-capitalist and anti-state, seeking to replace both with decentralized and voluntary systems of cooperation.
- **Free Markets** in some forms of anarchism (e.g., anarcho-capitalism), but usually combined with strong anti-authoritarian principles.

<!--      - **Anarcho-syndicalism**: A branch of anarchism focusing on direct worker control of industries through unions or syndicates.
     - **Anarcho-communism**: Advocates for a stateless, classless society with common ownership of the means of production.
     - **Anarcho-capitalism**: A controversial form that blends anarchism with free-market capitalism. -->
