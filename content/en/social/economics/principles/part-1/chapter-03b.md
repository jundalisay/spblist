Universal Basic Income (UBI) became popular in 2016 after it was adopted by a few Western countries. 

In UBI, money is given to poor people without any strings attached. This makes it a bit different from Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) which imposes conditions that the poor must meet.


## What's Wrong with Universal Basic Income? 

In general, studies have found 2 flaws in UBI:

1. It contributes little to alleviate poverty as a whole
2. It is expensive to administer

Adam Smith, the founder of Economics, would be against UBI because:
- It can only be measured in nominal value
- It acts as an expense instead of as a capital -- there is no guarantee that the recipient will use it for education to build up his knowledge, or to buy healthy food to build up his body


{{< q a="Smith" c="The Wealth of Nations Simplified, Book 3" >}}
In towns principally supported by the residence of a court, the poor are chiefly maintained by the spending of revenue. The inferior ranks are generally idle, dissolute, and poor..
<br>In mercantile and manufacturing towns, the poor are chiefly maintained by the employment of capital. They are generally industrious, sober, and thriving.. It is better, says the proverb, to play for nothing than to work for nothing.
{{< /q >}}

<!-- 
Neoliberals want UBI because it will give money to the poor who will then use it to buy goods and services of businesses. It increases sales and therefore profits, even if there is no assurance whether those poor people will spend it wisely. 
 -->

Development banks want UBI for them to find use for their idle money which is of no value when not circulating. **Therefore, UBI is an easy sign that the profits in lending are very low, that banks have to find radically new business models.**

Governments of democratic countries like Brazil and the Philippines want it because it lets them placate the poor and prevent public disobedience or the rise of Communism or terrorism. Unofficially, it helps politicians buy votes*. The abandonment of UBI in Finland and Bolsa Familia in Brazil are proofs that UBI is not sustainable.

{{< n n="*This is proven by presidential candidates using dole outs during their election campaigns" >}}


<!-- Canada and Finland, which are experimenting with UBI, are coincidentally the 4th and 5th largest gambling nations according to CNBC. Ontario, where UBI will be tested in Canada, also has the largest 2008 gambling revenue  of all the Canadian provinces. -->


## Microfinance is Better

Smith would rather be in favor of microfinance which are small loans, usually given to poor people to start a micro-business or cooperative. 
- The loans would then be used to provide wages, reducing unemployment
- The wages would then be used to pay for the education of children

Loans are supposed to serve as one's capital, and thus, are not supposed to be spent recklessly as an expense. A capital pays for itself, but an expense does not.


### Problems with Microfinance

This solution would not work if there are many regulations against self-made goods or services. Assuming that the law allows solo and cooperative enterprise, then microfinance would have 2 general problems, one with supply and another with demand:

1. The demanders of loans are poor people who are deficient in practical skills like saving, diligence, hardwork, grit, problem solving, etc, otherwise they would not be poor in the first place. This could be caused by childhood development problems, bad environment, oppressive family or community members, and so on.

2. The banks might be predatory or inefficient especially in poor countries where the morals are low, law enforcement is not strict, or infrastructure is undeveloped.

<!-- To fix this problem, our system uses a profiling system called Match and a points-based valuation system called Basic Universal Revenue. These subsystems fix the fundamental problems of microfinance and universal basic income, which is the overreliance on money that only shows quantity and has no ability to show quality. These also prevent inflation and price volatility since there is no single currency to amass. -->


### Pros and Cons

Microfinance, UBI, CCT thus have pros and cons:

_ | UBI | CCT | Microfinance
--- | --- | --- | ---
Pros | It mobilizes productivity liberally by feeding it cash | It prevents this mobilization from being unproductive by imposing conditions | Its conditions are simpler -- the debtor just needs to repay regularly
Cons | It has no control to prevent this moblization from being unproductive | Its conditions require administration which requires a big expense | Few people are eligible



## Pointization Solution

Supereconomics introduces the concept of pointization or the conversion of economic value into points which are pegged to grains. This is part of a commodity-based resource mechanism mentioned in Chapter 2c.

These points are created whenever there is an agreement by two parties.

For example, John can give his harvest of 1 kilogram of potatoes to Martha in exchange for 2 points (assuming that 1 kilogram of potatoes is worth 2 kilograms of wheat).
- John will then have a right to claim those 2 points as whatever Martha is producing. 
- If she is a baker, then John can claim bread worth 2 points from her in the future. 

Thus, **the points are not created by any bank, but by the people themselves judging the value of the goods and services of others relative to themselves and others.** 

The points can only be created and destroyed as deposits and claims, similar to tags in a baggage counter. As such, the points are not exchangeable and are not legal tender.

So far, only the [take tags](https://moneylesssociety.com/)* of the Resource Based Economy (RBE) has a similar yet rudimentary idea of this.   

{{< n n="*These are different from a gift economy and a time-banking system.The flaw in RBE is that [they have no background on metaphysics](/social/economics/fallacies/resource-based-economy). This makes them focus on physical resources, different from Supereconomics which is based on fellow-feeling" >}}


This service provides the following advantages:
- Like UBI, it mobilizes productivity by letting people feed each other with points<!--  it made exchanges easier since everyone could trade using a single currency.   --> 
- Like CCT, it imposes conditions between people based on their agreements
- Like Microfinance, the points can be claimed regularly to see which point-producers are actually productive and reliable 


When viewed on a macro level, the points-deposits represent an estimate of future productivity. 

This is different from money-deposits which represent actual productivity. Money-deposits are governed by interest rates as the 'time value of money', but points-deposits are governed by the moral sentiments* of the exchangers. 

{{< n n="*This is why The Theory of Moral Sentiments is needed before The Wealth of Nations" >}}


- 'Monetization' speeds up an economy by converting goods and services into money through sales
- 'Pointization' is the opposite conversion of money into a promise of future resources. 

Pointization thus saves companies and societies from a monetary crash, by facilitating a soft-landing<!-- through goods and services -->. <!-- numerous loans will allow the unsold productivity of a slowing-down economy to be stored in order to avoid -->

### Basic Points Revenue

The points are very useful during crises. During personal crises, the points manifest as 'Basic Points Revenue' or BPR. It will convert anyone's productivity into points which can be exchanged for food or other basic needs to get through a crisis.

This is similar to how the Inca established a nonmonetary economy using strings called *quipu* that represented an amount of food in the granary.

{{< img src="/photos/econ/quipu.jpg" cap="Adam Smith cited the Inca and Mongol civilizations as proof that large economies do not need currency to survive. The Inca used strings to represent food assets stored in community-granaries which were then traded for military service. Instead of strings, we use points. Instead of granaries, we use community hubs" alt="Quipu strings" >}}

A donor can jumpstart the economy by giving food to the poor in exchange for points which the donor can claim through the labor or produce of the poor. For example, if the donor is the government, then:
- it can provide food for the relief of the poor
- The poor will then give back the points by being street sweepers or agricultural workers for the government when at their leisure.

In this way, BPR can create full employment witout being a debt-trap like microfinance, nor encourage idleness as what happens with UBI. It can also be administered fully online, making it cheaper to run.

<!-- It might not make sense to make food as the foundation of an economic system, now that food is plentiful. But it will make more sense when global warming and overpopulation starts making food less easy to come by. It will make the most sense in future human colonies in other planets where food is not guaranteed. -->
<!-- 
> *The problem is that humans creatures are often lazy in mind and body and so wealthy societies often abandon work (cause) and just focus on wealth (effect). They start outsourcing their work to poorer countries and gamble with existing wealth in an effort to multiply it with zero effort. In time, the gambling creates financial crises, while poorer countries start to become wealthier and outsell the wealthy countries who have long lost the desire for hard work and merely want everything to come easy. This happened with the Roman Empire and Song dynasty outsourcing their military work to German and Mongol barbarians respectively, only to find themselves being ruled by those "uncivilized" people later on. The fact that the Great Britain outsourced their work to the American colonies and that the modern Americans outsourced their work to Communist China proves that this human propensity is still in force, and thus, is a principle observable in the human species throughout time and space. The dynamics of this principle will be explained further in Social Superphysics.
