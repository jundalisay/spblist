## Money 
Money comes from the Latin *moneta* which means mint, which is the act of converting metal into coins. 
Currency is money that is the current medium of exchange. For example, an online game might use credits as its in-game currency. 

A money becomes legal tender if the government allows it to be used for payments, including the payment of taxes and the settlement of debts.

#### Fiat Money
#### Cryptocurrency
El Salvador is an example of a country that has legalized Bitcoin, making it a legal tender.    

### Tangible Points -->

In order to facilitate exchanges of goods and services, humans need a tool. 

Historically, the tools for exchange were commodities: 

{{< q a="Smith" c="Wealth of Nations, Book 1, Chapter 4" >}}
Homer says that the armour of Diomede cost only 9 oxen, and that of Glaucus cost 100 oxen.

The following were the common instrument of commerce:
- salt in Abyssinia
- shells in some parts of the coast of India
- dried cod at Newfoundland- tobacco in Virginia
- sugar in some of our West India colonies

I am told that to this day, workers in a village in Scotland can carry nails instead of money to the baker's shop or the ale-house.

These were exchanged based on volume or weight:

{{< q a="Montesquieu" c="Spirit of the Laws, Book 22, Chapter 1">}}
The following people trade by exchange:
- savages who have few merchandise
- civilized nations who have only two or three species.

The caravans of Moors who go to Timbuktu, in the heart of Africa, do not need money. They exchange their salt for gold. The Moor puts his salt in a heap. The Negro puts his gold dust in another. If there is not gold enough, the Moor takes away some of his salt, or the Negro adds more gold, until both parties are agreed..

Basing value on weight is really basing it on its material density, since denser bodies are heavier. This is really a quantitative way. 

Gradually, as humans became more civilized, they chose precious coins as their tool. The preciousness is the qualitative way. 

Coins standardized the value and prevented fraud:

{{< q a="Smith" >}}
Mints are institutions exactly of the same nature as the aulnagers and stampmasters of woollen and linen cloth. Through a public stamp, they ascertain the amount and uniform goodness of those commodities when brought to market. 

The first public stamps affixed to precious metals were intended to ascertain the goodness or fineness of the metal.

<!-- From precious coins, the world moved on to bimetallism, the gold standard, and then fiat money.   -->

This money system was used by the commercial system and mercantilism.
- This disrupted native modes of valuation and exchange of using commodities and weights. 

Coinage was later standardized into silver, and augmented by paper bank notes and paper stock certificates. This allowed rapid economic growth because people could now increase money nominally by writing bigger numbers. 

This manifests as paper assets and paper wealth that can be created or be made to vanish quickly, through: 

- hyperinflation and financial crisis during the Mississippi Scheme
- stock bubbles like the South Sea Bubble 
- poverty and inequality during the industrial revolution

These problems persist even today.


### Grains as the Store of Value

The root cause of the problem with economic value is the arbitrariness of the assignment of value due to the invention of paper bank notes and stock certificates.

This can be seen in:
- checks that have no money
- stock corporations that have wrong valuation 
- financial statements with cooked books

Even if money is avoided and metals are used, not all societies have gold and silver for facilitating transactions. 

<!-- It will not be a store of value that everyone can relate to.  -->

This is why Supereconomics uses the common food as the store of value. 
- In most cases, these will be grains such as rice or wheat.  
- In barren places that have little agriculture such as Greenland and Alaska, these are in fish or wild game.

The important thing that they should be prevalent and known by all, as to be the common measure of economic valuation.


{{< q a="Smith" c="Wealth of Nations, Book 1 Chapter 11" >}}
In every state of society and every stage of improvement, equal amounts of wheat will, more nearly represent equal amounts of labour than equal amounts of any rude produce.

In all the different stages of wealth and improvement, wheat is a more accurate measure of value than any other commodity.

In all those different stages, we can judge the real value of silver by comparing it with wheat than any other commodity.

This concept is the foundation of the grain index which will be used for: 
- Net Domestic Product
- Zero Inflation Goal
