The First Law is aligned with the Worker class. 

This is called the Shudra in Hinduism. In the Republc by Plato, this is called the Democrats.

These are people who live by manual work or service. These people work to satisfy their own demands.  

In the beginning of a society, more people are manual workers. This is true whether for nations, tribes, organizations, or businesses.

A startup company, for example, would need a lot of workers to get it up and running quickly amidst the competition from established rivals.

<!-- The reliance on physical power gradually led a chosen few to lead the rest by physical strength. They were the leaders of the shúdras.

Simultaneously, the family developed.
