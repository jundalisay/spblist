In Economics, the urban economy has higher importance than the rural economy beause of the amassing of wealth fromt he Capitalist system. 

In Supereconomics, both urban and rural economies have importance. This is because the basis for the economy is the grain value. 

While Economics favors the trading class, Supereconomics favors the working class, specifically the farmers who provide food for society. 

Supereconomics also gives importance to the wildlife and natural environment that are essential to support the weather and climate systems for sustainable agriculture.

 <!-- These need to be protected.   -->

The rural economy can be divided into two:

1. Agriculture and Extractive
2. Forestry and Wildlife 


## Agriculture: Farming Models

Agriculture has several models of organization and operation.

<!-- , each designed to meet the varying needs of farmers, investors, and consumers. These models are often adopted to enhance production, improve efficiency, and create value chains in agriculture. Below are some common models, including plantation models, contract farming, and others: -->

### Rural Agriculture

1. Plantation Model

This involves large-scale farming on private or state-owned land, usually producing cash crops such as tea, coffee, rubber, sugarcane, or oilseeds.

This uses monoculture farming, where only one type of crop is grown over a large area.

The land is usually owned by large corporations or wealthy individuals who either employ workers directly or contract labor for the production. The crops are often sold to large companies or export markets.

Because of its large size, it often involves Capitalist foreign direct investment (FDI) in countries with favorable climatic conditions for specific crops. The investor often provides worker housing, infrastructure, and healthcare.

Its drawbacks are:
- its dependence on the market price for cash crops.
- environmental concerns such as monoculture farming and deforestation

Examples are:
- tea plantations in India
- coffee plantations in Brazil
- banana plantations in Honduras
- pineapple plantations in the Philippines
- rubber plantations in Malaysia
- palm oil plantations in Indonesia


2. Corporate Farming / Agribusiness Model

Corporate farming involves large, corporate-owned farms that may operate on a national or international scale. These corporations may employ advanced technology, economies of scale, and vertical integration (owning the supply chain from production to processing and retail).

This model typically involves large-scale monoculture farming, with the corporation responsible for production, processing, packaging, and distribution. The focus is often on efficiency, high yields, and profit maximization.

- Use of advanced machinery and technology.
- Focus on large-scale, efficient production.
- Vertical integration and control over supply chains.
- Risk of environmental degradation due to monoculture practices and high chemical use.
- **Examples**: Large agribusinesses like Cargill, Monsanto, and Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), which engage in everything from crop production to food processing.


3. Contract Farming

Contract farmers grow crops or raise livestock according to an agreement with a buyer (often a company or processor) who provides inputs like seeds, fertilizers, or technical expertise.

In return, the buyer agrees to purchase the produce at a set price, often being responsible for collection, processing, and distribution.

   <!-- - **Structure**: The contract can be between the farmer and a corporation, cooperative, or intermediary who facilitates the arrangement.  -->

This model helps ensure the buyer has a steady supply of agricultural products, while farmers are assured a market and sometimes financial support.

<!--      - Financial support like loans or advances is sometimes provided.
     - Quality control and standardized farming practices are emphasized.
     - The buyer may  -->

This reduces the market risk for farmers but might reduce autonomy and profit margins.

Examples are contract farming for crops like tomatoes, corn, and cotton, and livestock such as poultry and dairy.


4. Cooperative Farming

This involves farmers coming together to form a cooperative society to pool resources for joint farming efforts. 

The goal is to increase bargaining power, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.

The cooperative can handle tasks such as bulk purchasing of inputs (seeds, fertilizers, machinery), joint processing and storage of products, and marketing of farm produce. The profits are usually distributed based on individual contributions.

<!--   Shared resources and responsibilities.
     - Greater market power and negotiation leverage.
     - Economies of scale lead to reduced costs.
     - Democratic decision-making within the cooperative.
     - Risk-sharing among members. -->

This is the most difficult model to set up because there has to be fellow-feeling among the memebers. This is opposed to the profit motive in the previous models. 

Examples are dairy cooperatives like Amul in India, agricultural cooperatives in Europe.


<!-- ### 4. **Outgrower/Outsourcing Model**
   - **Definition**: This model involves a company or large corporation outsourcing the production of crops or livestock to smallholder farmers. Farmers act as "outgrowers" and typically receive inputs and technical assistance from the contracting company.
   - **Structure**: The outgrowers generally grow specific crops or raise animals under a contract agreement. The company may provide inputs, offer extension services, and buy back the produce at pre-agreed prices. The model allows companies to reduce the need for direct production while helping small farmers access markets.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Farmers may receive loans for inputs and technical support.
     - The company typically guarantees a market for the product.
     - Risk-sharing between the farmer and the company.
     - Company often dictates the terms of production, including the type of crop or livestock.
   - **Examples**: Smallholder tobacco farming in Africa, cocoa outgrowers in Ghana. -->


5. Integrated Farming

This combines crop production with livestock farming, agroforestry, and aquaculture in a way that creates synergies and maximizes land and resource use.

This is commonly the tradtional model used by small holder farmers and is the most sustainable. 

<!--    - **Structure**: A farm may combine different agricultural activities to optimize resource utilization and increase overall productivity. For example, crops can provide feed for livestock, while livestock manure can be used as fertilizer for crops.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Diversification reduces risk, as not all crops or activities fail simultaneously.
     - Sustainable practices are promoted, reducing dependency on chemical inputs.
     - By-products from one activity serve as inputs for another, increasing the farm's sustainability and profitability. -->

Examples are Crop-livestock integration, fish farming combined with vegetable or rice cultivation, mixed farming.


<!-- 6. **Agroforestry**
   - **Definition**: Agroforestry involves integrating trees with crops or livestock to create more diverse, productive, and sustainable land-use systems. It combines agriculture and forestry to optimize both ecological and economic outcomes.
   - **Structure**: Trees can be planted on cropland or pastureland, alongside agricultural crops or livestock, with the goal of improving soil fertility, conserving water, and increasing overall productivity.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Reduces soil erosion and improves soil health.
     - Provides additional income through timber, fruits, nuts, or other tree-based products.
     - Enhances biodiversity and ecosystem services.
     - Often seen as a sustainable farming practice.
   - **Examples**: Coffee and cocoa plantations with shade trees, livestock grazing under tree cover, fruit trees in maize fields. -->


### Urban Agriculture

During the pandemic, urban agriculture gained popularity because of lockdowns and the price inflation of food.

1. Community-Supported Agriculture

This is where consumers (often urban dwellers) buy shares in a local farm's harvest before the growing season. In exchange, they receive a weekly supply of fresh produce directly from the farm.

Community farmers typically grow a variety of crops and distribute them to shareholders on a regular basis (e.g., weekly or monthly) throughout the growing season.

The consumers share the risks and rewards of farming (if there’s a good harvest, they get more produce; if there’s a poor harvest, they get less).

These often focuses on organic or sustainable farming practices.

Examples are local CSA farms in the United States, Europe, and parts of Asia.


2. Urban Agriculture / Vertical Farming

Urban agriculture involves growing crops within city environments, often using innovative farming techniques such as vertical farming or hydroponics.

Urban farms may be small and located on rooftops, vacant lots, or inside buildings. 

{{< i s="/photos/bio/plant.jpg" a="Plant" >}}

Vertical farming uses stacked layers or hydroponic systems to grow crops indoors, utilizing artificial light and climate control.

The benefits includes:
- the reduction of carbon footprint associated with transportation
- the use of sustainable practices and technology (e.g., water-saving techniques)
- direct supply of fresh produce to urban communities

Examples are:
- rooftop farms in New York
- hydroponic and vertical farms in Singapore


<!-- ## The 7 Obstacles to Agricultural Development

In The Lectures on Jurisprudence, Adam Smith enumerated the 7 obstacles to agriculture:

1. Lack of cultivation by the big land owners

2. Payment of the rent in kind

The farmer has less produce to pay as rent after a bad harvest, but he will have a bit more money to pay because the scarcity will increase the money price of his little harvest.

3. Additional taxes by the government (kings)

4. Right of Primogeniture and Entails

Feudal Rules in Property Transfer

5. Banning Food Exports During Famines

6. Slave labour

7. Oppression of merchants and private enterprise

Only the Jews were strong enough to withstand oppression, well enough to make money

The oppression by merchants and private enterprises against rural industries can take the form of the following:

7.a. Imperfect law on contracts

7.b. Difficulty of transportation

7.c. The monopoly of fairs and markets and staple towns

7.d. Taxes on imported and exported goods

7.e. The monopoly and exclusive privileges of corporations

7.f. The statute of apprenticeship

7.g. Some bounties which encourage one commodity and hinder another -->
