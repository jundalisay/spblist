## Liberalism

Liberalism came as an effect of Mercantilism.

Foreign trade brought a lot of wealth to Europe, creating a sense of empowerment and desire for freedom. Prior to this, the Church was dominant and imposed modestry, austerity, and frugality.  

The increase in sensory desires led to the fall of the Church through the French Revolution which separated the Church from the State. 

From that time onwards, the austere policy was abandoned in favor of wealth and economic growth.

The main proponents of liberalism are:

1. John Locke (1632–1704)

His writings on natural rights, including life, liberty, and property, are central to liberal thought.

He argued that individuals have inalienable rights and that government exists to protect these rights, with its power being derived from the consent of the governed.

Locke's social contract theory greatly influenced liberal democratic thought and the principles of limited government, equality, and individual freedom.

2. Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778)

He also pushed for a social contract theory, as well as corporate organization. 


3. John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) 

He created the concept of Utilitarianism which is really based on material pleasures. 

His moral rule is for everyone to pursue his happiness. The flaw in Mill's philosophy is that **personal happiness is subjective**. If pursued without thinking of others, then it becomes arbitrary. 

For example, it might bring happiness to a rich country to invade a poorer country for oil as the former would think that it would bring happiness and progress to both countries.

Conversely, it might bring happiness to terrorists to attack a rich, extravagant country thinking that it would bring it closer to simplicity and austerity which are foundations for religious happiness. Even Jesus himself said it will be difficult for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God.

**Utilitarianism is useful only when one is alone.** 

It, however, creates problems when one comes into society because people have diverse experiences, opinions, and moral standards. 

It's the type of thing that works only in thought experiments but fails in the real world. 



### Socialism

Socialism started gaining ground in the 19th century through the inequality that went with the rise of wealth of Europe from the Mercantile system.

This led to moral decline.

We can say that Socialism is the natural effect of Liberalism. 

The French economists Henri de Saint-Simon pushed this as an alternative to the unregulated freedom after the French Revolution had destroyed the controlling power of the monarchy and the church.

Socialism advocates for collective or governmental control over the means of production to ensure wealth and resources are distributed more equally. 

It emphasizes:
- social welfare
- economic equality
- workers’ rights
- state or collective ownership of major industries
- progressive taxation
- wealth redistribution to reduce inequality

Examples are The Soviet Union, Cuba, and modern social democracies (e.g., Sweden).



### Democratic Socialism

Unlike Socialism which has strong central control, democratic socialism combines emphasizes the democratic political system.

It advocates for the **public ownership** of essential industries and services (e.g., healthcare, education) while allowing private ownership in other sectors.

It has High taxation, wealth redistribution, universal public services, and workers' rights protection.

Examples are the Modern Scandinavian countries (e.g., Denmark, Norway), as well as the UK under Labour governments.
