Capital is combined with effort in order to produce real exchangeable value. 

Primary Arbitrage is the difference between the real value perceived by the producer with the nominal value perceived by the buyer. 

Chapter 1 gave a scenario with 4 cake-makers, each with different skills in making cakes. Here we add their different desires for cake. 


Person | Effort to make 1 cake as baker | Nominal Value as buyer
--- | --- | ---
Chef | 2 | 2
Arun | 4 | 3
Bhaskar | 6 | 4
Chandra | 8 | 5


We combine the supply and demand of the 4 people regarding cakes:

Baker/Purchaser | Purchaser Chef 2 | Purchaser Arun 3 | Purchaser Bhaskar 4 | Purchaser Chandra 5
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Baker Chef 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
Baker Arun 4 | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1
Baker Bhaskar 6 | -4 | -3 | -2 | -1
Baker Chandra 8 | -6 | -5 | -4 | -3
 

This exposes the following information:

- the biggest primary arbitrage is with Chef as baker and Chandra as purchaser 
- the most negative arbitrage is with Chandra as baker and Chef as purchaser
- Bhaskar and Chandra should not be bakers
- If Arun starts a baking business, he will struggle more than Chef
- Chef should engage in baking


In Economics, this is similar to the concepts of core compentency and comparative advantage.

This can be expanded to countries. For example, there are 3 countries thinking of engaging in rice exporting

Country | Effort to make 1 kilo of rice | Nominal Value as importer
--- | --- | ---
India | 1 | 3
Vietnam | 2 | 2
Philippines | 4 | 6

This will lead to the following primary arbitrage table:

Exporter/Importer | Importer India 3 | Importer Vietnam 2 | Importer Philippines 6
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Exporter India 1 | 2 | 1 | 5
Exporter Vietnam 2 | 1 | 0 | 4
Exporter Philippines 4 | -1 | -2 | 2

This exposes the following information:

- The best trade partners are Exporter India and Importer Philippines
- India is the best exporter of rice
- India and the Philippines can improve their local production to address their local demand
- The Philippines should not export rice

<!-- The difference is that this arbitrage is compared to the person himself since Superphysics believes that each person is made up of 3 billion selves. 

So primary arbitrage is the highest advantage that the person produces against his other selves and the other people in the same field or industry. 

This manifests as the real price versus the nominal price demanded by the people. --> 

## How to Improve Primary Arbitrage: Purpose Maximization

Primary Arbitrage can be improved in 2 ways:

1. Reducing the real price

The real price is the cost in toil or trouble to the producer or seller. 

This is done by:
- focusing on self-purpose or core competency 
- education and training
- capital accumulation as to create economies of scale and other efficincies
- technology and infrastructure

In Economics, these steps lead to specialization and comparative advantage.


2. Increasing nominal price

This is in finding who are the best customers for your product or service. This is already implemented in business through the Pareto principle.

<!-- where and who  the demand of the people for a product or service.  -->

This is done by:
- market research and business development
- marketing and advertising


We call the increase of primary arbitrage as *Purpose Maximization*.

<!-- The social end result of the journey from nominal to real to natural value is market value. 

Step | Value | Example | Incentive
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | Nominal | Woman wants a cake |
2 | Real | Man skilled in cakes bakes a cake | Primary Arbitrage
3 | Natural | Support, Competition, or Regulations sustain cake-making |  
4 | Market | Man sells the cake to the woman and others | Secondary Arbitrage


In the past, this was done through barter, giving more power to real value, the primary producers, and primary arbitrage. This led to specialization which manifested as the class or caste system in ancient India, Egypt, and China.  -->


### The Neglect of Real Value Leads to the Neglect of Primary Arbitrage

The invention of money as bank notes, and of certificates of stock in the 16th century increased the speed of exchange, as the Mercantile system.

This led to the dominance of nominal and market prices over real and natural prices. 

**Thus, real value was neglected in favor of market value**

The Mercantile system prioritized secondary arbitrage in order to focus on profit maximization, which we overhaul into *Market Maximization*. 

<!-- but shifted the power to market value, the merchant-retailers, and secondary arbitrage. To get even more revenue, the merchants advocated profit maximization which overshadowed real value and the natural price. Mercantilism and the Commercial system was born. Mercantilism became Economics and the Commercial system became e-commerce and commercial banking.

Economics uses only secondary arbitrage which enriches only the retailers: speculators, brokers, stock markets, job agencies, outsourcers, and the financial system.  -->


Supereconomics creates more wealth than Economics because it will have 2 arbitrages:

1. Primary or personal
2. Secondary or social


<!-- physics, on the other hand, uses both primary and secondary arbitrage to enrich both the retailers and the artists, producers, farmers, workers, and freelancers themselves. Superphysics tries to discover the hidden value of everyone in order to increase their primary arbitrage and increase the real productivity and value in society.

This is done by having two ways of exchange:
1. Points-based: this emphasizes primary arbitrage
2. Money-based: this emphasizes secondary arbitrage

In the beginning, the points-based transactions will be tiny relative to the money-based ones. However in time, the points-based ones will grow until it balances the money-based transactions. Having two ways allow circulation to continue even if there is a crisis in one way.  -->

Having two arbitrages ensures that a *supereconomy* will be more dynamic than an economy. In fact, Smith predicted that people will work so hard in such a system that caps on revenue would have to be decreed to protect the people's health:

{{< q a="Adam-Smith" >}}
Our soldiers are not the most industrious people. Yet when they are liberally paid by the piece, their officers were frequently obliged to stipulate that they should not be allowed to earn above a certain rate every day. Before this stipulation, soldiers frequently overworked and hurt their health by mutual emulation and the desire of greater gain.

<!-- This productive Supereconomic system will be essential in helping societies rise up from the ashes of the debt and decline from Covid, through the Invisible Hand of Human Dharma. -->
