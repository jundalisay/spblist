The Supereconomic supply model also slopes downward like the demand model. 

This is because supply is subordinate to demand. This is the opposite of Economics where supply fights demand.

In this way, supply and demand work together to remove lack by addressing all demand as much as possible in real time.

### Economies of Scale

The proof of the downward-sloping supply curve is the phenomenon of economies of scale.

This happens when capital is pooled or accumulated in order to create supply efficiency and reduce the real value as the cost of production.
