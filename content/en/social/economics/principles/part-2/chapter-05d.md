During economic crises, the points can be used as interest-free deposits of goods and services to distressed companies. Those deposits can be paid back with the future productivity of those companies. 

<!-- use of resource credits which are social contracts that give right to assets or resources (products and services) in lieu of money.  -->

{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/resourcization.png" cap="Pointization converts nominal value into real value" >}}

For example, a soon-to-be bankrupt airline can stay afloat by getting a deposit of fuel and parts that it needs to maintain its fleet. 
- In return, it gives flier miles to its creditors for the value of those resources.
- Instead of an interest rate, a direct markup is assigned.  





The dominance of money as a resource mechanism in society leads to problems because it is the crudest mechanism possible. 


If we plug it into our 5 Strata model, we find that it occupies the lowest stratum. This is because, as a represntative number, it is purely quantitative and not qualitative. This makes it very precise, but at the expense of other information. 


{{< i s="/graphics/econ/quality.jpg" a="Quality vs Quantity" c="Quantity reduces and loses information for the sake of precision" >}}

For example, we can think of 3 tomatoes as either:
- 3 real, red, wet, juicy, shiny tomatoes, or
  - This one has a lot of information that is expressed during our perception of them.
- `3` and `"tomato"`  
  - This only has 2 pieces of infromation: `3` and `tomatoes`

<!-- we can think of 3 tomatoes as merely the number `3` and the word "tomato".  -->


And so quantitative resource mechanisms drastically reduce the amount of information in every transaction. This is done so that decision makers can make quick decisions through aggregated data, instead of granularly making decisions for each item. 

> Quantitative resource mechanisms drastically reduce the amount of information in every transaction

For example, assume you were a manager who had to fire 10% of your 100 staff who you did not personally know. To make a quick decision you would refer to some quantitative data like productivity or contribution to revenue. 

However, you might not be aware that some of your staff are contributing in non quantative means to the success of your company. 

Relying on quantitative information would therefore lead to bad decisions. However, qualitative information would be hard to define or cause information overload. Or it would incur a cost to collect. 

This is why large companies tend to rely mostly on quantitative information or metrics.

Society can incur the cost of getting that qualitative information about its people because the purpose of society is not to get a quantity of money. It is to raise the quality of life. 

Information overload can be addressed by artificial intelligence.



<!-- The final showdown between the commercial and the traditional system took place as the Opium Wars wherein the Chinese were defeated.

Because of the European commercial system and colonization, all countries adopted the European system of precious metals.

This led to:
- national currencies which were intially based on the gold standard, but later was replaced by fiat money
- money being the sole tool for valuation and exchange

This disrupted the natural balance of the 4 classes (Worker, Leader, Thinker, Trader) giving more importance to traders and merchants.  -->

### Stores of Value

We can classify resource mechanisms into two:

Basis | Examples
--- | ---
Trust-based | Fiat Money, Cryptocurrency 
Commodity-based | Gold Standard, Use of salt, shells, nails, oxen, etc
<!-- Morality-based | Points such as quipu strings -->


1. Trust-based

These rely on some common interest that may or may not be moral. For example, the US Dollar bill has the words "In God We Trust". This implies a common interest in trusting the system. 

The same is true for cryptocurrencies wherein you have blind trust in the crypto issuer. 


2. Commodity-based

These are the native means of exchange. Examples, as meniotned earlier, are the use of salt, gold dust, precious metals, shells, etc. This relies on tangible objects and is natural for all humans.  


<!-- 3. Morality-based

This relies on the sense of morals that are defined by an authority. An example is the ayni system of the Inca which uses quipu strings for valuation and exchange. This requires training for the users and can only happen in well-knit societies.    -->


The current economic system, just like blockchain, is trust-based since fiat money is not backed by any commodity. This is why it can crash spectacularly. 

Our solution is a hybrid system, using both trust and commodities. 
- The trust manifests as a general and a bilateral credit score
- THe commodity is based on the common grain food of the people

<!-- Supereconomics is based on sustainability and so we will discuss this extensively, specifically as a points-based system similar to the Incan. -->
