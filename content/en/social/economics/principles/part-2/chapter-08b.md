A business needs resources for 2 purposes:

1. Capital

Capital resources are the fixed assets, machines, equipment, buildings, intellectual property, etc. This is realized by fixed capital.

2. Operations

Operational resources are the wages for the employees, supplies, utilities, etc. This is realized by circulating capital.

In the economic system:
- fixed capital is usually addressed by investment banking and venture capitalists through investments
- circulating capital is usually addressed by commercial banking through loans
