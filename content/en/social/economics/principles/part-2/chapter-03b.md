The effort theory of value says that useful work or effort is the foundation of exchangeable value. 

<!--  one of the foundations of Superphysics and is based entirely on Adam Smith’s [Effort Theory of Value](/social/economics/principles/effort-theory-of-value).  -->

This is totally different from Economics and Mercantilism which uses money as the basis, through marginal pricing theory.

Since effort is very important, its definition becomes very important. 

Supereconomics defines defines human effort, whether physical or mental, as ultimately being rooted in psychological or metaphysical toil and trouble.
- This is opposite of the labor theory of value from Karl Marx which is based on physical work. 

Exchangeable Effort is the effort used with or on capital to create exchangeable value. 

We classify this into six:

<!-- Next, we will categorize effort according to Smith’s system of productive and unproductive labor, which he seems to have gotten from the Physiocrats. 

He defines:
- productive labor as that which produces some vendible commodity
- unproductive labor as something that does not produce anything vendible. 

This definition was later frowned upon by writers such as Jean Baptiste Say, who did not like the name ‘unproductive labor’ being applied to statesmen, singers, doctors, and people who render services.

This is why we classify work into six categories. -->


## 1-2. Persistence: Material and Immaterial Effort

This uses the 1st Law to assign value based on its persistence in Reality. It refers to the physicality of the end result:

1. Material effort is that which produces a material thing.  

Included here are manufacturing, processing, agriculture, processing, extraction, etc.

2. Immaterial effort is that which produces a material thing. 

This includes services, events, experiences, etc.

Examples are healthcare, education, entertainment, government.

<!-- - unproductive labour is called 
- productive labour is '' or 'agriculture'

To make the naming systematic, we use [the First Law of Value](/social/economics/principles/part-1/chapter-01) to replace them with Material and Immaterial Effort: -->

<!-- #### Material Effort produces something that can be bound by a specific space and time, manifesting as a thing or object. -->


{{< q a="Smith" c="The Wealth Of Nations Simplified, Book 2, Chapter 3" >}}
The gravest, most important, and some of the most frivolous professions are unproductive: Churchmen, Lawyers, Physicians, all Men of letters, Players, buffoons, musicians, opera-singers, opera-dancers, etc. Their labour has a certain value regulated by the same principles which regulate other kinds of labour.
{{< /q >}}


<!-- #### Immaterial Effort produces something that cannot be bound by a specific space and time, manifesting as a service or project such as an event or experience -->

In a concert:
- the effort of the singer, stage crew, organizers are the immaterial effort
- the tickets, souvenirs, recordings, and merchandies are the material effort
- an MP3 file of the concert is a material effort
- a stream of the concert is an immaterial effort

<!-- effort in setting up the lighting and sound systems, are immaterial effort. The revenue for them is realized through the sales of tickets which is the material effort.  -->

## 3-4. Skill: Skilled and Unskilled Effort

This uses the Second Law of Value to classify effort as skilled or unskilled, according to the relativistic real values of their outputs.


3. Skilled Effort requires many years of training and education

Examples are:
- 3-star chefs
- Professional athletes or Olympians 
- Engineers, Doctors, and Industrial farmers


4. Unskilled Effort requires little training and education.

Examples are:
- Ordinary cooks in households and community eateries 
- Amateur sportsmen
- Construction workers, caregivers, and small-scale farmers

Generally, a wealthy country will be able to support more skilled effort than unskilled ones.

For example, Olympic medals are a good metric that indicates national wealth because athletes are skilled effort, as compared to amateurs.

<!-- cap="In Supereconomics, amateur players are unskilled effort or work" -->

<!-- We also add useful or useless effort 
- Useful effort has a high natural price. Examples are:
- Useless effort has a low natural price. Examples are:
 -->


## 5-6. Creativity: Value-adding and Value-Maintaining

Lastly, we use the Fourth Law to classify effort as value-adding or value-maintaing.

- Creativity is the beginning of production
- Productivity is the end of production

Both creativity and productivity are measured through quality and quantity. 



5. Value-adding effort creates or adds new value.

Examples are: 
- Manufacturers, farmers, miners, construction, utilities, recyclers, innovators, successful writers and scientific discoveries


6. Value-maintaining effort maintains the value already created. 

Adam Smith calls these unproductive labor. Examples are:
- Governments, Militaries, Security personnel, Reporters, Lawyers, Lawmakers, Finance and Insurance

It can be easily noticed how government workers are generally uncreative. This is because government is a system that involves routine work.  


A wealthy country will have more value-adders than value-maintainers. This is why liberals often push for small governments. 

A country can become poor if its maintainers turn into rent-seekers that cannibalize the value-adders:

Phenomena | Examples 
--- | ---
Military Dictatorship | Cuba, North Korea, Myanmar, and Venezuela
State Religion | Saudi Arabia, Brunei, Iran, and Aceh
Conservative Tradition | China under Mao, Tibet, and Vietnam

These stifle the creation and increase of material wealth for the sake of some abstract ideology. 

{{< i s="/photos/countries/nk/parade.jpg" a="Soldiers marching" c="Countries with too much value-maintaining military relative to value-adding industry or agriculture tend to be poorer unless they can invade  " >}}

Value-maintaining military can be converted to value-adding if it used for conquest. This was done by the Roman Empire and European Colonization.

<!-- - This happens most obviously in military dictatorships. An example is 
- This also can happen in countries that adopt state religions which stifle value-creation. Examples are .
- It sometimes can happen in traditional or unprogressive states. Examples are . -->

<!--  since the military values its effort more because they put their own lives at risk. 
cap="The military's work is a value-maintaining effort. Weapons manufacture is value-adding if it leads to new technologies for non-military applications" -->

With this, we can classify any profession easily according to these 6 types of effort:

Effort | Persistence | Skill | Creativity
--- | --- | --- | ---
Nursing | {{< color color="dodgerblue" val="Immaterial" >}} | {{< color val="Skilled" >}} | {{< color color="dodgerblue" val="Maintaining" >}}  
Banking and Finance | {{< color color="dodgerblue" val="Immaterial" >}} | {{< color val="Skilled" >}} | {{< color color="dodgerblue" val="Maintaining" >}}
Singers | {{< color color="dodgerblue" val="Immaterial" >}} | {{< color color="orange" val="Unskilled" >}} | {{< color color="dodgerblue" val="Maintaining" >}}
Professional Athletes | {{< color color="dodgerblue" val="Immaterial" >}} | {{< color val="Skilled" >}} | {{< color color="dodgerblue" val="Maintaining" >}}
Cooks | {{< color color="dodgerblue" val="Immaterial" >}} | {{< color color="orange" val="Unskilled" >}} | {{< color val="Adding" >}}
Content writing | {{< color color="dodgerblue" val="Immaterial" >}} | {{< color color="orange" val="Unskilled" >}} | {{< color val="Adding" >}}
Manufacture of Microchips | {{< color val="Material" >}} | {{< color val="Skilled" >}} | {{< color val="Adding" >}}
Rice Farming | {{< color val="Material" >}} | {{< color color="orange" val="Unskilled" >}} | {{< color val="Adding" >}}


Supereconomics aims to:
- balance the immaterial and material efforts
- increase effort to become skilled
- increase the efficiency of value-maintaining effort so that more effort can go to value-creation or addition

This classification system allows our supereconomy to be automated in order to further reduce the value-maintaining effort. It can also make taxation much fairer.


A rich country can use its skilled labor to code the AI that can be used by poor countries to help them rise to wealth faster, bypassing the usual corrupt rent-seekers that made them poor in the first place.
