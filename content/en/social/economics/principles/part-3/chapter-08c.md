Sometimes, the circulation of value in an economy is hampered by either man-made or natural causes. 

Examples of man-made causes are trade wars, concentration of wealth, and conflict.

Examples of natural causes are natural disasters such as pandemics, droughts, and earthquakes.

In such cases, the government needs to step in and spend to jumpstart the economy. 

Unlike the economic system that can only spend money (and thus keep the financial industry employed), supereconomic allows moneyless spending through barter-credits.
