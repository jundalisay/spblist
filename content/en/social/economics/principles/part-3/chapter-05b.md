Air and water are the 2 human needs that are of highest temporal importance. 

Clean air is provided by trees and plants, which like humans, need water and land to grow on. 

Therefore, we can combine agriculture, forestry, and water policy.  

<!-- Aside from water, electricity and telecommunications, food is an essential minimum requirement for modern humans.  -->

<!-- The lockdowns during Covid and the war between Russia and Ukraine have caused food to be inaccessible and food prices to increase. 

This has led to nutrition deficiency among the poor, as well as slow growth in the food service and food processing industry.  -->

<!-- Are Caused by  Inflation Proves Market Liberalization is Flawed -->



## Agricultural Supereconomics

Global warming, conflict, and for-profit market forces have pushed hunger and malnutrition to new heights. 

The desire for profits causes the destruction of forests which are supposed to absorb CO2 emissions. 
- The increase in CO2 makes droughts and typhoons more severe. 
- This hurts agriculture which then raises food prices. 

Agriculture Supereconomics integrates the other fields of Superhysics to tackle this problem, under the 4 Laws of Value:

<!-- Agricultural Supereconomics applies the Four Laws of Supereconomics onto agriculture.  -->

1. Bio Superphysics deals with human nutrition and crop/animal health
2. Supersociology deals with the motivation and mobilization mechanisms for society
3. Material Superphysics deals with the physical forces such as sun, rain, and wind

This is very different from Agriculture Economics which only deals with market prices and supply and demand of agricultural products



## Water Policy

This deals with:
- the building of water sources
- the transport and storage of water
- the disposal of waste water 
- flood and sea control 

In the short term, this might be connected to the energy policy as hydroelectric dams or underwater turbines. 

However, Material Superphysics aims to ddiscover new and reliable energy sources:
- nuclear fusion
- antimatter power
- spacetime energy

And so this power generation from water might not be so relevant in the future.

As a principle, subterranean water should not be used for irrigation purposes. Subterranean water should not be disturbed, otherwise the level of the water-table will drop, leading to an acute shortage of water. 

The best system is to collect surface water. 

Rainwater should be collected where it falls. 

If the huge reserves of water under some deserts are harnessed, it may do more harm than good. It is always better to conserve surface water.


### Ancestral Domain

The most common problem with building dams is the destruction of natural habits and indigenous territories. 



<!-- ### Food Crises From Market Forces

The current economic system is unable to prevent hunger because it relies on market forces. 

According to the doctrine of free markets, the inflation of food prices should attract capital to either food production or food distribution in order to create competition and reduce prices. 

However, in reality, additional capital merely gravitates and pools around the monopolistic causes of the inflation -- the big agribusinesses and big distributors, which we will call the 'whales'. 

The whales then probe the limits of the market and the government by playing with prices until they find a sustainable high price that is very advantageous to them, yet not extremely oppressive as to create a revolution or change in policy.

In the case of the Philippines, the whales chose to strike early at the start of the term of the new President who has a 6-year term, starting on June 30, 2022. 

In this way, they will have high revenues for 6 years unless the government is changed by a coup or revolution. 

Accordingly, the threat of a military destabilization cropped up after just 6 months in the second week of January 2023. 


## Solution: A New Agricultural Paradigm

To solve the problems caused by market forces in agriculture, we introduce a new paradigm called *Maximized Agriculture* which implements the principles of *Agricultural Supereconomics*.  -->
