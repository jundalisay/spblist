<!-- For the past few months, we have been testing the operations of our proposed points-based economic system.  -->

Businesses use financial ratios such as:
- current ratio (to measure current assets versus current liabilities)
- return-on-investment (net income versus investment)

Supereconomics also uses ratios, broadly classified under Demand, Capital, Industry, and Trade, representing the Four Laws. 


## Small-Scale Ratios

These are for personal transactions that involve a small population size. 

Demand | Realization Ratio
--- | ---
Capital | Average Time to Realize
Industry | Goods-Service Ratio
Trade | Transaction Usefulness Ratio



### Realization Ratio

This is the ratio of the actual realized points versus the total points. 

```elixir
Realized Points / Total Net Points 
```

### Average Time to Realize  

This is the average time that it takes to realize a point from the time when that point was created or given. 

```elixir
AVE(Time of Point Debit - Time of Point Credit) 
```

### Goods to Services Ratio  

This is the ratio of goods exchanged for services. In the large scale, this will be useful to determine whether infrastructure should be allocated for bulk transport (freight) or for personal transport (passengers), or for services or manufacturing and agriculture. 

```elixir
Points from Goods / Points from Services
```


### Transaction Usefulness Ratio

This is the number of transaction instances that were realized, relative to the total number of transactions done. 


```elixir
Realized Transaction Instances / Total Number of Transactions Done 
```


## Large-Scale Ratios

These are fo transactions that involve a large population size such as a nation or the world

Demand | Population : Needs
--- | ---
Capital | Investment : Returns
Industry | Real Value : Projected Value
Trade | Pool Deficit : Pool Surplus

<!-- 1.  Population Size versus Minimum Needs
2.  Investments versus Returns 
3.  Realized Value versus Projected Value
4.  Pool Deficit versus Pool Surplus (of Pool Clearing) -->



<!-- The following ratios determine the useful productivity of the users of our points-based system just as capitalism has ratios such as Earning per Share, ROI, Return on Assets, etc.  -->
