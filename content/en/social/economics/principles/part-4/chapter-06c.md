The dominance of mercantilism and the rule of money in Europe led to the corruption of the Political Economy through the creation of microeconomics.

Political Economy had the interests of the whole society in mind. Microecnomics only had the interests of the businesses and investors.

Microeconomics was later supported by Macroeconomics from Keynes who enshrined the love of money. This led to the dominance of state-controlled interest rates through the financial system as a means to control the economy.

The problem with the financial system is that it is not based on anything real. Instead, it is based on the fluctuating feelings of people. Human feelings follow a template based on a person's position in space-time. 

This is why investing and speculating, though inherently random, can be influenced by marketing and propaganda. 


### The Asian Crisis: Deregulation Leading to Currency Speculation

The propaganda in the 1990s was liberalization. This was because the Soviet Union fell in 1991 and there were new opportunities for money-making.

The ex-Soviet countries still needed 2 decades to change their mentality to be worthy of investments. But Southeast Asia was now free from the Communist wave. 

So the IMF pushed Southeast Asia to liberalize their financial industry to allow the entry of foreign invvestments. 

- In Singapore, this led to a new round of infrastructure development
- In the Philippines, this began a new wave of privatizations
- In Thailand, this opened up the country to investments, expats, and tourism
- In Indonesia, this led to new economic development in Jakarta
- In Korea, foreign ownership was increased

<!-- The Asian Crisis was caused by the liberalization agenda pushed by , part of which was opening up of FDI. Here is a paper that proves how open FDI added to that crisis: -->

"Regarding capital account liberalization, the [Korean] Government increased the ceiling on aggregate foreign ownership of listed shares from 26 to 55 percent and eliminated the ceiling completely by end-1998, and raised individual foreign ownership from 7 to 50 percent"

"The [Korean] Government originally encouraged the entry of foreign banks mainly to promote the inflow of foreign capital"
{{< /q >}}


The problem was that the financial deregulation caused too much speculative inflow -- there was a lot of command of work, without work being done.

The sudden inflows distorted the real currency values. This scheme was perfected by George Soros earlier in 1992 as Black Wednesday by attacking the British pound.

This began with the Thai baht and then with the Malaysian ringgit. The Philippine peso was also affected to a lesser degree. 

In contrast, the Singapore dollar was already expensive and Vietnamese dong was state-controlled so these currencies were not so much affected. 

So the Asian Crisis was a flawed deregulation that led to currency attacks. It is the Black Wednesday for Asia. 


<!-- This lack of returns caused capital flight product 

This matches the observation of another paper ("Lending Booms, Real Estate Bubbles, The Asian Crisis") which has the following policy recommendations: 

"Capital Account Liberalization must be carefully phased in, in line with domestic regulation. Some observers recommend a more restrictive approach to debt flows...Policy [should control] the property sector to moderate price movements. Singapore followed this route in 1996, increasing land taxes..thus helping deflate land prices"

So Singapore did the fiscal approach to mitigate the Asian Crisis while the PH did the constitutional restriction approach.  -->

Unlike the 2008 Financial Crisis which had many warnings, the 1997 crisis took many by surprise. 

<!-- I remember that there was a boom just in 1995 when ASEAN leaders met and said that the regional economy was very good. By 1997 the dean of our school system went to my high school to talk about exchange rates and why the Thai Baht was affecting the Philipoie economy. His explanation was that ever currency had to be devalued to match that of Thailand. -->

The Asian Crisis caused:
- currency controls in Malaysia
- the rise of Thaksin in Thailand
- the closure of many companies in Korea 
- the fall of Estrada in the Philippines
- riots in Indonesia and the fall of Suharto

 
<!-- Foreign investors were allowed to invest directly in Korean stocks in 1992, subject to a general ceiling on total foreign holdings of any one companyâ€™s outstanding shares. The ceiling was raised several times until it reached 55 percent at end-1997, and it was finally abolished by end-1998, according to the IMF program. -->
