## Oligarchy

In Socrates' Law of Social Cycles, the Oligarchy follows after the Aristocratic cycle. 

Contrary to popular belief, Oligarchy is the rule by money, not the rule by a few. This is because the  aristocratic cycle is also ruled by a few people.

The main driver of an oligarchy is the need for wealth and economic growth. 

There are 2 main subforms of Oligarchy today.


### 1. Technocracy

A technocracy is the rule by experts. 

This can be seen as a modern Timocracy, which is the sub-cycle in between an aristocracy and an oligarchy. 

According to Socrates, this happens when the philosophers become steadily drawn by the love of money. And so they use their expert skills to make money.  

The moderm philosophers are now scientists, engineers, economists, etc.

These are like private consultants who are hired to solve specific problems that require specialized knowledge.

Technocrats believe that governance should be guided by scientific principles and data-driven policies rather than by political ideologies or popular opinion.

<!--    - **Focus on Efficiency and Rationality**: Technocracy aims to optimize societal organization based on rational, evidence-based decision-making. It is rooted in the belief that experts can make better policy decisions than politicians because they are better equipped to understand complex systems.
   - **Economic Planning**:  -->

Technocrats often advocate for **centralized economic planning** that is guided by data and expertise.
- This includes managing resources, production, and distribution to ensure efficiency and sustainability.



### 2. Neoliberalism 


Neoliberalism emerged from the Bretton Woods system established after the end of World War 2.

Instead of managing the world through a council such as the League of Nations or the United Nations, the strategy changed to using Economics through the following economic institutions:

1. The World Bank 

This provided loans for capital expenditures such as infrastructure and power plants. 

2. The IMF

This provided financing for government services and operating costs and non capital expenses. 

3. World Trade Organization

This set the rules for world trade. 


#### Free Markets and Deregulation

Instead of competing through destructive warfare, nations agreed to compete in terms of goods and services.

This required deregulation and the opening up of markets, including the privatization of state-owned enterprises.

The resulting global free trade was called globalization. This included the free movement of capital, goods, and services across borders, which often leads to reduced tariffs and trade barriers.

Instead of state solutions, the burden of solving problems fell to companies which were tasked with providing market-driven solutions. This is based on the belief that the market can solve social issues (e.g., healthcare, education) better than government intervention.


<!--    - **Economic Characteristics**:
     - **Privatization** of government-run businesses and services.
     - **Deregulation** of industries, allowing businesses to operate with minimal government intervention.
     - **Lower Taxes**: Often calls for lower taxes, especially on businesses and wealthier individuals, to stimulate investment.
     - **Reduced Welfare**: Neoliberalism tends to advocate for **reduced government spending** on welfare programs, focusing on market-based solutions. -->

Examples of neoliberalism are the policies implemented by Margaret Thatcher's UK, Ronald Reagan's USA

<!-- **, and in many international organizations like the **IMF** and **World Bank**. -->



<!-- ### 1. **Neoliberalism**
   - **Core Ideas**:
     - **Market-Oriented Reforms**: Neoliberalism is an economic and political ideology that promotes **free markets**, **minimal state intervention**, and **privatization** of state-owned enterprises. It advocates for reducing the role of the state in economic affairs and promoting policies that encourage competition and market efficiency.
     - **Globalization**: Neoliberalism supports the **globalization** of trade, including **free trade agreements**, **deregulation**, and the **free movement of capital** across borders.
     - **Reduced Government**: While neoliberalism doesn't necessarily advocate for the abolition of government, it calls for **limited government intervention**â€”primarily focusing on providing a stable legal framework, enforcing property rights, and ensuring national security.
     - **Individual Responsibility**: Neoliberalism places emphasis on **individual responsibility** over state-provided welfare, encouraging citizens to rely on the market and their own initiative for economic success.

   - **Economic Characteristics**:
     - **Privatization**: Neoliberal policies often lead to the **privatization** of public services and assets.
     - **Deregulation**: The removal or reduction of governmental regulations in sectors like finance, labor, and trade.
     - **Free Market Capitalism**: Neoliberalism strongly supports capitalism, with minimal constraints, allowing market forces to drive competition and innovation.
     - **Welfare Reduction**: Neoliberalism tends to reduce social safety nets, focusing instead on encouraging private solutions for issues like healthcare, education, and pensions.

   - **Key Figures**: 
     - **Milton Friedman**, **Ronald Reagan**, and **Margaret Thatcher** are often associated with the promotion and implementation of neoliberal economic policies. -->
   
<!-- ### **Comparison of Libertarianism, Liberalism, Oligarchy, and Technocracy**

| **Aspect**                  | **Libertarianism**                          | **Liberalism**                              | **Oligarchy**                               | **Technocracy**                             |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Role of Government**       | **Minimal**: Focus on protecting individual rights, with limited functions (e.g., law enforcement, defense). | **Varies**: Classical liberalism advocates for limited government; social liberalism supports a larger role in welfare and regulation. | **Concentrated**: Power is held by a small group of elites. The state is controlled by this group for their interests. | **Expert-driven**: Government is run by specialists who make decisions based on technical expertise. |
| **Economic System**          | **Free-market capitalism** with minimal regulation or interference. | **Mixed economy**: Support for both free markets and government intervention (e.g., welfare, regulation). | **Economic control by elites**: Wealth and resources are controlled by the ruling group, leading to inequality. | **Centralized economic planning**: Economic decisions are made by experts to maximize efficiency and productivity. |
| **Social Equality**          | **Minimal**: Focus on equality of opportunity rather than outcomes; supports a meritocratic system. | **Emphasis on equality of outcomes**: Advocates for redistribution of wealth and opportunities to ensure fairness. | **Highly unequal**: Power and wealth are concentrated among a small elite, leading to systemic inequality. | **Efficiency over equality**: Social and economic decisions are made for the greatest benefit based on expertise, though inequality may arise depending on the system. |
| **Power Distribution**       | **Decentralized**: Emphasis on individual autonomy, personal freedom, and decentralization of power. | **Democratic**: Power rests with the people, often mediated through elected representatives and institutions. | **Centralized**: Power is concentrated in the hands of a small elite group. | **Centralized in experts**: Decision-making is concentrated in the hands of specialized experts and technocrats. |
| **Political Participation**  | **Direct or minimal**: Advocates for individual autonomy and voluntary association, with minimal political intervention. | **Representative democracy**: Individuals participate through elections and voting for political representatives. | **Limited**: Political participation is often restricted or manipulated by the ruling elite. | **Limited**: Public participation is often reduced to consulting experts, with little direct influence on decision-making. |
| **Governance Principle**     | **Non-aggression** and **individual liberty**. | **Individual rights** and **social justice**. | **Rule by a small, powerful group**. | **Efficiency and rationality** based on expert knowledge. |

### **Key Differences**:

1. **Role of Government**:
   - **Libertarianism** and **Liberalism** both support the idea of a limited government but differ in the extent to which the government should intervene in the economy or social issues. Libertarianism advocates for **minimal government intervention**, while liberalism, especially in its **social** form, supports a more active role in addressing social inequalities and welfare.
   - **Oligarchy** and **Technocracy**, on the other hand, have more centralized forms of governance. In an oligarchy, power is concentrated among a few elites, and the government is run for their benefit. In a technocracy, decision-making is centralized in the hands of experts to achieve efficiency and rationality.

2. **Economic System**:
   - **Libertarianism** advocates for a **pure free-market economy** with no government regulation. **Liberalism** supports a more balanced approach, with a combination of **free markets** and **government regulation** to ensure fairness and protect citizens.
   - **Oligarchies** control the economy through elite monopolies and wealth, leading to high inequality, whereas **technocracies** may support **centralized economic planning**, guided by data and experts, with the aim of maximizing efficiency and productivity.

3. **Social Equality**:
   - **Libertarianism** focuses on **equality of opportunity**, not outcome, and believes that individuals should be free to pursue their own success.
   - **Liberalism** places a higher emphasis on **social justice** and redistribution to ensure **equality of outcomes**.
   - **Oligarchy** results in **inequality**, as power and resources are controlled by the elite. **Technocracy**, while focusing on efficiency, may still result in inequality if experts and elites dominate decision-making processes.

4. **Political Participation**:
   - **Libertarianism** favors minimal state involvement and prefers a system where individuals govern their own lives.
   - **Liberalism** emphasizes **democracy** and participation through voting and political representation.
   - **Oligarchy** limits participation to a small group, while **Technocracy** restricts political participation to **expert decision-making**. -->


<!-- ### **Conclusion**:
In summary, **Libertarianism** and **Liberalism** are political philosophies that focus on governance through individual rights, with Libertarianism pushing for minimal government and Liberalism advocating for a balance between free markets and social safety nets. **Oligarchy** is a governance system where power is concentrated in the hands of a few elites, often leading to inequality, while **Technocracy** is a system in which decision-making is led by experts in various fields, focusing on efficiency and data-driven solutions. While **Libertarianism** and **Liberalism** are philosophies that guide political structures, **Oligarchy** and **Technocracy** represent forms of governance that can be implemented within various systems. -->
