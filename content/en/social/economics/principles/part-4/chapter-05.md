## The Financial System

The dominance of money led to the development of:
- central banks as the wholesalers of money 
- commercial banks as the retailers

These retailers now come in many forms as investment banks, development banks, thrift banks, rural banks, unibanks, finance cooperatives, etc. 


## The Barter System

The dominance of money led to the fall of the barter system through the European colonial system.
