Traders get revenue from circulating goods and services of which they get a cut from each transaction. 

This is why they want as much freedom as possible so that there would be as much circulation as possible. 

They disregard the evils of overcirculation just as Warriors disregard the evils of undercirculation. 

This commonly leads to 
The dominance of traders and 


The Mercantile Period of the 17th century and Capitalist Period of the 19th century led to the ideologies of Liberalism and Libertarianism.



## Liberalism

Liberalism came as an effect of Mercantilism.

Foreign trade brought a lot of wealth to Europe, creating a sense of empowerment and desire for freedom. Prior to this, the Church was dominant and imposed modestry, austerity, and frugality.  

The increase in sensory desires led to the fall of the Church through the French Revolution which separated the Church from the State. 

From that time onwards, the austere policy was abandoned in favor of wealth and economic growth.

The main proponents of liberalism are:

1. John Locke (1632–1704)

His writings on natural rights, including life, liberty, and property, are central to liberal thought.

He argued that individuals have inalienable rights and that government exists to protect these rights, with its power being derived from the consent of the governed.

Locke's social contract theory greatly influenced liberal democratic thought and the principles of limited government, equality, and individual freedom.

2. Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778)

 <!-- - While Rousseau is sometimes considered more associated with democratic theory and republicanism, his ideas on the **general will** and **popular sovereignty** influenced the liberal tradition of thought. -->

He also pushed for a social contract theory, as well as corporate organization. 



## Libertarianism

Libertarianism emerged with the strengthening of Capitalism in the 19th and 20th centuries. 

We put the main proponent of this as Ayn Rand who was able to influence many people through her novel, *Atlas Shrugged* and *The Fountainhead*. 

  - **Emphasis on Individual Freedom**: Libertarianism is a political philosophy that prioritizes **individual liberty** and autonomy. It advocates for minimal government intervention in both personal lives and the economy.
     - **Minimal Government**: Libertarians argue for a **minimal state**—often referred to as a **night-watchman state**—which is primarily concerned with protecting individuals' rights (e.g., property rights, personal safety, and freedom of speech). The government’s role should be restricted to law enforcement, national defense, and the judicial system.
     - **Free Markets**: Libertarianism supports **free-market capitalism**, advocating for voluntary exchange without government regulation, taxation, or redistribution.
     - **Non-Aggression Principle**: Libertarians believe that the initiation of force is inherently wrong and that individuals should interact voluntarily and peacefully.

<!--    - **Key Principles**:
     - **Private property rights**
     - **Freedom of choice**
     - **Self-ownership**
     - **Non-interventionist policies** -->

### Objectivism

This is a philosophical system from Russian Ayn Rand based on individualism -- the belief that individuals have the right to pursue their own happiness and self-interest without interference from others, including the state.

Objectivism believes that rational self-interest should guide human actions. It emphasizes the importance of:
- reason
- individual rights
- the pursuit of one’s own happiness

We put this under the 4th Law because it happens twards the end of the Trader Cycle where the lack of spiritual knowledge causes the mind to go further into freedom and material desires. 

To satisfy more desires, it pushes for liberty. 

Objectivism advocates for a **laissez-faire capitalist** society, where the government’s role is limited to protecting individual rights—specifically, protecting people’s property and ensuring the enforcement of contracts. and national defense.

Rand argued that capitalism is the only moral social system because it respects individual rights and allows people to pursue their own happiness.

<!-- - **Ethics of Rational Self-Interest**: Objectivism is grounded in an ethical theory of **rational self-interest**, where the pursuit of one's own happiness is considered the highest moral purpose. This contrasts with altruistic ideologies that prioritize the well-being of others over the individual’s own desires. -->

It rejects altruism or the moral doctrine that individuals have a duty to serve the needs of others. This is because it sees altruism as a form of self-sacrifice that undermines human flourishing.

There are no taxes, no regulation of business, and no welfare systems.

Objectivism strongly defends **private property** and the right of individuals to freely engage in commerce, accumulate wealth, and keep the fruits of their labor.

Objectivism argues that individuals should engage in **voluntary, mutually beneficial exchanges** in the marketplace, driven by rational self-interest.


<!-- 1. **John Locke** (1632–1704) - As with liberalism, Locke's ideas on **natural rights** (life, liberty, and property) and the limited role of government laid the groundwork for **libertarian principles**, especially his emphasis on the protection of individual freedom and the non-aggression principle.

2. **Murray Rothbard** (1926–1995) - Often considered the **founder of modern libertarianism**:
   - Rothbard, an economist and political theorist, advanced the **anarcho-capitalist** form of libertarianism. His work emphasized the **absolute rights of the individual**, advocating for a stateless society where private property and voluntary exchange govern all interactions.
   - His book, *Man, Economy, and State* (1962), and his role in the **Austrian School of Economics** played a major role in developing the libertarian tradition of **free-market capitalism** and **minimal government intervention**. -->

<!-- 3. **Ayn Rand** (1905–1982) - While not always considered a "classic" libertarian (since she advocated for a minimal government), her **Objectivist philosophy** has significantly influenced libertarian thought, particularly her defense of **rational self-interest** and **capitalism**. She is well-known for her books *Atlas Shrugged* and *The Fountainhead*.

4. **Friedrich Hayek** (1899–1992) - While primarily an economist, Hayek’s work on the dangers of central planning and his advocacy for **limited government** and **individual liberty** made him a key intellectual influence on modern libertarian thought. His book, *The Road to Serfdom* (1944), critiqued socialist and interventionist policies, arguing that they would lead to totalitarianism and the erosion of individual freedoms. -->

|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Philosophical Basis**      | Focuses on **market efficiency**, limited government, and individual responsibility. | A complete **philosophy** based on **rational self-interest**, individual rights, and laissez-faire capitalism. |
| **Role of Government**       | Advocates for a **minimal government**, but allows for some regulation and intervention in certain sectors (e.g., security, education). | Advocates for a **minimal government** whose only role is to protect individual rights (property rights, enforcing contracts, national defense). |
| **Economic System**          | Supports **market-oriented capitalism** with some degree of state intervention, such as privatization and deregulation. | Advocates for **laissez-faire capitalism**, with no government intervention in the economy. |
| **Welfare and Redistribution** | **Opposes** state-run welfare programs, encourages private solutions. | **Rejects** all forms of welfare or redistribution, emphasizing personal responsibility and voluntary charity. |
| **Individual Rights**        | Supports **individual freedom** but within a framework of competitive markets and state regulation to maintain stability. | Central to Objectivism; **individual rights** (including property rights) are paramount, with no compromise for collective or altruistic goals. |
| **View on Altruism**         | Generally **neutral or dismissive** of state-sponsored altruism (e.g., welfare programs), but may accept some government support for the disadvantaged. | **Strongly rejects altruism** as a moral doctrine and holds that individuals should act for their own rational self-interest. |
| **Globalization**            | Supports **global trade** and open markets as part of economic efficiency and competition. | Supports **free trade** but places less emphasis on globalization per se—focus is on individual rights and economic freedom. |
| **Examples of Policy**       | **Reaganomics**, **Thatcherism**, **World Bank** reforms promoting free markets, privatization, and deregulation. | **Ayn Rand’s philosophy** often advocated for minimal government involvement and a purely **free market system** without government interference. |


1. **Philosophical Foundation**:  
   - Neoliberalism is primarily an **economic and political theory** focused on promoting free markets, deregulation, and limited government intervention in the economy.  
   - Objectivism, on the other hand, is a **comprehensive philosophy** that encompasses ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, and politics. It emphasizes **individualism** and rational self-interest as the guiding principles of human life and society.

2. **Government's Role**:  
   - Neoliberalism supports a **minimal government**, but it often allows for some form of state regulation (e.g., infrastructure, welfare, market rules) to ensure stability.  
   - Objectivism advocates for an even **smaller government**, limited to only the protection of individual rights through the **military**, **police**, and **courts**. It believes that the government should not interfere in any other aspect of life or the economy.

3. **Welfare**:  
   - Neoliberalism seeks to **reduce or privatize welfare** programs but does not advocate for their complete abolition. It encourages market-based solutions to social problems.  
   - Objectivism **completely rejects welfare** programs and sees them as a form of coercion that violates individual rights. It advocates for voluntary charity, but not as a moral duty.

4. **Market Regulation**:  
   - Neoliberalism allows for some **market regulation** to ensure competition and prevent abuses (e.g., antitrust laws, environmental protections).  
   - Objectivism, in contrast, argues for **no government regulation** in markets, insisting that voluntary transactions and competition should be entirely unrestricted.

### **Conclusion**:
While **Neoliberalism** and **Objectivism** share some common ground in their support for **free-market capitalism** and **individual freedom**, they differ significantly in their underlying philosophical principles and approaches to government intervention. Neoliberalism is more pragmatic and focused on economic policies to manage market efficiency, while Objectivism is a **comprehensive philosophy** that demands a very limited government with an ethical foundation rooted in **rational self-interest**. Objectivism advocates for a purely **laissez-faire capitalist society**, with **no government interference** in the economy or personal lives, whereas Neoliberalism permits some level of government action if it facilitates economic growth and competition. -->
