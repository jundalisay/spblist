A Ponzi scheme is a type of investment scam that affects the Worker Class because of its attractive and easy appearances. 

It promises high returns with little or no risk to investors.

Instead of generating profits through legitimate investments or business activities, the scheme uses money from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors.

The usual ingredients for this kind of scam are:

- The ponzi operator attracts new investors with promises of high returns, often much higher than normal investments like stocks or bonds
- Early investors receive the promised returns, which are actually paid from the money contributed by newer investors, not from profits generated by the investments
- To keep the scheme running, the operator needs to continually recruit new investors to deposit money which will be used to pay returns to earlier investors

Eventually, the scheme collapses when the operator:
- can no longer recruit enough new investors.
- runs off with the remaining funds.

<!-- Key Features:
No real investment: There’s no legitimate underlying business or investments generating profits.
Sustainability issues: The scheme is unsustainable in the long term, as it requires a constant influx of new investors to continue operating.
Collapse: When the flow of new investment slows down or when the operator absconds with the funds, the scheme collapses, and most investors lose their money. -->

### History of the Ponzi Scheme

It is named after Charles Ponzi, an Italian-born swindler who became infamous for starting this scam in 1919 in the United States.
- He promised high returns at 50% profit in 45 days by arbitrage in international postal reply coupons.
- He claimed that he could buy these coupons cheaply in one country and redeem them for a higher value in another country.

But Ponzi was really using money from new investors to pay the returns of earlier investors.

Ponzi’s scheme attracted millions of dollars, and at its peak, he was taking in an estimated $250,000 per day (equivalent to about $3.5 million today).

However, when investigative journalists and regulators began looking into his activities, it was revealed that there were no legitimate investments. 

Ponzi was arrested, and his scheme collapsed, leaving most investors with nothing.

<!-- Before Ponzi:

Although Ponzi is the most famous example, fraudulent schemes of a similar nature existed before his time. Early instances of these types of scams were recorded as far back as the 19th century in both Europe and the United States.
For example, in the 1880s, a man named William "Billy" Walters conducted a similar scam, and the practice had been seen in various forms in fraudulent investment schemes throughout history. -->

### Modern Ponzi Schemes

<!-- Since Ponzi’s exposure, his name has been used to describe any scheme that operates on a similar principle of using new investors’ money to pay returns to older investors.
Ponzi schemes have continued to appear throughout history, with notable examples like  -->

Bernie Madoff's scheme in the early 2000s is a major Ponzi scheme which defrauded investors of billions of dollars.

Other more common examples are cryptocurrency scams and multilevel marketing (MLM) schemes.

<!-- With the rise of digital currencies and unregulated investment platforms, Ponzi schemes continue to be a significant risk for unsophisticated investors.
Legal and Financial Impact:
Ponzi schemes are illegal in most countries and are punishable by law.
They can cause massive financial harm to individuals, as the majority of the investors who get involved near the end of the scheme lose their money, while those who entered earlier may walk away with some or all of their original investments.
In summary, Ponzi schemes prey on the desire for high returns with low risk, but because they rely on the constant influx of new money to function, they are inherently unsustainable and fraudulent. -->
