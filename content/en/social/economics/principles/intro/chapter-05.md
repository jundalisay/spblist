Supereconomics classifies value into buyer-seller, and personal-societal, leading to 4 kinds of value.

Supereconomics | Personal | Society
--- | --- | ---
Subjective and Variable (Buyer's perspective) | **Nominal Price** (value in currency) | **Market Price** (value to the buyer)
Objective and Natural or Invariable (Seller's perspective) | **Real Price** (value in grain or labour) | **Natural Price** (value to the seller)


Economics, on the other hand, has no concept of Real and Natural Price because it has no concept of society as an objective entity.  
- It purposely rejects the importance of society because it enshrines selfishness, as a result of being dominated by the Negative Force.
- This Negative Force also facilitates division, crudity as materialism, war, conflict, racism, etc.

To pursue selfishness, Economics teaches:
- arbitrage
- profit maximization
- finance and money-only exchange
- private sensory pleasures.

As a result, it only has:
- economic value (nominal price)
- market value (market price)

Economics | Personal | Society
--- | --- | ---
Subjective and Variable | **Nominal Price** (value in currency) | **Market Price** (value to the buyer)


We can now summarize and organize our 4 prices into a pattern:

Law | Price | Purpose
--- | --- | ---
1 | Nominal | Utilization - exposes the lack and the need
2 | Real | Specialization - drives action to increase quality and quantity to deal with the lack
3 | Natural | Balance - prevents the crashes that leads to a recurrence of lack
4 | Market | Diffusion - spreads quality and quantity to address the lack


We find that it exactky matches the Law of Social Cycles of Supersociology:

Cycle | Price
--- | --- 
Worker | Nominal 
Warrior | Real 
Thinker | Natural
Trader | Market  

From here, we can connect Supereconomics with Supersociology by making them the Four Laws of Value. 

Law | Price | Meaning
--- | --- | ---
1 | Nominal | Everything in the universe has value
2 | Real | Value is created to address lack
3 | Natural | There must be balance in the creation and spread of value
4 | Market | Value is spread through fair exchange

<!-- from the conversion of matter or ideas -->

Since we equate value to desire and desire in the physical domain is energy, then we can connect these 4 laws to the laws of thermodynamics:

Supereconomics Law | Physics Thermodynamics Law
--- | --- 
1 - Nominal | 3 - A system's entropy reaches a constant value as its temperature reaches absolute zero
2 - Real | 1 - Energy can be conerted from one form to another, but cannot be created nor destroyed
3 - Natural | 0 - If 2 systems are in thermal equilibrium with a 3rd system, then they are in equilibrium with each other
4 - Market | 2 - Entropy will always increase over time


{{< i s="/graphics/econ/laws.png" a="Laws of Value" >}}


- The 2nd and 1st law of thermodynamics refer to the external aspects of waves just as the Market and Real Price are objective 
- The 3rd and 0th laws refer to the internal aspects just as the Nominal and Market Price are subjective

<!-- We see that the organization of Physics laws are just as messy as those of Economics. This is because they were created without knowing the metaphysics of how things work.  -->


<!--  we can see how the four laws of value are the reverse of the laws of thermodynamics. For example:
- the First law or the Conservation of Energy is the 'first' in Physics, but is the third in Supereconomics, as trade
- the Third law, as absolute zero, is the last in Physics, but is the first in Supereconomics as its First law, as everything having a value. -->


<!-- For example, Physics believes that the universe began as an energetic Big Bang where energy began first, whereas humans start from birth or low-energy sleep where lack begins first. -->

<!-- Superphysics law | Thermodynamics law counterpart
--- | ---
1st | 3rd 
3rd | 2nd
4th | 1st
2nd | 0th -->


<!-- Zeroth Law =  thermal equilibrium.
If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. In simpler terms, it says that two objects at the same temperature will be in thermal equilibrium if placed in contact.

First Law = law of conservation of energy
Energy can only be transformed from one form to another. The total energy of a closed system remains constant.  This law forms the basis of various engineering applications such as power generation and refrigeration.

Second Law = entropy disunity in a system.
Any spontaneous process, the disorder of the isolated system increases. Closed systems get more disunited over time.

Third Law = disorder decreases as temp goes to absolute zero. absolute zero cannot be reached in practice. -->


<!-- We then input these laws according to our eagle equation in order to create our 'equation' for demand and supply as ps:pd{{< s v="D" >}}. This overturns the mercantilist 'Law' of Supply and Demand of Economics which treats of s and d as equals:

*Our eagle equation for all kinetic movementfits into both the Third Law of Thermodynamics and the Third Law of Value. The image above is for potental movement (I noticed that some physicists tend to be very fussy about the difference between potential and kinetic energy)*

We find that these four laws match the four factors of our [DCIT model](/posts-pantrynomics/the-demand-capital-industry-trade-model/) which is made up of:

| **Factor** | **Law of Value** | **Value** | **Model** | **Physics equivalent** | **Supereconomic system** | **Remarks** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Demand | First | Natural Price | GPFY | Higgs Field | Basic Universal Revenue <br> as store of value <br> and the Grain Index | Basis of economic justice <br> which is lacking in both <br> Capitalism and Communism |
| Capital | Second | Real Price | GUE | Gravitation (we gravitate <br> towards certain interests <br> based on our dharma) | Effort Theory of Value <br> ISAIAH Match | Leads to economic democracy <br> and maximized non-commercial potential|
| Industry | Third | Nominal Price <br> (value in currency) | GGAMS | Strong Layer | Real Price via <br> the Economic Table | Economic balance or stasis <br> that is lacking in Capitalism |
| Trade | Fourth | Market Price <br> (value to the buyer) | GRID | Electroweak | Exchange systems with maintenance cost | Regulates merchants as <br> the opposite of Mercantilism |

{{< dc t="Updates" >}}
4/2017 | added Economics value matrix
--- | ---
8/2020 | overhauled to match Superphysics
7/2021 | overhauled to base everything on the four laws
2/2022 | Added the four classes (Worker, Warrior, Philosopher, Merchant) onto the four laws
3/2024 | Put the 4th Law as the 2nd to explain the priorness of politics over economics, or Supersociology over Supereconomics
8/2024 | Put the 4th Law as the 3rd Law after connecting it again with Thermodynamics
