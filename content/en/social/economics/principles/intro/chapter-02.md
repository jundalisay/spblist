The society-organism itself is made up of individual waves | This leads to the division of labor in order to realize their every desire.

Essential to Supereconomics is the concept of the society-organism of Supersociology. 

It states that a society is a kind of metaphysical organism or mind that is made up of individual minds that agree to be part of that society either implicitly or explicitly.

> Society is a metaphysical organism that is made up of individual minds

This metaphysical organism is made up of waves that can be harmoniouus or discordant with each other. 
- A very harmonious wave leads to golden ages
- A very discordant wave leads to civil wars 

The best analogy is a musical composition where many instruments play together harmoniously. Each instrument has a specific role that makes the composition whole. 

## Division of Labor

In Economics, this leads to the concept of division of labor that is used to create supply and address demand.

The general division of labor is into 4 classes, matching the 4 laws of value:

1. Workers
2. Warriors 
3. Thinkers
4. Traders

These 4 classes alternate in strength, matching the dynamics of waves that rise and fall. 

<!-- Recall in the previous chapter that demand is really a wave that rises and falls. This wave-nature is due to the fact that the people and societies that emit those waves in abstract are also waves in themselves.  -->

Working together creates more force in society just as:
- 4 streams of water have more for more force when flowing in the same direction
- 4 instruments playing together creates more harmonious music

The goal of Supereconomics is to harmonize the supply with demand in real time globally so that the problems of lack can be made obsolete. This can be only made possible if the wave-nature of societies is understood.
