The Third Law of Value states: **There must be a balance in the creation and spread of value in an economy.** 

This mirrors the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics that has the concept of thermal equilibrium.

This concept does not exist in Economics because profit maximization prevents it. This is why modern economic systems have recurring crashes as a result of the violation of this natural law of value.

In contrast, supereconomic systems are crash-resistant because policymakers know that there exists a natural price and so the system is designed to stay near it.


### Natural Price: The Balance Between the 3 Classes

The Natural Price is the average price that the producer or seller can actually sell his goods or services with ordinary profits for a given period of time.
- Ordinary profits is the minimum level of profits that the seller will accept yet continue his trade indefinitely. This is subjective (comes as a range) and so it is different from break-even which is objective and exact. 

This is achieved when the 3 Laws are balanced and no law is made superior. 

- The First Law represents the demanders or consumers
- The Second Law represents the suppliers or producers
- The Fourth Law represents the middle men, finance, commerce

The Third Law comes before the Fourth Law because the merchants, middlemen, and finance are the most frequent causes of corruption of an economy. For example:
- the Roman Empire was notorious for the debasement of their coins
- the colonial governments gained great profits from selling native products without giving back to the colonies
- corporate owners gain by raising shareholder value without giving a corresponding increase in wages 
- the globalization of food transfers power from the farmer to the trader, which accordingly has caused food inflation globallyhas


{{< q a="Smith" c="Wealth of Nations, Book 1, Chapter 11" >}}
Merchants and master manufacturers employ the largest capitals.. Their thoughts and judgement commonly revolve around the interest of their own business, than around the interest of society.

The proposal of any new commercial law which comes from them should always be listened to with great precaution. It comes from an order of men whose interest is never exactly the same with the public interest.

This order generally has an interest to deceive and even oppress the public. They have done so on many occasions.
