### The Usufruct Circular Economy as Alternative to Linear Economy

The profit maximization doctrine has caused environmental destruction as it urges humans to make money without feeling for the consequences on the environment.

To reduce the damage to the environment, many academics, institutions, and government agencies have embraced the circular economy. This aims to share, lease, reuse, repair, refurbish and recycle existing materials and products as long as possible. 

We upgrade this into a *usufruct circular economy* from the Latin "usus et fructus" which means use and enjoyment of fruits. 

Usufruct is a legal right given to a person or party to temporarily use and derive benefit from someone else's property.

In this system, all real property will be leasedhold, whether agricultural, commercial, residential, or industrial. This will make the ownership of land dependent on certain conditions such as:
- taking care of it
- making it productive yet environmentally sustainable and
- using it in line with state policy. 

An analogy is the Earth as a ship. Each plot of land is cabin space or crew compartment.

The passengers are free to upgrade or change their cabins depending on their changing needs. This allows all cabin space to be utilized efficiently while giving each passenger the space that he or she needs to live properly.

This is most useful for right-of-way issues and ancestral domain wherein private or tribal ownership of land goes against the projects of the state that are meant for the majority benefit.  

The imposition of conditions means that this is a non-liberal system. Since its policies are voted on by congress or by the people, then it is still democratic, but non-liberal.

This is consistent with the regulated economy that Socrates was advocating in The Republic.


{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic, Book 4, Chapter 1" >}}
Wealth and Poverty are two causes of the deterioration of the arts. 

When a potter becomes rich he will grow more and more indolent and careless and become a worse potter.

But, on the other hand, if he has no money he cannot work well. Here, then, is a discovery of new evils of wealth and poverty, against which the guardians will have to watch, or they will creep unobserved.

The Usufruct Economy applies to goods and services as after sale support and responsibility. The manufacturers and service providers would pay into a state or NGO-run Usufruct System (US). 

- For consumer goods, the US will be tasked to collect the packaging and give them back to the manufacturer or its assigned recycler.
- For food, the US will be tasked with collecting food waste for redistribution or composting
- For services such as health insurance, the US could monitor the health of the policyholders and remind them of their risk factors through an app.

Here, the people, through the state or the NGO, show their concern for their Earth-ship through the Usufruct System. The different systems will then be ranked to see which is the most sustainable country or part of the Earth-ship.


### Points Banking 

The system can be run with very little money by using points and barter credits as a subsystem called **Points Banking**. This uses the points-based valuation mentioned in Chapter 1. 

For example, assume that in Town A, Arun has a vegetable garden and Bhaskar has a small bakery. Arun wants to buy 1 small cake worth $1. He has the following which he can offer:


Item | Nominal Money Price | Real Value per unit or kilo
--- | --- | ---
Dollars | $1 | 1 point
Tomatoes | $2 per kilo | 2 points 
String Beans | $1.5 per kilo | 1.5 points


Since the cake is 1 point, he can make the following offers to Bhaskar: $1, 0.5 kilos of Tomatoes, or 0.6 kilos of String Beans.

These all have the same real price of 1 point relative to both Arun and Bhaskar.

Of course, Bhaskar would readily choose the $1 since it is legal tender and can purchase other things that are for sale.

We can regard this flexibility of money as a premium* that adds to its real exchangeable value. 

{{< n n="We call this use-value" >}}


However, Bhaskar might choose to get tomatoes since that includes free delivery which can also be seen as a premium, especially if he thinks that free delivery is more useful than the flexibility of money. The determining factor is the effective demand of Bhaskar, which is totally subjective.

Assume that Bhaskar opts for 0.5 kilos of tomatoes as payment for 1 cake. At that point, the tomatoes become the market value while 1 point is the market price. 


### The Usufruct Economy Can Work Without Money

The main advantage of this system is that it allows the economy to keep on running even if there is no money, as what happens during financial crises and recessions.

Moreover, it eliminates the time value of money since the parties in the exchange do not charge each other interest for their unpaid cakes or tomatoes, which we call barter credits. 

If Arun only has 100 grams of tomatoes to pay for Bhaskarâ€™s cake, Bhaskar can accept it and wait for the 400 grams next time, as a barter-credit. This is opposed to giving only 20% of the cake for the 100 grams of tomatoes (which is direct barter, instead of barter-credit). The 400 grams of tomato-debt does not incur interest fees because the real value of a tomato is the same to the person who values tomatoes.
