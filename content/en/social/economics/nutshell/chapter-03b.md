The Gross National Happiness Centre in Bhutan replaces the materialistic GDP measure of Economics with measures of happiness. 

This is divided into 9 Domains which we can integrate into our minimum needs model:

1. Living Standards
2. Health and Education
3. Environment
4. Community
5. Vitality
6. Time Use
7. Mental Health
8. Culture
9. Good Governance

Good governance is at the top while living standards is at the bottom, matching the physiological needs from Abraham Maslow. 

This is because the policies of government can make or break the economy and along with it the happiness of society. This is easily seen in the difference between North and South Korea. 

Good governance, and most of the 9 domains, cannot be measured in material ouput, but in abstract feelings, as subjective opinion. These are measured through surveys. 

Supereconomics combines the objective and subjective by integrating economic data with a periodic survey. 

GDP is replaced by Net Domestic Product (NDP) which is GDP without the financial system since it does not contribute to real goods or services, but is just an enabler. NDP is included in “Living Standards”. 


### The Downward Sloping Demand Curve 

The previous chapter mentioned the Value of Rarity which says that rare items have higher nominal value than common ones. 

This can be plotted as the Downward Sloping Demand Curve that is used by both Economics and Supereconomics. As this is already well-known in Economics, we do not need to explain it here.
