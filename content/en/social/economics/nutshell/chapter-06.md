The Fourth Law of Value states: **Value is transferred through fair exchange whether it be through money, barter, points, promises, etc.** 

This law is derived from the Second Law of Thermodynamics which relates to heat transfer and entropy. This leads to the concept of Market Price which is the actual price nominal price that a thing is sold for in the market.


## Subjective Market Prices

Unlike Economics which only has 1 market price for a product or service, Supereconomics allows variable market prices for the same thing. This is the effect of Real Price Relativity or the relation between different kinds of people, since value is subjective.

In the real world, this is most commonly seen in Thailand where there is a higher “farang” price for foreigners and a lower natural price for locals. The mechanism there is the lack of fellow feeling with foreigners or those of a different mentality. 

In the beginning, an economy might have gross inequalities (such as employers not caring about their employees and vice versa) and so have very different market prices (here the price is in wages). 

But as it is converted into a supereconomic system, the inequalities and disparities get balanced out through time, and market prices can be of a single form. At that point, the economy is deemed unified.  


## Pool Clearing

This can be scaled globally by spreading the usufruct system overseas in a system called Pool Clearing, originally proposed by economist EF Schumacher as an alternative to Bretton Woods.

This creates a pool of countries that trade with each other using barter-credits, ending trade wars, and consequently real wars, forever. 

In Pool Clearing, nations trade with each other to help poor nations industrialize and to keep wealthy nations productive. This is the opposite of imbalanced globalization where China has overstrength in production, Vietnam in agriculture, and the Philippines in services.
