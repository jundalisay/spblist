The First Law of Value states: **Every thing in the universe has an existential value, otherwise it would not exist.**

This law is derived from the Third Law of Thermodynamics which says that absolute zero temperature is impossible to reach or maintain. In Supereconomics, this manifests as Nominal Price.


## Nominal Price: The Buyer’s Valuation

A purchaser assigns a nominal value to any good or service that he needs or wants, after his mind realizes that need or want.

This value can be denoted in 3 forms:

1. Money as number-objects - Examples are currency and crytocurrency

2. Moneyless Tangible - Examples are goods and services themselves

3. Moneyless Intangible - Examples are goodwill, reputation, mental satisfaction or peace of mind


Nominal price is exchangeable value denoted as a numerical object.

- In a money-system this number-object manifests as money
- In a moneyless system it manifests as points such as strings or shells or any system of notation. For example, strings were used by the Inca Empire to represent nominal value and account balances. It was used internally within their empire and money was only used for external trade as imports and exports, along with barter.

We implement this a points-based system where 1 point is based on the retail price of 1 kilogram of basic rice.

This means that everything in the economy is valuated in terms of rice. This is because everyone needs to eat and so everyone will be aware of the value of rice.


### The Doctrine of Minimum Needs

For example, we might need 600 grams of rice daily to live. This means that everyone should get 0.6 points revenue daily.

- If 1 kilo of rice costs $1, then everyone would need 60 cents per day
- If 1 kilo of rice costs $1.5, then 90 cents would be needed

The government would then need to arrange the economy so that everyone could get the value of 60-90 cents daily either by exchange or employment, or by donation or welfare.

We call this the **Doctrine of Minimum Needs** which replaces the doctrine of profit maximization. It says that a society should take care of its members just like family. 


{{< q a="Sismondi" c="New Principles of Political Economy" >}}
Political economists must always take 2 elements: the increase of happiness and its diffusion among all classes. This makes the political economy a theory of beneficence. Everything which does not concern happiness in the long run does not belong to this science. The human race originated in a single family.

{{< q a="Rousseau" c="Discourse on Political Economy" >}}
The word ‘Œconomy’ originally meant the wise government of a house of a family. This was was extended to the government of that great family, the State.. There is a close analogy between the State and the family.

Supereconomic systems with minimum needs creates a flatter distribution of wealth, while raising total wealth more than economic systems that follow profit maximization.

This is similar to a basketball team that has balanced players all working together to produce the most points. This is opposed to a team that focuses on a superstar player to make all the points. Injuries to, or mistakes by, that star player can impact the points-production very negatively, leading to lost games. In contrast, an injury in a balanced team can be compensated by the other players, leading to less risk of loss.
