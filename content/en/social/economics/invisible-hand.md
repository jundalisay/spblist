The invisible hand concept by Adam Smith is one of the most important ideas of Supereconomics, making up [the Third Law of Value](/social/economics/principles/part-2/chapter-01). 

This Third Law leads to [the effort theory of value](/social/economics/principles/part-2/chapter-01b) which then replaces marginal utility. Without marginal utility, the arbitrary marginal pricing and profit maximization of Neoclassical Economics cease to be logical as they necessarily violate the [Second Law of Value](/social/economics/principles/part-4/chapter-01/) which is the concept of **Natural Price**.


Unfortunately, such a fundamental concept has been thoroughly corrupted by Paul Samuelson in order to advance his selfish "neoclassical synthesis". Since then, it has been unjustly blamed for bad things about the economy and has even been denounced:

{{< youtube 9qjvwQrZmpk >}}


We bring back the original invisible hand by separating it from corrupted hand from Paul Samuelson:

{{< q a="Samuelson" c="Economics" >}}
Smith proclaimed the principle of the ‘invisible hand’. It says that every individual, in selfishly pursuing only his or her personal good, is led, as if by an invisible hand, to achieve the best good for all. In this best of all possible worlds, any interference with free competition is certain to be injurious.
{{< /q >}}

{{< q a="Samuelson" c="Economics" >}}
John D. Rockefeller’s dog may receive the milk that a poor child needs to avoid rickets. Why? Because supply and demand are working badly? No. Because **they are doing what they are designed to do**, putting goods in the hands of those who can pay the most.
{{< /q >}}


Of course, that is **ABSOLUTELY FALSE**, since Smith pointed to [sympathy and benevolence](/research/smith/theory-moral-sentiments/part-6/section-2/chapter-3/) (the direct opposite of selfishness), as the substance that keeps the machine called society running smoothly. 

Samuelson merely cherry-picked Smith’s views on self-interest, which to Smith was a 'praise-worthy' positive quality, and then corrupted it into selfishness which is a negative quality:


{{< q a="Adam-Smith" c="Theory Of Moral Sentiments Simplified, Part 7, Section 2, Chapter 3" >}}
Regard to our own private happiness and interest often appear as very laudable principles of action. The habits of oeconomy, industry, discretion, attention, and application of thought, are cultivated from self-interested motives. These habits are seen as very praise-worthy qualities.. 

Our instinct for self-preservation instructs us to take proper care of our health, life, or fortune. A person who fails in this would be pitied. Carelessness and want of economy are universally disapproved of because it shows a lack of attention to the objects of self-interest and not because of the lack of benevolence.
{{< /q >}}


{{< img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*S2Nqp0-o_oPdcW_vRwxvIg.jpeg" alt="Cartoon showing carelessness" cap="Being careful does not mean being selfish" >}}


Human creatures should be more careful and attentive (have attention to the self). This does not mean that they should be selfish.


> Humans should be more careful and attentive, not selfish.


The cause of the corruption of "self-interest" into "selfishness" is the word "self" that is present in both ideas*. 

{{< dc t="Update: Dec 2020 (click to expand" >}}
*A recent example is the wrong use of the word 'social distancing' to mean a physical separation to avoid virus transmission. This is because 'society' represents an abstract perception. Social distancing would therefore mean being a loner or not minding others even if one is in a jampacked bus or train. 

The proper term is 'physical distancing'. 

Mistakes like these can be avoided if Metaphysics or Dialectics were put back as a field of study instead of the rubbish nonsense called Epistemology (which, by following Smith's logic, merely replaced the earlier rubbish nonsense called Ontology. Socrates would call modern epistemologists as pseudo-philosophers who just argue for the sake of arguing).

To solve this, we will instead use 'personal interest', using the Latin word 'person', meaning mask, instead of the English 'self' which means 'I'. In this way:
- Samuelson's invisible hand leads to selfishness
- Smith's implies personal preferences or choice 

<!-- Metaphysically, a mask refers to an indirect ego, different from 'I' which is the direct ego. 

To prove this, we cross-reference it with Japanese or Chinese language wherein:
- `私` or `我` has one character
- `自分` or `个人` has 2 characters. 

A word that has fewer characters is a more fundamental or direct expression than one with more characters, just as 'Sun' is more fundamental than 'Sunday'. -->


If a man orders burgers instead of fries, we never say that he is selfish for burgers. We would only say that he is selfish for burgers if his entire self revolves around burgers as to eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner 365 days in a year.


## The Original Invisible Hand: By Design

Now that we have flushed Samuelson's invisible hand down the toilet, we can move to the one described by Smith. 

![Beautiful hand](/photos/objects/hand.jpg)

Its best description is in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, wherein he describes the **innate human desire for things to work as they were meant to**:

{{< q a="Adam-Smith" c="Theory Of Moral Sentiments Simplified, Part 4" >}}
A watch that falls behind more than 2 minutes in a day, is despised by one curious in watches. He sells it for 2 guineas and purchases another at 50 guineas which will not lose more than 1 minute in a fortnight.. What interests him is not the knowing the time, but the perfection of the machine to attain it.
{{< /q >}}


Humans have an innate desire for things to work as they were designed. This natural desire applies even to human systems such as resource allocation:

{{< q a="Adam-Smith" c="Theory Of Moral Sentiments Simplified, Part 4 [emphases Added]" >}}
The proud and unfeeling landlord views his fields, and without a thought for his brethren, imagines to eat its whole harvest.. The capacity of his stomach is far less than the immensity of his desires and receives no more than that of the peasant. 

<b>The rest of the food he is obliged to distribute among his servants</b>.. The rich.. divide with the poor the produce of all their improvements despite their selfishness. 
{{< /q >}}

{{< q a="Adam-Smith" c="Simple Theory Of Moral Sentiments, Part 4 [emphases Added]" >}}
They are **led by an invisible hand to make nearly the same distribution of life’s necessities** which would have been made, had the earth been divided equally. Thus, without intending it, they advance the interest of the society..

When Providence divided the earth.. it [did not forget]  those who were left out. In the <b>real happiness of human life</b>, [the poor] are not inferior to those who seem above them. In ease of body and <b>peace of mind</b>, all are nearly on a level. The beggar, who suns himself by the side of the highway, possesses that security which kings are fighting for.
{{< /q >}}


{{< img src="https://socioecons.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/a57b1eeaaa64397c14baad182f7bf96d-beautiful-pictures-beautiful-people.jpg" alt="Buddhist monk laughing" cap="Buddhist monks also beg and sun themselves on the highway yet have the happiness and security that kings are fighting for. Australian moralist Peter Singer thinks that the beggar mentioned by Smith is the dirty type. This is because Australia has no culture of Buddhist or Hindu monks begging. This makes him think that Smith was promoting poverty and inequality. " >}}


## A Natural Economy Based on Skill Instead of Welfare

<!-- This perfection of the distribution of resources is thus done by **employment**. When a school's basketball team looks for players, it doesn't base its hiring on the players' friendliness, but on their skill. This is true for entrepreneurs hiring workers or outsouring jobs and production to other countries. This focus on skill is more fundamental than the focus on compassion or community: -->

This perfection of the distribution of resources is thus done by employing specific people, just as the parts of a watch work together to tell the time accurately. 

More resources are given to productive people just as a better watch costs more. And so the natural system encourages productivity.

But to be productive, one must focus his entire time and effort towards his craft. But to spend so much time in something, a person must first **be passionate about it**. 

Therefore passion in one's craft is the key in the natural economic system. This is our [third law of value](/social/economics/principles/part-2/chapter-01)

> To spend so much time in something, a person must first be passionate about it

Liberals and selfish people corrupt this personal passion to mean selfish-interest. That is why we had to totally flush out the "selfish-interest hand" of Samuelson to bring back the "personal passion hand" of Smith. This is in line with the economic system of Socrates:

{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic Simplified, Book 2, Chapter 2" >}}
We are not all alike. There are diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different occupations. A person works better when he has only one occupation instead of many.. If so, all things are produced more plentifully and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is natural to him.  
{{< /q >}}



## Fair Exchange

With everyone finding their passion in life, a nation's products and services becomes of higher quality and quantity. This is then exchanged for those of other countries. This makes up our [Fourth Law of value](/social/economics/principles/part-3/chapter-01)

{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic Simplified, Book 2, Chapter 2" >}}
They will need a marketplace to exchange their productions. If a husbandman or an artisan brings some product to market, and no one is available to exchange with him, he will not sit idle. He will find people there who, seeing the want, be salesmen.
{{< /q >}}


Therefore, a natural economy, following the invisible hand:
- raises and encourages skill
- supports personal passions
- produces a lot of high quality products and services
- distributes those products and services through fair exchange


{{< q a="Smith" c="Wealth of Nations, Book 4, Chapter 2" >}}
Every individual necessarily works to render the society's annual revenue as great as he can. He generally does not:
- intend to promote the public interest, or
- know how much he is promoting it

<!-- By preferring to support domestic industry over foreign industry, he intends only his own security. -->
By directing that industry to produce the greatest value, he intends only his own gain. In this case, as in many other cases, he is led by an **invisible hand** to promote an end which he did not intend.
<!-- - "Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it." -->
{{< /q >}}


### No to External Micromanagement, Nor Internal Selfishness

Since we replaced selfish-interest with personal passion, we can safely edit the phrase below:

{{< q a="Smith" c="Wealth of Nations, Book 4, Chapter 2" >}}
**By pursuing his** ~~own interest~~ **personal passion**, he frequently promotes the society's interest more effectively than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation not very common among merchants. Very few words can be used to dissuade them from it.
{{< /q >}}

It is very important to note that personal interests should always be in line with the common interest: 

{{< q a="Adam-Smith" c="Theory of Moral Sentiments Simplified, Part 6, Chapter 2" >}}
Every individual is continually exerting himself to find out the most advantageous employment for whatever capital he can command. It is his own advantage which he has in view [svadharma or personal interest], and not that of the society. But the study of his own advantage **naturally leads him to prefer that employment which is most advantageous to society** [human dharma or common interest].

That wisdom which contrived the system of human affections and that of every other part of nature, seems to have judged that the interest of the great society of mankind [human dharma or common interest] would be best promoted by directing the principal attention of each individual to what was most within the sphere of his abilities and understanding [svadharma or personal interest].
{{< /q >}}

{{< q a="Adam-Smith" c="Wealth of Nations, Book 4, Chapter 2" >}}
Every individual can, in his local situation [svadharma or personal interest], judge much better than any statesman on what domestic industry his capital produce the greatest value. The statesman who directs private people how they should employ their capitals would load himself with a most unnecessary attention.
{{< /q >}}

> Personal interests should be in line with the common interest


{{< i s="/photos/econ/singer.jpg" a="Singer" c="People passionate in singing should pursue singing and earn better revenue from inferior singers" >}}


People passionate in singing should pursue singing just as people passionate about money-trading should pursue money-trading. However, it does not mean that society should be ruled by songs or by money. 

The natural economic system creates wealth but also should guard against it through the visible hand of institutions:

<!-- But it is very common for one class of people to dominate the economy and create an imbalance:  -->


{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic Simplified, Book 4, Chapter 1" >}}
Wealth and Poverty are two causes of the deterioration of the arts. When a potter becomes rich he will:
- not think of you as much as before,
- grow more and more indolent and careless, becoming a worse potter.

But, on the other hand, if he has no money, he cannot provide himself with tools or instruments nor teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well.

So under either poverty or wealth, workers can degenerate. Here, then, is a discovery of new evils of wealth and poverty, against which the guardians will have to watch, or they will creep into the city unobserved.
{{< /q >}}


{{< q a="Adam-Smith" c="Theory Of Moral Sentiments, Part 4, Chapter 1" >}}
When a person finds the chairs [disordered in his bedroom], he takes the trouble to set them all in their proper places. This arises from the superior convenience of having the floor clear. To attain this convenience, he voluntarily puts himself to more trouble than all he could have suffered from its inconvenience. 

Therefore, he wanted more of the arrangement of things which promotes the convenience, than the convenience itself.. 

Those institutions which promote the public welfare have the same principle, the same love of system, and the same regard to the beauty of order and art.
{{< /q >}}


Human institutions should stamp out the dangers of both poverty and wealth, such as inequality, environmental destruction, 

If the invisible hand is a natural phenomena, then other societies should have noticed it as to describe it. Fortunately, Ancient India and Greece have such words:
- In Greek, the invisible hand is called δίκαιος 
- In Sanskrit, it is called dharma

Both the Indians and Greeks define dharma as being a part or aspect of the Supreme Entity, exactly as Adam Smith described the invisible hand.  

{{< q a="Adam-Smith" c="Origin Of Philosophy Simplified" >}}
In all Polytheistic religions.. only the irregular events of nature are ascribed to.. their gods. By.. their own nature: fire burns, water refreshes, heavy bodies descend, lighter substances fly upwards. 

The invisible hand of Jupiter was never perceived in those matters. But the more irregular events were ascribed to Jupiter’s favour or anger: storms and sunshine, thunder and lightning.  Savages only knew the designing power of man.
