Joan Robinson created the term ‘monopsony’ in 1932 because she thought that the term ‘monopoly buyer’ was illogical since mono + poly =. single + seller so therefore monopoly buyer = single -seller buyer. 

But she failed to understand that monopoly in the original 16th century sense was tied to the concept of ‘trade’ which in turn meant both buying and selling, because trade was done in barter back then. So a British merchant who had monopoly on America would ‘sell’ British trinkets and in exchange for (or ’buy’) American timber exclusively.

When money became common then buying part was just implied. That is, when I buy bread for $1, the baker is buying my $1 and I am buying his bread. Therefore monopoly really means exclusive buying and selling. To isolate the selling action, monopoly seller is used. To isolate the buying action, monopoly buyer is used. 

She didn’t know this, so she invented a useless concept called monopsony.
