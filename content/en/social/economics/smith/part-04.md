## Flaw 2: Economics is created from the point of view of the exact physical sciences instead of the inexact social sciences, and for those who live by profit

The absurd principles of the marginal revolution were later set in stone through Marshall’s Principles of Economics (1890) and was further expanded by Knut Wicksell (Interest and Prices, 1898) and Irving Fisher (The Purchasing Power of Money, 1911). In an effort to formalize such absurd principles as an exact science, Marshall, following the footsteps of Jevons, made a critical mistake of calling them “economic laws”, imposing the Monetary dogma and purging the invisible hand from the new science of economics:


{{< q a="Marshall" c="Principles of Economics, Book 1, Chap. 3, emphasis added" >}}
Those physical sciences..are not all of them strictly speaking “exact sciences.” But they all aim at exactness… A science progresses by increasing the number and exactness of its laws; by submitting them to tests of ever increasing severity; and by enlarging their scope till a single broad law contains and supersedes a number of narrower laws, which have been shown to be special instances of it…The laws of economics are to be compared with the laws of the tides, rather than with the simple and exact law of gravitation. 
{{< /q >}}


{{< q a="Marshall" c="" >}}
For the actions of men are so various and uncertain, that the best statement of tendencies, which we can make in a science of human conduct, must needs be inexact and faulty…The term “law” means then nothing more than a general proposition or statement of tendencies, more or less certain, more or less definite…Economic laws, or statements of economic tendencies, are those social laws which relate to branches of conduct in which the strength of the motives chiefly concerned can be measured by a money price.
{{< /q >}}


Economics and business students, unfortunately, have since equated such inexact “statement of tendencies” with exact scientific laws or dogmas which cannot be changed. These mathematical “get-rich-quick” principles gave new power to big US banks and corporations in the 1920’s and allowed the profusion of nominal value vehicles—money, stocks, investments trusts (Taibbi, 2009)—until the US economy crashed back to its real value in 1929, marking the start of the Great Depression.

W. S. Jevons and Alfred Marshall, intellectuals who favored the exact sciences, have unfortunately turned economics into more of a physical science instead of rightfully keeping it as an inexact social science as what Adam Smith had done. 

Never did Smith, nor any ancient Eastern philosopher, have the audacity to draft their own economic laws or even create mathematical formulations for human behavior as, perhaps, they knew that the human mind cannot be constrained by concepts made by itself. 


Unlike other economists, Smith did not put a price on people:

{{< q a="Smith" c="Book 1, Chap. 8, Par. 15" >}}
A man must always live by his work, and his wages must at least be sufficient to maintain him... 

Mr. Cantillon seems, upon this account, to suppose that the lowest species of common labourers must every where earn at least double their own maintenance, in order that one with another they may be enabled to bring up two children; the labour of the wife, on account of her necessary attendance on the children, being supposed no more than sufficient to provide for herself...
{{< /q >}}

{{< q a="Smith" c="Book 1, Chap. 8, Par. 15" >}}
Cantillon adds that the labour of an able-bodied slave is computed to be worth double his maintenance; and that of the meanest labourer, he thinks, cannot be worth less than that of an able-bodied slave. 

Thus far at least seems certain, that, in order to bring up a family, the labour of the husband and wife together must, even in the lowest species of common labour, be able to earn something more than what is precisely necessary for their own maintenance; but in what proportion, whether in that above mentioned, or in any other, I shall not take upon me to determine..

The economist-authors of the marginal revolution of the 1800’s inherited the Monetary Dogma from the Mercantile system and clothed it in new Capitalist trappings, permanently infusing it with the corporation and mercantile spirit. Instead of gold and silver, the nominal values in the form of paper money and paper stocks became the new obsession and, like Mercantilism, created a new economic system that benefited only the rich:


{{< q a="Smith" c="Book 4, Chapter 8, Par. 4" >}}
It is the industry which is carried on for the benefit of the rich and the powerful that is principally encouraged by our mercantile system. That which is carried on for the benefit of the poor and the indigent is too often either neglected or oppressed.
{{< /q >}}


{{< q a="Smith" c="Book 1, Chapter 10, Par. 77" >}}
The inhabitants of a town, being collected into one place, can easily combine together. The most insignificant trades carried on in towns have accordingly..been incorporated; and even where they have never been incorporated, yet the corporation spirit, the jealousy of strangers, the aversion to take apprentices, or to communicate the secret of their trade, generally prevail in them, and often teach them, by voluntary associations and agreements, to prevent that free competition which they cannot prohibit by bye-laws.

As economic activity works best in civilized societies for the greater goal of attaining true happiness, the invisible hand of human dharma will work best if all sectors of all societies have a say in economic policy without the exclusive spirit of corporation nor the  imposition of restrictive economic laws and arbitrary valuations.
