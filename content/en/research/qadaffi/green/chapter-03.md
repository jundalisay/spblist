The party is a contemporary form of dictatorship. It is the modern instrument of dictatorial government. The party is the rule of a part over the whole. As a party is not an individual, it creates a superficial democracy by establishing assemblies, committees, and propaganda through its members. 

The party is not a democratic instrument because it is composed only of those people
who have common interests, a common perception or a shared
culture; or those who belong to the same region or share the
same belief. They form a party to achieve their ends, impose
their will, or extend the dominion of their beliefs, values, and
interests to the society as a whole. A party’s aim is to achieve
power under the pretext of carrying out its program. Democratically, none of these parties should govern a whole people who
constitute a diversity of interests, ideas, temperaments, regions
and beliefs. The party is a dictatorial instrument of government
that enables those with common outlooks or interests to rule the
people as a whole. Within the community, the party represents
a minority.

The purpose of forming a party is to create an instrument to
rule the people, i.e., to rule over non-members of the party. The
party is, fundamentally, based on an arbitrary authoritarian concept – the domination of the members of the party over the restof the people. The party presupposes that its accession to power is the way to attain its ends, and assumes that its objectives are also those of the people. This is the theory justifying party dictatorship, and is the basis of any dictatorship. 

No matter how many parties exist, the theory remains valid.
The existence of many parties intensifies the struggle for power, and this results in the neglect of any achievements for the
people and of any socially beneficial plans. Such actions are presented as a justification to undermine the position of the ruling party so that an opposing party can replace it. The parties very
seldom resort to arms in their struggle but, rather, denounce and
denigrate the actions of each other. This is a battle which is inevitably waged at the expense of the higher, vital interests of the
society. 

Some, if not all, of those higher interests will fall prey
to the struggle for power between instruments of government,
for the destruction of those interests supports the opposition in
their argument against the ruling party or parties. In order to
rule, the opposition party has to defeat the existing instrument
of government.

To do so, the opposition must minimize the government’s
achievements and cast doubt on its plans, even though those
plans may be beneficial to the society. Consequently, the interests and programs of the society become the victims of the parties’ struggle for power. Such struggle is, therefore, politically,
socially, and economically destructive to the society, despite the
fact that it creates political activity.

Thus, the struggle results in the victory of another instrument
of government; the fall of one party, and the rise of another. It
is, in fact, a defeat for the people, i.e., a defeat for democracy.
Furthermore, parties can be bribed and corrupted either from
inside or outside.



Originally, the party is formed ostensibly to represent the
people. Subsequently, the party leadership becomes representative of the membership, and the leader represents the party elite.

It becomes clear that this partisan game is a deceitful farce based
on a false form of democracy. It has a selfish authoritarian character based on maneuvres, intrigues and political games. 

This confirms the fact that the party system is a modern instrument
of dictatorship. The party system is an outright, unconvincing
dictatorship, one which the world has not yet surpassed. It is, in
fact, the dictatorship of the modern age.
The parliament of the winning party is indeed a parliament
of the party, for the executive power formed by this parliament
is the power of the party over the people. Party power, which
is supposedly for the good of the whole people, is actually the
arch-enemy of a fraction of the people, namely, the opposition
party or parties and their supporters. The opposition is, therefore, not a popular check on the ruling party but, rather, is itself
opportunistically seeking to replace the ruling party. According
to modern democracy, the legitimate check on the ruling party
is the parliament, the majority of whose members are from that
ruling party. That is to say, control is in the hands of the ruling party, and power is in the hands of the controlling party.

Thus the deception, falseness and invalidity of the political theories dominant in the world today become obvious. From these
emerge contemporary conventional democracy.

“The party represents a segment of the people, but the
sovereignty of the people is indivisible.”
“The party allegedly governs on behalf of the people, but in
reality the true principle of democracy is based upon the notion
that there can be no representation in lieu of the people.”



The party system is the modern equivalent of the tribal or sectarian system. A society governed by one party is similar to one which is governed by one tribe or one sect. The party, as shown,
represents the perception of a certain group of people, or the
interests of one group in society, or one belief, or one region.
Such a party is a minority compared with the whole people, just
as the tribe and the sect are. The minority has narrow, common
sectarian interests and beliefs, from which a common outlook is
formed. Only the blood-relationship distinguishes a tribe from a
party, and, indeed, a tribe might also be the basis for the foundation of a party. There is no difference between party struggle and
tribal or sectarian struggles for power. Just as tribal and sectarian rule is politically unacceptable and inappropriate, likewise
the rule under a party system. Both follow the same path and
lead to the same end.The negative and destructive effects of the
tribal or sectarian struggle on society is identical to the negative
and destructive effects of the party struggle.
