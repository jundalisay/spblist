To the individual, the family is more important than the state.
Mankind acknowledges the individual as a human being, and
the individual acknowledges the family, which is his cradle, his
origin, and his social umbrella. According to the law of nature,
the human race is the individual and the family, but not the
state. The human race has neither relations nor anything else
to do with the state, which is an artificial political, economic,
and sometimes military, system. The family is like a plant, with
branches, stems, leaves and blossoms. Cultivating nature into
farms and gardens is an artificial process that has no relevance
to the plant itself. The fact that certain political, economic or
military factors tie a number of families into one state does not
necessarily link this system or its organization with humanity.
Similarly, any situation, position or proceeding that results in the
dispersion, decline or loss of the family is inhuman, unnatural
and oppressive, analogous to any procedure, measure or action
that destroys a plant and its branches and withers its leaves and
blossoms.

Societies in which the existence and unity of the family become threatened due to any circumstance, are similar to fields
whose plants experience uprooting, drought, fire, weathering or
death. The blossoming garden or field is one whose plants grow,
blossom and pollinate naturally. The same holds true of human societies. The flourishing society is that in which the individual grows naturally within the family and the family within society.
The individual is linked to the larger family of humankind like
a leaf is to a branch or a branch to a tree. They have no value or
life if they are separated. The same holds true for individuals if
they are separated from their families â€“ the individual without
a family has no value or social life. If human society reaches the
stage where the individual lives without a family, it would then
become a society of tramps, without roots, like artificial plants.
