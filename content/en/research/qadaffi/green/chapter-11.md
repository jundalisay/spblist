Part 2: The Solution of the Economic Problem: Socialism


Important historical developments contributing to the solution of the problem of work and wages – the relationship between producers and owners, workers and employers – have occurred in recent history. These developments include the determination of fixed working hours, overtime pay, leaves, minimal wages, profit sharing, the participation of workers in administration, the banning of arbitrary dismissal, social security, the right to strike, and other provisions contained in labour codes of almost all contemporary legislation. Of no less significance are changes in the realm of ownership, such as the enactment of laws transferring private ownership to the state, and also those limiting income. Despite these not inconsiderable developments in the history of economics, the problem still fundamentally exists, even though it has been made less severe than in past centuries through improvements, refinements and developments that have brought many benefits to the workers.

However, the economic problem still persists unsolved in the
world. Attempts aimed at ownership have failed to solve the
problems of producers. They are still wage-earners, despite the
state ownership which may vary from the extreme right to the
extreme left to the centre of the political spectrum.
Attempts to improve wages were equally significant to those
that were aimed at the transferral of ownership. In the wake of
the Industrial Revolution, benefits from wage negotiations secured for workers certain privileges that were guaranteed by
legislation and protected by trade unions, thus improving the
lot of the workers. As time passed, workers, technicians, and
administrators have acquired certain rights which were previously unattainable. However, in reality, the economic problem
still exists.

Attempts that were aimed at wages were contrived and reformative, and have failed to provide a solution. They were more
of a charity than a recognition of the rights of the workers. Why
do workers receive wages? Because they carry out a production
process for the benefit of others who hire them to produce a
certain product. In this case, they do not consume what they
produce; rather, they are compelled to concede their product
for wages. Hence, the sound rule: those who produce consume.
Wage-earners, however improved their wages may be, are a type
of slave.

Wage-earners are but slaves to the masters who hire them.

They are temporary slaves, and their slavery lasts as long as
they work for wages from employers, be they individuals or the
state. The workers’ relationship to the owner or the productive
establishment, and to their own interests, is similar under all
prevailing conditions in the world today, regardless of whether
ownership is right or left. Even publicly-owned establishments
give workers wages as well as other social benefits, similar to the
charity endowed by the rich owners of economic establishments
upon those who work for them.

Unlike the privately-owned establishment where income benefits the owner, the claim that the income from the public-owned
establishment benefits all of the society, including the workers, is
true only if we take into consideration the general welfare of the society and not the private well-being of the workers. Further, we would have to assume that the political authority controlling ownership is that of all the people, practised through the Popular Conferences and People’s Committees, and not the authority of one class, one party, several parties, one sect, tribe, family, individual, or any form of representative authority. Failing this, what is received directly by the workers with respect to their own interests, in the form of wages, percentage of profits
or social benefits, is the same as that received by workers in a
private corporation. In both instances, the producers are wageearners, despite the difference in ownership. Thus, this change in ownership has not solved the problem of the producer’s right
to benefit directly from what he produces, and not through the
society nor through wages. The proof thereof is the fact that producers are still wage-earners despite the change in this state of ownership.

The ultimate solution lies in abolishing the wage-system,
emancipating people from its bondage and reverting to the natural laws which defined relationships before the emergence of
classes, forms of governments and man-made laws. These natural rules are the only measures that ought to govern human
relations.

These natural rules have produced natural socialism based on
equality among the components of economic production, and
have maintained public consumption almost equal to natural
production among individuals. The exploitation of man by man
and the possession by some individuals of more of the general
wealth than their needs required is a manifest departure from
the natural rule and the beginning of distortion and corruption in the life of the human community. It heralds the start of the exploitative society.

If we analyse the factors of economic production from ancient
times to the present, we always find that they essentially consist of certain basic production components, i.e., raw materials, means of production, and a producer. The natural rule of equality requires that each of these components receives a share of
this production. Because production cannot be achieved without the essential role of each of these components, it has to
be equally divided amongst them. 

The preponderance of one
of them contravenes the natural rule of equality and becomes
an encroachment upon the others’ rights. Thus, each must be
awarded an equal share, regardless of the number of components in the process of production. If the components are two,
each receives half of the production; if three, then one-third.
Applying this natural rule to both ancient and modern situations, we arrive at the following. At the stage of manual production, the process of production resulted from raw material
and a producer. Later, new means of production were added
to the process. Animals, utilized as power units, constitute a
good example. Gradually, machines replaced animals, types and
amounts of raw materials evolved from the simple and inexpensive to the valuable and complex. Likewise, the unskilled workers became skilled workers and engineers; their former huge
numbers dwindling to a few specialized technicians.

Despite the fact that components have qualitatively and quantitatively changed, their essential role in production has remained basically unaltered. For example, iron ore, a component
of both past and present production, was manufactured primitively by iron smiths into knives, axes, spears, etc. The same 
iron ore is now manufactured by engineers and technicians by
means of smelting furnaces into all kinds of machines, engines
and vehicles. The animal - horse, mule, camel, or the like – which
was a component of production, has been replaced by factories
and huge machines. Production, based upon primitive tools, is
now founded upon sophisticated technical instruments. Despite
these tremendous changes, the components of natural production remain basically the same. This consistency inevitably necessitates returning to sound natural rules to solve the economic
problems that are the result of all previous historical attempts to
formulate solutions that ignore these rules.

All previous historical theories tackled the economic problem
either from the angle of ownership of any of the components of
production, or from that of wages for production. They failed to
solve the real problem; the problem of production itself. Thus,
the most important characteristic of economic order prevailing
in the world today is a wage system that deprives the workers
of any right to the products being produced, be it for the society
or for a private establishment.

An industrial establishment is composed of material for production, machines and workers. Production is achieved by workers manufacturing materials and using machines. Thus, manufactured goods would not have been ready for use and consumption had they not gone through a production process requiring raw materials, factories, and workers. Clearly, without
basic raw materials, the factory cannot operate and without the
factory, raw materials will not be manufactured. Likewise, without producers, the factory comes to a halt. Thus, the three factors
are equally essential to the process of production, and without
them there can be no production. The absence of any one of these components cannot be replaced by the others. Therefore,
the natural rule necessitates each component receiving an equal
share of the benefits of production. It is not only the factory that
is important, but those who consume its production as well.
The same is applicable to agricultural production processes
resulting from only two components: man and land. The product must be divided equally into two shares congruent with the
number of production components. Furthermore, if any additional mode, mechanical or otherwise is utilized in the process,
production must be equally divided into three shares: the land,
the farmer, and the means of production. Consequently, a socialist system emerges under which all production processes are
governed by this natural rule.

The producers are the workers; they are called producers because the terms “worker,” “labourer,” and “toiler” have become
invalid. The traditional definition is revised because workers are
undergoing qualitative and quantitative changes. The working
class is declining proportionately to the advancement of science
and technology.

Tasks once performed by a number of workers are now being
carried out by a single machine. Operating a machine requires
fewer workers; this has brought about a quantitative change in
the labour force, while the replacement of physical force by technical skill has resulted in a qualitative change in the labour force.

The labour force has become a component of the production process. As a result of technical advancement, multitudes
of unskilled toilers have been transformed into limited numbers of technicians, engineers and scientists. Consequently, trade unions will subsequently disappear and be replaced by syndicates of engineers and technicians. Scientific advancement is an irreversible gain for humankind. Thanks to this process, illiteracy will be eliminated and unskilled workers will become a temporary phenomenon destined to gradual disappearance. However, even in this new environment, persons will always remain the basic component in the production process.
