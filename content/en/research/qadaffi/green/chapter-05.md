Plebiscites are a fraud against democracy. Those who vote “yes” or “no” do not, in fact, express their free will but, rather, are silenced by the modern conception of democracy as they are not allowed to say more than “yes” or “no”. Such a system is oppressive and tyrannical. Those who vote “no” should express their reasons and why they did not say “yes”, and those who say “yes” should verify such agreement and why they did not vote “no”. Both should state their wishes and be able to justify their “yes” or “no” vote. What then, is the path to be taken by humanity in order to conclusively rid itself of the elements of dictatorship and tyranny?

The intricate problem in the case of democracy is reflected in
the nature of the instrument of government, which is demonstrated by conflicts of classes, parties and individuals. The elections and plebiscites were invented to cover the failure of these
unsuccessful experiments to solve this problem. The solution lies
in finding an instrument of government other than those which
are subject to conflict and which represent only one faction of
society; that is to say, an instrument of government which is not
a party class, sect or a tribe, but an instrument of government
which is the people as a whole. In other words, we seek an instrument of government which neither represents the people nor
speaks in their name.

There can be no representation in lieu of the people and representation is fraud. If such an instrument can be found, then
the problem is solved and true popular democracy is realized.
Thus, humankind would have terminated the eras of tyranny
and dictatorships, and replaced them with the authority of the
people.

THE GREEN BOOK presents the ultimate solution to the
problem of the instrument of government, and indicates for the
masses the path upon which they can advance from the age of
dictatorship to that of genuine democracy.

This new theory is based on the authority of the people, without representation or deputation. It achieves direct democracy in
an orderly and effective form. It is superior to the older attempts
at direct democracy which were impractical because they lacked
popular organizations at base levels.

Popular Conferences And People’s Committees

Popular Conferences are the only means to achieve popular
democracy. Any system of government contrary to this method,
the method of Popular Conferences, is undemocratic. All the
prevailing systems of government in the world today will remain undemocratic, unless they adopt this method. Popular
Conferences are the end of the journey of the masses in quest
of democracy.

Popular Conferences and People’s Committees are the
fruition of the people’s struggle for democracy. Popular Conferences and People’s Committees are not creations of the imagination; they are the product of thought which has absorbed all
human experiments to achieve democracy.

Direct democracy, if put into practice, is indisputably the ideal
method of government. Because it is impossible to gather all
people, however small the population, in one place so that they
can discuss, discern and decide policies, nations departed from
direct democracy, which became an utopian idea detached from
reality. It was replaced by various theories of government, such
as representative councils, party-coalitions and plebiscites, all of
which isolated the masses and prevented them from managing
their political affairs.

These instruments of government – the individual, the class,
the sect, the tribe, the parliament and the party struggling to achieve power have plundered the sovereignty of the masses and
monopolized politics and authority for themselves.
THE GREEN BOOK guides the masses to an unprecedented
practical system of direct democracy. No two intelligent people
can dispute the fact that direct democracy is the ideal, but until
now no practical method for its implementation has been devised. The Third Universal Theory, however, now provides us
with a practical approach to direct democracy. The problem of
democracy in the world will finally be solved. All that is left before the masses now is the struggle to eliminate all prevailing forms of dictatorial governments, be they parliament, sect,
tribe, class, one-party system, two-party system or multi-party
system, which falsely call themselves democracies.

True democracy has but one method and one theory. The dissimilarity and diversity of the systems claiming to be democratic
do, in fact, provide evidence that they are not so. Authority of
the people has but one face which can only be realized through
Popular Conferences and People’s Committees. There can be no
democracy without Popular Conferences and Committees everywhere.

First, the people are divided into Basic Popular Conferences.
Each Basic Popular Conference chooses its secretariat. The secretariats of all Popular Conferences together form Non-Basic Popular Conferences. Subsequently, the masses of the Basic Popular Conferences select administrative People’s Committees to replace government administration. All public institutions are run
by People’s Committees which will be accountable to the Basic Popular Conferences which dictate the policy and supervise
its execution. Thus, both the administration and the supervision
become the people’s and the outdated definition of democracy
– democracy is the supervision of the government by the people
– becomes obsolete. It will be replaced by the true definition:
Democracy is the supervision of the people by the people.
All citizens who are members of these Popular Conferences
belong, vocationally and functionally, to various sectors and
have, therefore, to form themselves into their own professional
Popular Conferences in addition to being, by virtue of citizenship, members of the Basic Popular Conferences or People’s
Committees. Subjects dealt with by the Popular Conferences and People’s Committees will eventually take their final shape in the
General People’s Congress, which brings together the Secretariats of the Popular Conferences and People’s Committees. Resolutions of the General People’s Congress, which meets annually
or periodically, are passed on to the Popular Conferences and
People’s Committees, which undertake the execution of those
resolutions through the responsible committees, which are, in
turn, accountable to the Basic Popular Conferences.
The General People’s Congress is not a gathering of persons
or members such as those of parliaments but, rather, a gathering
of the Popular Conferences and People’s Committees.
Thus, the problem of the instrument of government is naturally solved, and all dictatorial instruments disappear. The people become the instrument of government, and the dilemma of
democracy in the world is conclusively solved.
