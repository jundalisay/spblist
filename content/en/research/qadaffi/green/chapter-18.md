## Part 3: The Social Basis of The Third Universal Theory

The social factor, the national factor, is the dynamic force of human history. The social bond, which binds together human communities from the family through the tribe to the nation, is the
basis for the movement of history.

Heroes in history are, by definition, those who have sacrificed
for causes. But what causes? They sacrificed for the sake of others, but which others? They are those with whom they maintain a relationship. Therefore, the relationship between an individual
and a group is a social one that governs the people’s dealings
amongst themselves. Nationalism, then, is the base upon which
one nation emerges. Social causes are therefore national, and
the national relationship is a social one. The social relationship
is derived from society, i.e., the relationship among members of
one nation. 

The social relationship is, therefore, a national relationship and the national is a social relationship. Even if small in number, communities or groups form one nation regardless of
the individual relationship amongst its members. What is meant
here by a community is that which is permanent because of the
common national ties that govern it.
Historic movements are mass movements, i.e., the movement
of one group in its own interests differentiated from the interests of other communities. These differentiations indicate the social characteristics that bind a community together. Mass movements are independent movements to assert the identity of a group conquered or oppressed by another group.

The struggle for authority happens within the group itself
down to the level of the family, as was explained in Part 1 of THE
GREEN BOOK: The Political Axis of the Third Universal Theory.
A group movement is a nation’s movement for its own interests.
By virtue of its national structure, each group has common social
needs which must be collectively satisfied. These needs are in no
way individualistic; they are collective needs, rights, demands,
or objectives of a nation which are linked by a single ethos. 

That
is why these movements are called national movements. Contemporary national liberation movements are themselves social
movements; they will not come to an end before every group is
liberated from the domination of another group. The world is
now passing through one of the regular cycles of the movement
of history, namely, the social struggle in support of nationalism.
In the world of man, this is as much a historical reality as it
is a social reality. That means that the national struggle – the
social struggle – is the basis of the movement of history. It is
stronger than all other factors since it is in the nature of the
human group; it is in the nature of the nation; it is the nature of
life itself. Other animals, apart from man, live in groups. Indeed,
just as the community is the basis for the survival of all groups
within the animal kingdom, so nationalism is the basis for the
survival of nations.

Nations whose nationalism is destroyed are subject to ruin.
Minorities, which are one of the main political problems in the
world, are the outcome. They are nations whose nationalism has
been destroyed and which are thus torn apart. The social factor is, therefore, a factor of life – a factor of survival. It is the nation’s
innate momentum for survival.

Nationalism in the human world and group instinct in the
animal kingdom are like gravity in the domain of material and
celestial bodies. If the sun lost its gravity, its gasses would explode and its unity would no longer exist. Accordingly, unity
is the basis for survival. The factor of unity in any group is a
social factor; in man’s case, nationalism. For this reason, human
communities struggle for their own national unity, the basis for
their survival.

The national factor, the social bond, works automatically to
impel a nation towards survival, in the same way that the gravity
of an object works to keep it as one mass surrounding its centre.
The dissolution and dispersion of atoms in an atomic bomb are
the result of the explosion of the nucleus, which is the focus of
gravitation for the particles around it. When the factor of unity
in those component systems is destroyed and gravity is lost, every atom is separately dispersed. This is the nature of matter.

It is an established natural law. To disregard it or to go against
it is damaging to life. Similarly, man’s life is damaged when he
begins to disregard nationalism – the social factor – for it is the
gravity of the group, the secret of its survival. Only the religious
factor is a rival to the social factor in influencing the unity of
a group. The religious factor may divide the national group or
unite groups with different nationalisms; however, the social factor will eventually triumph. This has been the case throughout
the ages. Historically, each nation had a religion. This was harmonious. Eventually, however, differences arose which became
a genuine cause of conflict and instability in the lives of people
throughout the ages.


A sound rule is that each nation should have a religion. For it
to be otherwise is abnormal. Such an abnormality creates an unsound situation which becomes a real cause for disputes within
one national group. There is no other solution but to be harmonious with the natural rule, i.e., each nation has a single religion.
When the social factor is compatible with the religious factor,
harmony prevails and the life of communities becomes stable,
strong, and develops soundly.

Marriage is a process that can positively or negatively influence the social factor. Though, on a natural basis of freedom,
both man and woman are free to accept whom they want and
reject whom they do not want, marriage within a group, by its
very nature, strengthens its unity and brings about collective
growth in conformity with the social factor.
