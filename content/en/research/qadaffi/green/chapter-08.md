The question arises: who has the right to supervise society, and
to point out deviations that may occur from the laws of society?
Democratically, no one group can claim this right on behalf of
society. Therefore, society alone supervises itself. It is dictatorial
for any individual or group to claim the right of the supervision
of the laws of the society, which is, democratically, the responsibility of the society as a whole. This can be arrived at through the democratic instrument of government that results from the
organization of the society itself into Basic Popular Conferences,
and through the government of these people through People’s
Committees and the General People’s Congress – the national
congress – where Secretariats of the Popular Conferences and
the People’s Committees convene. In accordance with this theory, the people become the instrument of government and, in
turn, become their own supervisors. Society thus secures selfsupervision over its laws.


## Chapter 9: How Can Society Redirect Its Course When Deviations From Its Laws Occur?

If the instrument of government is dictatorial, as is the case in
the world’s political systems today, society’s awareness of deviation from its laws is expressed only through violence to redirect its course, i.e., revolution against the instrument of government.
Violence and revolution, even though they reflect the sentiments
of society regarding deviation, do not constitute an exercise in
which the whole of society takes part. Rather, violence and revolution are carried out by those who have the capability and
courage to take the initiative and proclaim the will of society.
However, this unilateral approach is dictatorial because the revolutionary initiative in itself provides the opportunity for a new
instrument of government representing the people to arise. This
means that the governing structure remains dictatorial. In addition, violence and effecting change by force are both undemocratic, even though they take place as a reaction against an undemocratic prior condition. The society that revolves around this
concept is backward. What, then, is the solution?
The solution lies in the people being themselves the instrument of government whose authority is derived from Basic Popular Conferences and the General People’s Congress; in eliminating government administration and replacing it by People’s
Committees; and finally, in the General People’s Congress becoming a truly national convention where Basic Popular Conferences and People’s Committees convene. 

In such a system, if deviation takes place, it is then rectified
by a total democratic revision, and not through the use of force.
The process here is not a voluntary option for social change and
treatment of social ills. It is, rather, an inevitable result of the
nature of this democratic system because, in such a case, there is
no outside group who can be held responsible for such deviation
or against whom violence can be directed.



## Chapter 10: The Press

An individual has the right to express himself or herself even if
he or she behaves irrationally to demonstrate his or her insanity.
Corporate bodies too have the right to express their corporate
identity. The former represent only themselves and the latter
represent those who share their corporate identity. Since society
consists of private individuals and corporate bodies, the expression, for example, by an individual of his or her insanity does not mean that the other members of society are insane. Such
expression reflects only in the individual’s character. Likewise,
corporate expression reflects only the interest or view of those
making up the corporate body. For instance, a tobacco company,
despite the fact that what it produces is harmful to health, expresses the interests of those who make up the company.
The press is a means of expression for society: it is not a
means of expression for private individuals or corporate bodies. Therefore, logically and democratically, it should not belong to either one of them.

A newspaper owned by any individual is his or her own, and
expresses only his or her point of view. Any claim that a newspaper represents public opinion is groundless because it actually
expresses the viewpoint of that private individual. Democratically, private individuals should not be permitted to own any
public means of publication or information. However, they have
the right to express themselves by any means, even irrationally, to prove their insanity. Any journal issued by a professional sector, for example, is only a means of expression of that particular
social group. It presents their own points of view and not that
of the general public. This applies to all other corporate and
private individuals in society. 

The democratic press is that which is issued by a People’s
Committee, comprising all the groups of society. Only in this
case, and not otherwise, will the press or any other information
medium be democratic, expressing the viewpoints of the whole
society, and representing all its groups.
If medical professionals issue a journal, it must be purely
medical. Similarly, this applies to other groups. Private individuals have the right to express only their own, and not anyone else’s opinions.

What is known as the problem of the freedom of the press in
the world will be radically and democratically solved. Because it
is by-product of the problem of democracy generally, the problem of freedom of the press cannot be solved independently of
that of democracy in society as a whole. Therefore, the only solution to the persistent problem of democracy is through The
Third Universal Theory.

According to this theory, the democratic system is a cohesive structure whose foundations are firmly laid on Basic Popular Conferences and People’s Committees which convene in a
General People’s Congress. This is absolutely the only form of
genuine democratic society.

In summary, the era of the masses, which follows the age
of the republics, excites the feelings and dazzles the eyes. But
even though the vision of this era denotes genuine freedom of
the masses and their happy emancipation from the bonds of external authoritarian structures, it warns also of the dangers of
a period of chaos and demagoguery, and the threat of a return
to the authority of the individual, the sect and party, instead of
the authority of the people.

Theoretically, this is genuine democracy but, realistically, the
strong always rules, i.e., the stronger party in the society is the
one that rules.
