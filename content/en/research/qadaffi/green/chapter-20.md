A tribe is a family which has grown as a result of procreation.
It follows that a tribe is an enlarged family. Similarly, a nation is
a tribe which has grown through procreation. The nation, then,
is an enlarged tribe. The world is a nation which has been diversified into various nations. The world, then, is an enlarged
nation. The relationship which binds the family also binds the
tribe, the nation, and the world. However, it weakens with the
increase in number. The essence of humanity is that of nation,
the essence of nation is that of the tribe, and the essence of the
tribe is that of family. The degree of warmth involved in the relationship decreases proportionately with the increase in size of the social unit. This is an indisputable social fact denied only by
those who are ignorant of it.

The social bond, cohesiveness, unity, intimacy and love are
stronger at the family level than at the tribal level, stronger at
the tribal level than that of the nation, and stronger at the level
of the nation than that of the world.

Advantages, privileges, values and ideals based on social
bonds exist where those bonds are natural and undoubtedly
strong. They are stronger at the family level than at the level
of the tribe, stronger at the tribal level than that of the nation,
and stronger at the nation’s level than that of the world. Thus,
these social bonds, benefits, advantages and ideals associated
with them are lost wherever the family, the tribe, the nation or humankind vanish or are lost. It is, therefore, of great importance for human society to maintain the cohesiveness of the
family, the tribe, the nation and the world in order to benefit
from the advantages, privileges, values and ideals yielded by
the solidarity, cohesiveness, unity, intimacy and love of family,
tribe, nation and humanity.

In the social sense, the familial society is better than that of
the tribe, the tribal society is better than that of the nation, and
the society of the nation is better than world society with respect
to fellowship, affection, solidarity and benefits.



## Chapter 21: The Merits Of The Tribe

Since the tribe is a large family, it provides its members with
much the same material benefits and social advantages that the
family provides for its members, for the tribe is a secondary
family. What must be emphasized is that, in the context of the
tribe, an individual might indulge himself in an uncouth manner, something which he would not do within the family. However, because of the smallness in size of the family, immediate
supervision is not exercised, unlike the tribe whose members
continually feel that they are under its supervision. In view of
these considerations, the tribe forms a behaviour pattern for
its members, developing into a social education which is better and more noble than any school education. The tribe is a
social school where its members are raised to absorb the high
ideals which develop into a behaviour pattern for life. These become automatically rooted as the human being grows, unlike
classroom education with its curricula – formally dictated and
gradually lost with the growth of the individual. This is so because it is formal and compulsory and because the individual is aware of the fact that it is dictated to him.

The tribe is a natural social “umbrella” for social security. By
virtue of social tribal traditions, the tribe provides for its members collective protection in the form of fines, revenge and defence; namely, social protection. Blood is the prime factor in the
formation of the tribe, but it is not the only one because affiliation is also a factor in the formation of the tribe. With the passage of time, the differences between the factors of blood and affiliation disappear, leaving the tribe as one social and physical unit,
though it remains fundamentally a unit of blood in origin.
