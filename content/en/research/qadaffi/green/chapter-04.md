The political class system is the same as a party, tribal, or sectarian system since a class dominates society in the same way that a party, tribe or sect would. Classes, like parties, sects or
tribes, are groups of people within society who share common
interests. Common interests arise from the existence of a group
of people bound together by blood-relationship, belief, culture,
locality or standard of living. Classes, parties, sects and tribes
emerge because blood-relationship, social rank, economic interest, standard of living, belief, culture and locality create a common outlook to achieve a common end. Thus, social structures,
in the form of classes, parties, tribes or sects, emerge. These
eventually develop into political entities directed toward the realization of the goals of that group. In all cases, the people are
neither the class, the party, the tribe, nor the sect, for these are
no more than a segment of the people and constitute a minority.
If a class, a party, a tribe, or a sect dominates a society, then the
dominant system becomes a dictatorship. However, a class or a
tribal coalition is preferable to a party coalition since societies
originally consisted of tribal communities. One seldom finds a
group of people who do not belong to a tribe, and all people
belong to a specific class. But no party or parties embrace all of
the people, and therefore the party or party coalition represents
a minority compared to the masses outside their membership.

Under genuine democracy, there can be no justification for any
one class to subdue other classes for its interests. Similarly, no
party, tribe or sect can crush others for their own interests.
To allow such actions abandons the logic of democracy and
justifies resort to the use of force. Such policies of suppression
are dictatorial because they are not in the interest of the whole
society, which consists of more than one class, tribe or sect, or
the members of one party. There is no justification for such actions, though the dictatorial argument is that society actually consists of numerous segments, one of which must undertake
the liquidation of others in order to remain solely in power. This
exercise is not, accordingly, in the interests of the whole society
but, rather, in the interests of a specific class, tribe, sect, party, or
those who claim to speak for the society. Such an act is basically
aimed at the member of the society who does not belong to the
party, class, tribe or sect which carries out the liquidation.
A society torn apart by party feud is similar to one which is
torn apart by tribal or sectarian conflicts.


A party that is formed in the name of a class inevitably becomes a substitute for that class and continues in the process of
spontaneous transformation until it becomes hostile to the class
that it replaces.
Any class which inherits a society also inherits its characteristics. If the working class, for example, subdues all other classes
of a particular society, it then becomes its only heir and forms
its material and social base. The heir acquires the traits of those
from whom it inherits, though this may not be evident all at
once. With the passage of time, characteristics of the other eliminated classes will emerge within the ranks of the working class
itself. The members of the new society will assume the attitudes and perspectives appropriate to their newly evolved characteristics. Thus, the working class will develop a separate society
possessing all of the contradictions of the old society. In the first
stage, the material standard and importance of the members become unequal. Thereafter, groups emerge which automatically
become classes that are the same as the classes that were eliminated. Thus, the struggle for domination of the society begins again. Each group of people, each faction, and each new class
will all vie to become the instrument of government.
Being social in nature, the material base of any society is
changeable. The instrument of government of this material base
may be sustained for some time, but it will eventual become obsolete as new material and social standards evolve to form a new
material base. Any society which undergoes a class conflict may
at one time have been a one-class society but, through evolution,
inevitably becomes a multi-class society.
The class that expropriates and acquires the possession of others to maintain power for itself will soon find that, through evolution, it will be itself subject to change as though it were the
society as a whole.

In summary, all attempts at unifying the material base of
a society in order to solve the problem of government, or at
putting an end to the struggle in favour of a party, class, sect or
tribe have failed. All endeavours aimed at appeasing the masses
through the election of representatives or through parliaments
have equally failed. To continue such practices would be a waste
of time and a mockery of the people.
