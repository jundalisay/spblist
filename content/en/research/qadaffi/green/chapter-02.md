Parliaments are the backbone of that conventional democracy prevailing in the world today. Parliament is a misrepresentation of the people, and parliamentary systems are a false solution to
the problem of democracy. 

A parliament is originally founded to represent the people, but this in itself is undemocratic as democracy means the authority of the people and not an authority acting on their behalf. The mere existence of a parliament means
the absence of the people. True democracy exists only through the direct participation of the people, and not through the activity of their representatives. Parliaments have been a legal barrier between the people and the exercise of authority, excluding the masses from meaningful politics and monopolizing sovereignty in their place. People are left with only a facade of democracy, manifested in long queues to cast their election ballots. 

To lay bare the character of parliaments, one has to examine their origin. They are either elected from constituencies, a
party, or a coalition of parties, or are appointed. But all of these
procedures are undemocratic, for dividing the population into
constituencies means that one member of parliament represents
thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of people, depending on the size of the population. It also means that a
member keeps few popular organizational links with the electors since he, like other members, is considered a representative of the whole people. This is what the prevailing traditional democracy requires. The masses are completely isolated from the representative and he, in turn, is totally removed from them.
Immediately after winning the electors’ votes the representative
takes over the people’s sovereignty and acts on their behalf. The
prevailing traditional democracy endows the member of parliament with a sacredness and immunity which are denied to the
rest of the people. Parliaments, therefore, have become a means
of plundering and usurping the authority of the people. It has
thus become the right of the people to struggle, through popular revolution, to destroy such instruments – the so-called parliamentary assemblies which usurp democracy and sovereignty,
and which stifle the will of the people. The masses have the right
to proclaim reverberantly the new principle: no representation
in lieu of the people.

If parliament is formed from one party as a result of its winning an election, it becomes a parliament of the winning party
and not of the people. It represents the party and not the people, and the executive power of the parliament becomes that
of the victorious party and not of the people. The same is true
of the parliament of proportional representation in which each
party holds a number of seats proportional to their success in the
popular vote. 

The members of the parliament represent their respective parties and not the people, and the power established
by such a coalition is the power of the combined parties and not
that of the people. Under such systems, the people are the victims whose votes are vied for by exploitative competing factions
who dupe the people into political circuses that are outwardly
noisy and frantic, but inwardly powerless and irrelevant. Alternatively, the people are seduced into standing in long, apathetic,
silent queues to cast their ballots in the same way that they throw waste paper into dustbins. This is the traditional democracy prevalent in the whole world, whether it is represented by
a one-party, two-party, multiparty or non-party system. Thus it
is clear that representation is a fraud. 

Moreover, since the system of elected parliaments is based
on propaganda to win votes, it is a demagogic system in the
real sense of the word. Votes can be bought and falsified. Poor
people are unable to compete in the election campaigns, and the
result is that only the rich get elected. Assemblies constituted
by appointment or hereditary succession do not fall under any
form of democracy.

Philosophers, thinkers, and writers advocated the theory of
representative parliaments at a time when peoples were unconsciously herded like sheep by kings, sultans and conquerors.
The ultimate aspiration of the people of those times was to
have someone to represent them before such rulers. When even
this aspiration was rejected, people waged bitter and protracted
struggle to attain this goal.

After the successful establishment of the age of the republics
and the beginning of the era of the masses, it is unthinkable
that democracy should mean the electing of only a few representatives to act on behalf of great masses. This is an obsolete
structure. Authority must be in the hands of all of the people.
The most tyrannical dictatorships the world has known have
existed under the aegis of parliaments.
