What is a minority? What are its rights and responsibilities? How can the problem of minorities be solved according to the solution to various human problems presented by The Third Universal Theory?

There are only two types of minorities. 

1. The one provided by the nation with a social framework

2. The other has no nation and forms its own social framework.

The latter is the one that forms one of the historic groups which eventually constitute a nation by virtue of a sense of belonging and a common destiny.

Such a minority has its own social rights. Any encroachment on these rights by any majority is an act of injustice. Social characteristics are inherent and cannot be given or taken away.

The political and economic problems of minorities can only be solved within a society controlled by the masses in whose hands power, wealth and arms should be placed. 

To view the minority as a political and economic substrata is dictatorial and unjust.



## Chapter 25: Black People Will Prevail In The World

The latest age of slavery has been the enslavement of Blacks by White people.

The memory of this age will persist in the thinking of Black people until they have vindicated themselves. This tragic and historic event, the resulting bitter feeling, and the yearning or the vindication of a whole race, constitute a psychological motivation of Black people to vengeance and triumph that cannot be disregarded. 

In addition, the inevitable cycle of social history, which includes the Yellow people’s domination of the world when it marched from Asia, and the White people’s carrying out a wide-ranging colonialist movement covering all the continents of the world, is now giving way to the re-emergence of Black people.

Black people are now in a very backward social situation, but such backwardness works to bring about their numerical superiority because their low standard of living has shielded them from methods of birth control and family planning.

Also, their old social traditions place no limit on marriages, leading to their accelerated growth. 

The population of other races has decreased because of birth control, restrictions on marriage, and constant occupation in work, unlike the Blacks, who tend to be less obsessive about work in a climate which is continuously hot.
