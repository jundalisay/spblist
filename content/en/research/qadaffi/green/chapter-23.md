It is an undisputed fact that both man and woman are human
beings. It follows, as a self-evident fact, that woman and man are
equal as human beings. Discrimination against woman by man
is a flagrant act of oppression without justification for woman
eats and drinks as man eats and drinks; woman loves and hates
as man loves and hates; woman thinks, learns and comprehends as man thinks, learns and comprehends. Woman, like
man, needs shelter, clothing, and transportation; woman feels
hunger and thirst as man feels hunger and thirst; woman lives
and dies as man lives and dies.

But why are there men and women? Human society is composed neither of men alone nor of women alone. It is made up
naturally of men and women. Why were not only men created?

Why were not only women created? After all, what is the difference between men and women or man and woman? Why was it necessary to create men and women? There must be a natural necessity for the existence of man and woman, rather than man only or woman only. It follows that neither of them is exactly like the other, and the fact that a natural difference exists between men and women is proved by the created existence of men and women. This necessarily means that there is a role for each one of them corresponding to the difference between them. Accordingly, there must be different prevailing conditions for each one in order that they perform their naturally different roles. To comprehend these roles, we must understand the difference in the created nature of man and woman, that is, the natural difference between the two.

Women are females and men are males. According to gynaecologists, women menstruate every month or so, while men, being male, do not menstruate or suffer during the monthly period. A woman, being a female, is naturally subject to monthly
bleeding. When a woman does not menstruate, she is pregnant.
If she is pregnant, she becomes, due to pregnancy, less active
for about a year, which means that all her natural activities are
seriously reduced until she delivers her baby. When she delivers
her baby or has a miscarriage, she suffers puerperium, a condition attendant on delivery or miscarriage. As man does not get pregnant, he is not liable to the conditions which women, being
female, suffer. Afterwards a woman may breast-feed the baby
she bore. Breast-feeding continues for about two years. Breastfeeding means that a woman is so inseparable from her baby
that her activity is seriously reduced. She becomes directly responsible for another person whom she assists in his or her biological functions; without this assistance that person would die.
The man, on the other hand, neither conceives nor breast-feeds.
End of gynaecological statement!

All these innate characteristics form differences because of
which men and women are not the same. These characteristics
in themselves are the realities that define male and female, men
and women; they assign to each of them a different role or function in life. This means that men cannot replace women in carrying out these functions. It is worthy of consideration that these
biological functions are a heavy burden, causing women great effort and suffering. However, without these functions which
women perform, human life would come to an end. It follows
that it is a natural function which is neither voluntary nor compulsory. It is an essential function, without which human life would come to a complete halt.

Deliberate interventions against conception form an alternative to human life. In addition to that, there exists partial deliberate intervention against conception, as well as against breastfeeding. All these are links in a chain of actions in contradiction to natural life, which is tantamount to murder. For a woman to
kill herself in order not to conceive, deliver and breast-feed is
within the realm of deliberate, artificial interventions, in contradiction with the nature of life epitomized by marriage, conception, breast-feeding, and maternity. They differ only in degree.
To dispense with the natural role of woman in maternity –
nurseries replacing mothers – is a start in dispensing with the
human society and transforming it into a merely biological society with an artificial way of life. To separate children from
their mothers and to cram them into nurseries is a process by
which they are transformed into something very close to chicks,
for nurseries are similar to poultry farms into which chicks are
crammed after they are hatched. Nothing else would be as appropriate and suitable to the human being and his dignity as
natural motherhood. 

Children should be raised by their mothers
in a family where the true principles of motherhood, fatherhood
and comradeship of brothers and sisters prevail, and not in an
institution resembling a poultry farm. Even poultry, like the rest
of the members of the animal kingdom, need motherhood as
a natural phase. Therefore, breeding them on farms similar to
nurseries is against their natural growth. Even their meat is artificial rather than natural. Meat from mechanized poultry farms is not tasty and may not be nourishing because the chicks are
not naturally bred and are not raised in the protective shade of
natural motherhood. The meat of wild birds is more tasty and
nourishing because they are naturally fed. As for children who
have neither family nor shelter, society is their guardian, and
only for them, should society establish nurseries and related institutions. It is better for them to be taken care of by society
rather than by individuals who are not their parents.
If a test were carried out to discover whether the natural
propensity of the child is towards its mother or the nursery.
the child would opt for the mother and not the nursery. Since
the natural tendency of a child is towards its mother, she is the
natural and proper person to give the child the protection of
nursing. Sending a child to a nursery in place of its mother is
coercive and oppressive and against its free and natural tendencies.
Natural growth for all living things is free and healthy
growth. To substitute a nursery for a mother is coercive action against free and sound growth. Children who are shipped
off to a nursery are consigned compulsorily or by exploitation
and simple-mindedness. 

They are driven to nurseries purely
by materialistic, and not by social, considerations. If coercion
and childish simple-mindedness were removed, they would certainly reject the nursery and cling to their mothers. The only
justification for such an unnatural and inhuman process is the
fact that the woman is in a position unsuitable to her nature,
i.e., she is compelled to perform duties which are unsocial and
anti-motherhood.

A woman, whose created nature has assigned to her a natural role different from that of man, must be in an appropriate
position to perform her natural role.
Motherhood is the female’s function, not the male’s. Consequently, it is unnatural to separate children from their mothers.
Any attempt to take children away from their mothers is coercion, oppression and dictatorship. The mother who abandons
her maternity contradicts her natural role in life. She must be
provided with her rights, and with conditions which are noncoercive, unoppressive and appropriate to her natural role. She
can then fulfill her natural role under natural conditions. If the
woman is forced to abandon her natural role regarding conception and maternity, she falls victim to coercion and tyranny. A
woman who needs work that renders her unable to perform her
natural function is not free and is compelled to work by need,
and “in need, freedom is latent”.

Among suitable and even essential conditions which enable
women to perform their natural role, which differs from that
of men, are those very conditions which are proper for a human being who is incapacitated and burdened with pregnancy.
Bearing another human being in her womb lessens her physical
ability. It is unjust to place such a woman, in this stage of maternity, into circumstances of physical work incompatible with her condition. For pregnant women to perform such physical work
is tantamount to punishment for their betrayal of their maternal
role; it is the tax they pay for entering the realm of men, which
is naturally alien to their own.

The belief, even if it is held by a woman, that she carries out
physical labour of her own accord, is not, in fact, true. She performs the physical work only because a harsh materialistic society has placed her (without her being directly aware of it) into
coercive circumstances. She has no alternative but to submit to
the conditions of that society, even though she may think that
she works of her own accord. In fact, the alleged basis that “there
is no difference in any way between men and women”, deprives
woman of her freedom.

The phrase “in any way” is a monstrous deception. This idea
will destroy the appropriate and necessary conditions which
constitute the privilege which women ought to enjoy apart from
men in accordance with their distinctive nature, and upon which
their natural role in life is based.

To demand equality between man and woman in carrying
heavy weights while the woman is pregnant is unjust and cruel.
To demand equality between them in fasting and hardship while
she is breast-feeding is unjust and cruel. To demand equality
between them in any dirty work which stains her beauty and
detracts from her femininity is unjust and cruel. Education that
leads to work unsuitable for her nature is unjust and cruel as
well.

There is no difference between men and women in all that
concerns humanity. None of them should marry the other
against his or her will, or divorce without a just trial or mutual agreement. Neither should a woman remarry without such
agreement or divorce; nor a man without divorce or consent. The
woman is the owner of the house because it is one of the suitable and necessary conditions for a woman who menstruates,
conceives, and cares for her children. The female is the owner
of the maternity shelter, which is the house. Even in the animal
world, which differs in many ways from that of the humans, and
where maternity is also a duty according to nature, it is coercive to deprive the female of her shelter and the offspring of their
mother.

Woman is female. Being female means she has a biological
nature that is different from that of the male. The female’s biological nature, differing as it does from that of the males, has
imparted to women characteristics different from those of men
in form and in essence. A woman’s anatomy is different from
that of a man’s just as the female differs in plants and animals.
This is a natural and incontrovertible fact. In the animal and
plant kingdoms, the male is naturally created strong and aggressive, while the female is created beautiful and gentle. 

These
are natural and eternal characteristics innate to living creatures,
whether they are called human beings, animals or plants.
In view of his different nature and in line with the laws of
nature, the male has played the role of the strong and striving
not by design, but simply because he is created that way. The
female has played the role of the beautiful and the gentle involuntarily because she was created so. This natural rule is just,
partly because it is natural, and partly because it is the basic rule
for freedom. All living creatures are created free and any interference with that freedom is coercion. Not to adhere to these
natural roles and to lack concern for their limits amounts to a
wanton act of corruption against the values of life itself. Nature
has been designed to be in harmony with the inevitability of life,
from what is being to what will become. The living creature is a
being who inevitably lives until it is dead. Existence between the
beginning and the end of life is based on a natural law, without
choice or compulsion. It is natural. It is natural freedom.
In the animal, plant and human realms, there must be a male
and a female for life to occur from its beginning to its end. Not only do they exist but they have to exercise, with absolute efficiency, the natural role for which they have been created. If
their role is not being efficiently performed, there must be some
defect in the organization of life caused by historical circumstances. This is the case of societies almost everywhere in the
world today as they confuse the roles of men and women and
endeavour to transform women into men. In harmony with nature and its subsequent purpose, men and women must be creative within their respective roles. To resist is retrogressive; it is
directed against nature and destroys the basis of freedom, for it
is hostile to both life and survival. Men and women must perform, not abandon, the roles for which they are created.
Abandoning their role, or even a part of it, only occurs as a
result of coercive conditions and under abnormal circumstances.


The woman who rejects pregnancy, marriage, beautification and
femininity for reasons of health abandons her natural role in life
under these coercive conditions of ill health. The woman who
rejects marriage, pregnancy or motherhood because of work
abandons her natural role under similar coercive conditions. The
woman who rejects marriage, pregnancy or maternity without
any concrete cause abandons her natural role as a result of a
coercive and morally deviant circumstances. Thus, abandoning
the natural roles of female and male in life can only occur under
unnatural conditions which are contrary to freedom and are a
threat to survival. Consequently, there must be a world revolution which puts an end to all materialistic conditions hindering women from performing their natural role in life, and so drives
them to carry out men’s duties in order to attain equal rights.
Such revolution will inevitably take place, particularly in industrial societies, as a response to the instinct of survival, even without any instigator of revolution such as THE GREEN BOOK.
All societies today look upon women as little more than commodities. The East regards her as a commodity to be bought and
sold, while the West does not recognize her femininity.

Driving woman to do man’s work is a flagrant aggression
against the femininity with which she is naturally provided and
which defines a natural purpose essential to life. Man’s work obscures woman’s beautiful features which are created for female roles. They are like blossoms which are created to attract pollen
and to produce seeds. If we did away with the blossoms, the role
of plants in life would come to an end. The natural embellishment in butterflies and birds and animal females exists to that natural vital purpose. If a woman carries out men’s work, she
risks being transformed into a man, abandoning her role and
her beauty. A woman has full right to live without being forced
to change into a man and to give up her femininity.
Physical structure, which is naturally different in men and
women, leads to differences in the functions of the organs, which
in turn leads to differences in the psyche, mood, emotions, as
well as in physical appearance. A woman is tender; a woman is
pretty; a woman weeps easily and is easily frightened. In general, women are gentle and men are aggressive by virtue of their inbred nature.

To ignore natural differences between men and women and
to mix their roles is an absolutely uncivilized attitude, hostile
to the laws of nature, destructive to human life, and a genuine
cause for the wretchedness of human social life.
Modern industrial societies, which have made women adapt
to the same physical work as men at the expense of their femininity and their natural role in terms of beauty, maternity and serenity, are materialistic and uncivilized. To imitate them is as
stupid as it is dangerous to civilization and humanity.
The question, then, is not whether women should or should
not work, for this is a ridiculous materialistic presentation of
the case. Work should be provided by the society to all able
members who need work – men and women on the condition
that individuals work in their own fields and not be coerced into
carrying out unsuitable work.

For children to find themselves under adult working conditions is unjust and dictatorial. It is equally unjust and dictatorial
for women to find themselves under the working conditions of
men.

Freedom means that every human being gets proper education which qualifies him or her for the work which suits him
or her. Dictatorship means that human beings are taught that
which is not suitable for them, and are forced to do unsuitable
work. Work which is appropriate to men is not necessarily appropriate to women, and knowledge that is proper for children
does not necessarily suit adults.
There is no difference in human rights between man and
woman, the child and the adult, but there is no absolute identity
between them as regards their duties, effort and suffering. However, without these functions which
women perform, human life would come to an end. It follows
that it is a natural function which is neither voluntary nor compulsory. It is an essential function, without which human life would come to a complete halt.
