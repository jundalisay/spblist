Artificial selection has shown how our domestic races have adaptations in their structure or habits based on human design.

<!-- We can, I think, further understand the frequently abnormal character ofour domestic races, and likewise their differences being so great in external characters and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs.  , or only with much difficulty, any deviation of structure excepting such as is -->

Humans can only select externally visible features. We rarely care for what is internal.

<!-- He can never act by selection, excepting on variations which are first given to him in some slight degree by nature. -->

A man will only try to make a fantail if he saw a pigeon with an unusual tail.

 <!-- developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner, or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual size;  -->

The more unusual any feature, the more likely it would be to catch human attention. 

<!-- But to use such an expression as trying to make a fantail, is, I have no doubt, in most cases, utterly incorrect.  -->

The man who first selected a pigeon with a larger tail, never dreamed what its descendants would look like through long-continued, partly unconscious and partly methodical selection. 

<!-- Perhaps the parent bird of all fantails had only fourteen tail-feathers somewhat expanded, like the present Java fantail, or like individuals of other and distinct breeds, in which as many as seventeen tail-feathers have been counted.

Perhaps the first pouter-pigeon did not inflate its crop much more than the turbit now does the upper part of its oesophagus,--a habit which is disregarded by all fanciers, as it is not one of the points of the breed. -->

<!-- Nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would be necessary to catch the fancier's eye: he perceives extremely small differences, and it is in human nature to value any novelty, however slight, in one's own possession. Nor must the value which would formerly be set on any slight differences in the individuals of the same species, be judged of by the value which would now be set on them, after several breeds have once fairly been established. -->

Many slight differences might arise amongst pigeons which are rejected as faults or deviations from the  perfection of each breed.

<!-- The common goose has not given rise to any marked varieties; hence the Thoulouse and the common breed, which differ only in colour, that most fleeting of characters, have lately been exhibited as distinct at our poultry-shows.

I think these views further explain what has sometimes been noticed--namely that  -->

We know nothing about the origin or history of any of our domestic breeds. 

A breed, like a dialect of a language, can hardly have a definite origin.


A man either breeds:
- from an individual with a slight deviation of structure, or 
- from his best animals and thus improves them

<!-- takes more care than usual in matching , and the improved individuals slowly spread in the immediate neighbourhood.  -->

The improved breeds do not get a distinct name and their history will be disregarded because they have little value.

When further improved by the same slow and gradual process, they will spread more widely and get recognised as something distinct and valuable and so get a provincial name. 

<!-- In semi-civilised countries, with little free communication, the spreading and knowledge of any new sub-breed will be a slow process. As soon as the points of value of the new sub-breed are once fully acknowledged, the principle, as I have called it, of unconscious selection will always tend,--perhaps more at one period than at another, as the breed rises or falls in fashion,--perhaps more in one district than in another, according to the state of civilisation of the inhabitants--slowly to add to the characteristic features of the breed, whatever they may be. But the chance will be infinitely small of any record having been preserved of such slow, varying, and insensible changes. -->

<!-- I must now say a few words on the circumstances, favourable, or the reverse, to man's power of selection.  -->

A high degree of variability is obviously favourable as it freely gives the materials for selection to work on.

 <!-- not that mere individual differences are not amply sufficient, with extremecare, to allow of the accumulation of a large amount of modification in almost any desired direction.  -->

<!-- But as variations manifestly useful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally, the chance of their appearance will be much increased by a large number of individuals being kept; and hence this comes to be of the highest importance to success. On this principle Marshall has remarked, with respect to the sheep of parts of Yorkshire, that 'as they generally belong to poor people, and are mostly in small lots, they never can be improved.'

On the other hand, nurserymen, from raising large stocks of the same plants, are generally far more successful than amateurs in getting new and valuable varieties. The keeping of a large number of individuals of a species in any country requires that the species should be placed under favourable conditions of life, so as to breed freely in that country. -->

When the individuals of any species are scanty, all the individuals will be allowed to breed.
- This prevents selection.

Most importantly, the organism should be so highly valued by man that the closest attention should be paid to the slightest deviation in the qualities or structure of each individual.

Unless such attention be paid nothing can be effected. 

The strawberry began to vary just when gardeners began to attend closely to it.

The strawberry had always varied since it was cultivated. But the slight varieties had been neglected.

However, gardeners picked out individual plants with slightly larger, earlier, or better fruit, and raised seedlings from them. They again picked out the best seedlings and bred from them.

There appeared (aided by some crossing with distinct species) those many admirable strawberry varieties.

 <!-- of the  which have been raised during the last thirty or forty years. -->

In the case of animals with separate sexes, preventing crosses is important in creating new races.
- This is true at least, in a country which is already stocked with other races.

In this respect, enclosure of the land plays a part.

Wandering savages or the inhabitants of open plains rarely possess more than one breed of the same species.

Pigeons can be mated for life. This is a great convenience to the breeder so that many races may be kept true, though mingled in the same aviary. This has favoured the improvement and formation of new breeds.

Pigeons can be propagated in great numbers quickly. Inferior birds may be freely rejected, as when killed they serve for food.

On the other hand, cats cannot be matched because of their nocturnal rambling habits.

We hardly ever see a distinct breed kept up. Such breeds are usually imported, often from islands.

<!-- Although I do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less than others, yet  -->

The rarity or absence of distinct breeds of cat, donkey, peacock, goose, &c. is from selection not being brought into play.
- Cats are difficult to pair. There are only a few donkeys kept by poor people.
- Little attention paid to their breeding.
- Peacocks are not easily reared and a large stock not kept.
- Geese are valuable only for food and feathers.

<!-- , and more especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of distinct breeds. -->

To sum up on the origin of our Domestic Races of animals and plants. I believe that

The most important cause of variability is the conditions of life on the reproductive system. 

Variability is not an inherent and necessary contingency under all circumstances with all organic beings.

The effects of variability are modified by various degrees of inheritance and of reversion. 

Variability is governed by many unknown laws, more especially by that of correlation of growth.

Something may be attributed to:
- the direct action of the conditions of life.
- use and disuse

The final result is thus rendered infinitely complex.

In some cases, the intercrossing of species, aboriginally distinct, has played an important part in the origin of our domestic productions.

When in any country several domestic breeds have once been established, their occasional intercrossing, with the aid of selection, has largely aided the formation of new sub-breeds.

But the importance of the crossing of varieties has been greatly exaggerated, both in regard to animals and to plants propagated by seed.

In plants which are temporarily propagated by cuttings, buds, &c., the importance of the crossing both of distinct species and of varieties is immense.

The cultivator here quite disregards the extreme variability both of hybrids and mongrels, and the frequent sterility of hybrids.

But the cases of plants not propagated by seed are of little importance to us, for their endurance is only temporary. 


The accumulative action of Selection is by far the predominant Power over all these causes of Change whether applied:
- methodically and more quickly, or
- unconsciously and more slowly, but more efficiently
