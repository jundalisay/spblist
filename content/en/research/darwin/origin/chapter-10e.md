On this same theory, the fauna of any great period in the earth's history will be intermediate in general character between that which preceded and that which succeeded it. Thus, the species which lived at the sixth great stage of descent in the diagram are the modified offspring of those which lived at the fifth stage, and are the parents of those which became still more
modified at the seventh stage; 

Hence they could hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in character between the forms of life above and below. We must, however, allow for the entire extinction of some preceding forms, and for the coming in of quite new forms by immigration, and for a large amount of modification, during the long and blank intervals between the successive formations.

Subject to these allowances, the fauna of each geological period undoubtedly is intermediate in character, between the preceding and succeeding faunas. I need give only one instance, namely, the manner in which the fossils of the Devonian system, when this system was first discovered, were at once recognised by palaeontologists as intermediate in character between those of the overlying carboniferous, and underlying Silurian system. But each fauna is not necessarily exactly
intermediate, as unequal intervals of time have elapsed between consecutive formations.

It is no real objection to the truth of the statement, that the fauna of each period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character between the preceding and succeeding faunas, that certain genera offer exceptions to the rule. For instance, mastodons and elephants, when arranged by Dr. Falconer in two series, first according to their mutual affinities and then according to their periods of existence, do not accord in arrangement. The species extreme in character are not the oldest, or the most recent; nor are those which are intermediate in character, intermediate in age. 

But supposing for an instant, in this and other such cases, that the record of the first appearance and disappearance of the
species was perfect, we have no reason to believe that forms successively produced necessarily
endure for corresponding lengths of time: a very ancient form might occasionally last much longer
than a form elsewhere subsequently produced, especially in the case of terrestrial productions
inhabiting separated districts. To compare small things with great: if the principal living and
extinct races of the domestic pigeon were arranged as well as they could be in serial affinity, this
arrangement would not closely accord with the order in time of their production, and still less with
the order of their disappearance; for the parent rock-pigeon now lives; and many varieties between
the rock-pigeon and the carrier have become extinct; and carriers which are extreme in the
important character of length of beak originated earlier than short-beaked tumblers, which are at the
opposite end of the series in this same respect.

Closely connected with the statement, that the organic remains from an intermediate formation are
in some degree intermediate in character, is the fact, insisted on by all palaeontologists, that fossils
from two consecutive formations are far more closely related to each other, than are the fossils
from two remote formations. Pictet gives as a well-known instance, the general resemblance of theorganic remains from the several stages of the chalk formation, though the species are distinct in each stage.

This fact alone, from its generality, seems to have shaken Professor Pictet in his firm
belief in the immutability of species. He who is acquainted with the distribution of existing species
over the globe, will not attempt to account for the close resemblance of the distinct species in
closely consecutive formations, by the physical conditions of the ancient areas having remained
nearly the same. Let it be remembered that the forms of life, at least those inhabiting the sea, have
changed almost simultaneously throughout the world, and therefore under the most different
climates and conditions. Consider the prodigious vicissitudes of climate during the pleistocene
period, which includes the whole glacial period, and note how little the specific forms of the
inhabitants of the sea have been affected.

On the theory of descent, the full meaning of the fact of fossil remains from closely consecutive
formations, though ranked as distinct species, being closely related, is obvious. As the
accumulation of each formation has often been interrupted, and as long blank intervals have
intervened between successive formations, we ought not to expect to find, as I attempted to show in
the last chapter, in any one or two formations all the intermediate varieties between the species
which appeared at the commencement and close of these periods; but we ought to find after
intervals, very long as measured by years, but only moderately long as measured geologically,
closely allied forms, or, as they have been called by some authors, representative species; and these
we assuredly do find. We find, in short, such evidence of the slow and scarcely sensible mutation
of specific forms, as we have a just right to expect to find.

On the state of Development of Ancient Forms. -- There has been much discussion whether recent
forms are more highly developed than ancient. I will not here enter on this subject, for naturalists
have not as yet defined to each other's satisfaction what is meant by high and low forms. But in
one particular sense the more recent forms must, on my theory, be higher than the more ancient; for
each new species is formed by having had some advantage in the struggle for life over other and
preceding forms. If under a nearly similar climate, the eocene inhabitants of one quarter of the
world were put into competition with the existing inhabitants of the same or some other quarter, the
eocene fauna or flora would certainly be beaten and exterminated; as would a secondary fauna by
an eocene, and a palaeozoic fauna by a secondary fauna. 

I do not doubt that this process of improvement has affected in a marked and sensible manner the organisation of the more recent and victorious forms of life, in comparison with the ancient and beaten forms; but I can see no way of
testing this sort of progress. Crustaceans, for instance, not the highest in their own class, may have
beaten the highest molluscs. From the extraordinary manner in which European productions have
recently spread over New Zealand, and have seized on places which must have been previously
occupied, we may believe, if all the animals and plants of Great Britain were set free in New
Zealand, that in the course of time a multitude of British forms would become thoroughly
naturalized there, and would exterminate many of the natives. On the other hand, from what we see
now occurring in New Zealand, and from hardly a single inhabitant of the southern hemisphere
having become wild in any part of Europe, we may doubt, if all the productions of New Zealand
were set free in Great Britain, whether any considerable number would be enabled to seize on
places now occupied by our native plants and animals. Under this point of view, the productions of
Great Britain may be said to be higher than those of New Zealand. 

Yet the most skilful naturalist from an examination of the species of the two countries could not have foreseen this result.Agassiz insists that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of recent animals of
the same classes; or that the geological succession of extinct forms is in some degree parallel to the
embryological development of recent forms. I must follow Pictet and Huxley in thinking that the
truth of this doctrine is very far from proved. Yet I fully expect to see it hereafter confirmed, at
least in regard to subordinate groups, which have branched off from each other within
comparatively recent times. For this doctrine of Agassiz accords well with the theory of natural
selection. In a future chapter I shall attempt to show that the adult differs from its embryo, owing
to variations supervening at a not early age, and being inherited at a corresponding age. This
process, whilst it leaves the embryo almost unaltered, continually adds, in the course of successive
generations, more and more difference to the adult.


Thus the embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture, preserved by nature, of the ancient and less
modified condition of each animal. This view may be true, and yet it may never be capable of full
proof. Seeing, for instance, that the oldest known mammals, reptiles, and fish strictly belong to
their own proper classes, though some of these old forms are in a slight degree less distinct from
each other than are the typical members of the same groups at the present day, it would be vain to
look for animals having the common embryological character of the Vertebrata, until beds far
beneath the lowest Silurian strata are discovered--a discovery of which the chance is very small.
On the Succession of the same Types within the same areas, during the later tertiary periods. -- Mr.
Clift many years ago showed that the fossil mammals from the Australian caves were closely allied
to the living marsupials of that continent. 

In South America, a similar relationship is manifest,
even to an uneducated eye, in the gigantic pieces of armour like those of the armadillo, found in
several parts of La Plata; and Professor Owen has shown in the most striking manner that most of
the fossil mammals, buried there in such numbers, are related to South American types. This
relationship is even more clearly seen in the wonderful collection of fossil bones made by MM.
Lund and Clausen in the caves of Brazil. I was so much impressed with these facts that I strongly
insisted, in 1839 and 1845, on this 'law of the succession of types,'--on 'this wonderful relationship
in the same continent between the dead and the living.' Professor Owen has subsequently extended
the same generalisation to the mammals of the Old World. We see the same law in this author's
restorations of the extinct and gigantic birds of New Zealand. We see it also in the birds of the
caves of Brazil. Mr. Woodward has shown that the same law holds good with sea-shells, but from
the wide distribution of most genera of molluscs, it is not well displayed by them. Other cases
could be added, as the relation between the extinct and living land-shells of Madeira; and between
the extinct and living brackish-water shells of the Aralo-Caspian Sea.

Now what does this remarkable law of the succession of the same types within the same areas
mean? He would be a bold man, who after comparing the present climate of Australia and of parts
of South America under the same latitude, would attempt to account, on the one hand, by dissimilar
physical conditions for the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of these two continents, and, on the other
hand, by similarity of conditions, for the uniformity of the same types in each during the later
tertiary periods. Nor can it be pretended that it is an immutable law that marsupials should have
been chiefly or solely produced in Australia; or that Edentata and other American types should
have been solely produced in South America. For we know that Europe in ancient times was
peopled by numerous marsupials; and I have shown in the publications above alluded to, that in
America the law of distribution of terrestrial mammals was formerly different from what it now is.
North America formerly partook strongly of the present character of the southern half of thecontinent; and the southern half was formerly more closely allied, than it is at present, to the northern half. 

In a similar manner we know from Falconer and Cautley's discoveries, that northern
India was formerly more closely related in its mammals to Africa than it is at the present time.
Analogous facts could be given in relation to the distribution of marine animals.

On the theory of descent with modification, the great law of the long enduring, but not immutable,
succession of the same types within the same areas, is at once explained; for the inhabitants of each
quarter of the world will obviously tend to leave in that quarter, during the next succeeding period
of time, closely allied though in some degree modified descendants. If the inhabitants of one
continent formerly differed greatly from those of another continent, so will their modified
descendants still differ in nearly the same manner and degree.

But after very long intervals of time
and after great geographical changes, permitting much inter-migration, the feebler will yield to the
more dominant forms, and there will be nothing immutable in the laws of past and present
distribution.

It may be asked in ridicule, whether I suppose that the megatherium and other allied huge monsters
have left behind them in South America the sloth, armadillo, and anteater, as their degenerate
descendants. This cannot for an instant be admitted. These huge animals have become wholly
extinct, and have left no progeny. But in the caves of Brazil, there are many extinct species which
are closely allied in size and in other characters to the species still living in South America; and
some of these fossils may be the actual progenitors of living species. 

It must not be forgotten that,
on my theory, all the species of the same genus have descended from some one species; so that if
six genera, each having eight species, be found in one geological formation, and in the next
succeeding formation there be six other allied or representative genera with the same number of
species, then we may conclude that only one species of each of the six older genera has left
modified descendants, constituting the six new genera. The other seven species of the old genera
have all died out and have left no progeny. 

Or, which would probably be a far commoner case, two
or three species of two or three alone of the six older genera will have been the parents of the six
new genera; the other old species and the other whole genera having become utterly extinct. In
failing orders, with the genera and species decreasing in numbers, as apparently is the case of the
Edentata of South America, still fewer genera and species will have left modified blood-
descendants.
