Scarcely any palaeontological discovery is more striking than the fact, that the forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout the world. 

Thus our European Chalk formation can be recognised in many distant parts of the world, under the most different climates, where not a fragment of the mineral chalk itself can be found; namely, in North America, in equatorial South America, in Tierra del Fuego, at the Cape of Good Hope, and in the peninsula of India. 

For at these distant points, the organic remains in certain beds present an unmistakeable degree of resemblance to those of the Chalk. 

It is not that the same species are met with; for in some cases not one species is identically the same, but they belong to the same families, genera, and sections of genera, and sometimes are similarly characterised in such trifling points as mere superficial sculpture. 

Moreover other forms, which are not found in the Chalk of Europe, but which occur in the formations either above or below, are similarly absent at these distant points of the world. 

In the several successive palaeozoic formations of Russia, Western Europe and North America, a similar parallelism in the forms of life has been observed by several authors: so it is, according to Lyell, with the several European and North American tertiary deposits.

Even if the few fossil species which are common to the Old and New Worlds be kept wholly out of view, the general parallelism in the successive forms of life, in the stages of the widely separated palaeozoic and tertiary periods, would still be manifest, and the several formations could be easily correlated.


These observations, however, relate to the marine inhabitants of distant parts of the world: we have not sufficient data to judge whether the productions of the land and of fresh water change at distant points in the same parallel manner.

We may doubt whether they have thus changed: if the Megatherium, Mylodon, Macrauchenia, and Toxodon had been brought to Europe from La Plata, without any information in regard to their geological position, no one would have suspected that they had coexisted with still living sea-shells; but as these anomalous monsters coexisted with the Mastodon and Horse, it might at least have been inferred that they had lived during one of the latter tertiary stages.

When the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed simultaneously throughout the world, it must not be supposed that this expression relates to the same thousandth or hundred-thousandth year, or even that it has a very strict geological sense; for if all the marine animals which live at the present day in Europe, and all those that lived in Europe during the pleistocene
period (an enormously remote period as measured by years, including the whole glacial epoch),
were to be compared with those now living in South America or in Australia, the most skilful
naturalist would hardly be able to say whether the existing or the pleistocene inhabitants of Europe
resembled most closely those of the southern hemisphere. So, again, several highly competent
observers believe that the existing productions of the United States are more closely related to those
which lived in Europe during certain later tertiary stages, than to those which now live here; and if
this be so, it is evident that fossiliferous beds deposited at the present day on the shores of NorthAmerica would hereafter be liable to be classed with somewhat older European beds. Nevertheless,
looking to a remotely future epoch, there can, I think, be little doubt that all the more modern
marine formations, namely, the upper pliocene, the pleistocene and strictly modern beds, of Europe,
North and South America, and Australia, from containing fossil remains in some degree allied, and
from not including those forms which are only found in the older underlying deposits, would be
correctly ranked as simultaneous in a geological sense.

The fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously, in the above large sense, at distant parts of
the world, has greatly struck those admirable observers, MM. de Verneuil and d'Archiac. After
referring to the parallelism of the palaeozoic forms of life in various parts of Europe, they add, 'If
struck by this strange sequence, we turn our attention to North America, and there discover a series
of analogous phenomena, it will appear certain that all these modifications of species, their
extinction, and the introduction of new ones, cannot be owing to mere changes in marine currents
or other causes more or less local and temporary, but depend on general laws which govern the
whole animal kingdom.' M. Barrande has made forcible remarks to precisely the same effect. It is,
indeed, quite futile to look to changes of currents, climate, or other physical conditions, as the cause
of these great mutations in the forms of life throughout the world, under the most different climates.
We must, as Barrande has remarked, look to some special law. We shall see this more clearly
when we treat of the present distribution of organic beings, and find how slight is the relation
between the physical conditions of various countries, and the nature of their inhabitants.
This great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life throughout the world, is explicable on
the theory of natural selection. New species are formed by new varieties arising, which have some
advantage over older forms; and those forms, which are already dominant, or have some advantage
over the other forms in their own country, would naturally oftenest give rise to new varieties or
incipient species; for these latter must be victorious in a still higher degree in order to be preserved
and to survive. We have distinct evidence on this head, in the plants which are dominant, that is,
which are commonest in their own homes, and are most widely diffused, having produced the
greatest number of new varieties. It is also natural that the dominant, varying, and far-spreading
species, which already have invaded to a certain extent the territories of other species, should be
those which would have the best chance of spreading still further, and of giving rise in new
countries to new varieties and species. The process of diffusion may often be very slow, being
dependent on climatal and geographical changes, or on strange accidents, but in the long run the
dominant forms will generally succeed in spreading. The diffusion would, it is probable, be slower
with the terrestrial inhabitants of distinct continents than with the marine inhabitants of the
continuous sea. We might therefore expect to find, as we apparently do find, a less strict degree of
parallel succession in the productions of the land than of the sea.

Dominant species spreading from any region might encounter still more dominant species, and then
their triumphant course, or even their existence, would cease. We know not at all precisely what
are all the conditions most favourable for the multiplication of new and dominant species; but we
can, I think, clearly see that a number of individuals, from giving a better chance of the appearance
of favourable variations, and that severe competition with many already existing forms, would be
highly favourable, as would be the power of spreading into new territories. A certain amount of
isolation, recurring at long intervals of time, would probably be also favourable, as before
explained. One quarter of the world may have been most favourable for the production of new and
dominant species on the land, and another for those in the waters of the sea. If two great regionshad been for a long period favourably circumstanced in an equal degree, whenever their inhabitants
met, the battle would be prolonged and severe; and some from one birthplace and some from the
other might be victorious. But in the course of time, the forms dominant in the highest degree,
wherever produced, would tend everywhere to prevail. As they prevailed, they would cause the
extinction of other and inferior forms; and as these inferior forms would be allied in groups by
inheritance, whole groups would tend slowly to disappear; though here and there a single member
might long be enabled to survive.

Thus, as it seems to me, the parallel, and, taken in a large sense, simultaneous, succession of the
same forms of life throughout the world, accords well with the principle of new species having
been formed by dominant species spreading widely and varying; the new species thus produced
being themselves dominant owing to inheritance, and to having already had some advantage over
their parents or over other species; these again spreading, varying, and producing new species. The
forms which are beaten and which yield their places to the new and victorious forms, will generally
be allied in groups, from inheriting some inferiority in common; and therefore as new and
improved groups spread throughout the world, old groups will disappear from the world; and the
succession of forms in both ways will everywhere tend to correspond.

There is one other remark connected with this subject worth making. I have given my reasons for
believing that all our greater fossiliferous formations were deposited during periods of subsidence;
and that blank intervals of vast duration occurred during the periods when the bed of the sea was
either stationary or rising, and likewise when sediment was not thrown down quickly enough to
embed and preserve organic remains. During these long and blank intervals I suppose that the
inhabitants of each region underwent a considerable amount of modification and extinction, and
that there was much migration from other parts of the world. As we have reason to believe that
large areas are affected by the same movement, it is probable that strictly contemporaneous
formations have often been accumulated over very wide spaces in the same quarter of the world;
but we are far from having any right to conclude that this has invariably been the case, and that
large areas have invariably been affected by the same movements. When two formations have been
deposited in two regions during nearly, but not exactly the same period, we should find in both,
from the causes explained in the foregoing paragraphs, the same general succession in the forms of
life; but the species would not exactly correspond; for there will have been a little more time in the
one region than in the other for modification, extinction, and immigration.

I suspect that cases of this nature have occurred in Europe. Mr. Prestwich, in his admirable
Memoirs on the eocene deposits of England and France, is able to draw a close general parallelism
between the successive stages in the two countries; but when he compares certain stages in England
with those in France, although he finds in both a curious accordance in the numbers of the species
belonging to the same genera, yet the species themselves differ in a manner very difficult to
account for, considering the proximity of the two areas,--unless, indeed, it be assumed that an
isthmus separated two seas inhabited by distinct, but contemporaneous, faunas. Lyell has made
similar observations on some of the later tertiary formations. Barrande, also, shows that there is a
striking general parallelism in the successive Silurian deposits of Bohemia and Scandinavia;
nevertheless he finds a surprising amount of difference in the species. If the several formations in
these regions have not been deposited during the same exact periods,--a formation in one region
often corresponding with a blank interval in the other,--and if in both regions the species have gone
on slowly changing during the accumulation of the several formations and during the long intervalsof time between them; in this case, the several formations in the two regions could be arranged in the same order, in accordance with the general succession of the form of life, and the order would falsely appear to be strictly parallel; nevertheless the species would not all be the same in the apparently corresponding stages in the two regions.
