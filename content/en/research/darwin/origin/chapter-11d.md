The identity of many plants and animals, on mountain-summits, separated from each other by hundreds of miles of lowlands, where the Alpine species could not possibly exist, is one of the most striking cases known of the same species living at
distant points, without the apparent possibility of their having migrated from one to the other. 

It is a remarkable fact to see so many of the same plants living on the snowy regions of the Alps
or Pyrenees, and in the extreme northern parts of Europe; but it is far more remarkable, that the
plants on the White Mountains, in the United States of America, are all the same with those of
Labrador, and nearly all the same, as we hear from Asa Gray, with those on the loftiest mountains
of Europe. 

Even as long ago as 1747, such facts led Gmelin to conclude that the same species must have been independently created at several distinct points; and we might have remained in this same belief, had not Agassiz and others called vivid attention to the Glacial period, which, as we shall immediately see, affords a simple explanation of these facts. We have evidence of almost
every conceivable kind, organic and inorganic, that within a very recent geological period, central
Europe and North America suffered under an Arctic climate. The ruins of a house burnt by fire do
not tell their tale more plainly, than do the mountains of Scotland and Wales, with their scored
flanks, polished surfaces, and perched boulders, of the icy streams with which their valleys were
lately filled. So greatly has the climate of Europe changed, that in Northern Italy, gigantic
moraines, left by old glaciers, are now clothed by the vine and maize. Throughout a large part of
the United States, erratic boulders, and rocks scored by drifted icebergs and coast-ice, plainly
reveal a former cold period.

The former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of the inhabitants of Europe, as
explained with remarkable clearness by Edward Forbes, is substantially as follows. But we shall
follow the changes more readily, by supposing a new glacial period to come slowly on, and then
pass away, as formerly occurred. As the cold came on, and as each more southern zone became
fitted for arctic beings and ill-fitted for their former more temperate inhabitants, the latter would be
supplanted and arctic productions would take their places. The inhabitants of the more temperate
regions would at the same time travel southward, unless they were stopped by barriers, in which
case they would perish. The mountains would become covered with snow and ice, and their former
Alpine inhabitants would descend to the plains. By the time that the cold had reached its
maximum, we should have a uniform arctic fauna and flora, covering the central parts of Europe, as
far south as the Alps and Pyrenees, and even stretching into Spain. The now temperate regions of
the United States would likewise be covered by arctic plants and animals, and these would be
nearly the same with those of Europe; for the present circumpolar inhabitants, which we suppose to
have everywhere travelled southward, are remarkably uniform round the world. We may suppose
that the Glacial period came on a little earlier or later in North America than in Europe, so will the
southern migration there have been a little earlier or later; but this will make no difference in the
final result.

As the warmth returned, the arctic forms would retreat northward, closely followed up in their
retreat by the productions of the more temperate regions. And as the snow melted from the basesof the mountains, the arctic forms would seize on the cleared and thawed ground, always ascending
higher and higher, as the warmth increased, whilst their brethren were pursuing their northern
journey. Hence, when the warmth had fully returned, the same arctic species, which had lately
lived in a body together on the lowlands of the Old and New Worlds, would be left isolated on
distant mountain-summits (having been exterminated on all lesser heights) and in the arctic regions
of both hemispheres.

Thus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so immensely remote as on the
mountains of the United States and of Europe. We can thus also understand the fact that the Alpine
plants of each mountain-range are more especially related to the arctic forms living due north or
nearly due north of them: for the migration as the cold came on, and the re-migration on the
returning warmth, will generally have been due south and north. The Alpine plants, for example, of
Scotland, as remarked by Mr. H. C. Watson, and those of the Pyrenees, as remarked by Ramond,
are more especially allied to the plants of northern Scandinavia; those of the United States to
Labrador; those of the mountains of Siberia to the arctic regions of that country. These views,
grounded as they are on the perfectly well-ascertained occurrence of a former Glacial period, seem
to me to explain in so satisfactory a manner the present distribution of the Alpine and Arctic
productions of Europe and America, that when in other regions we find the same species on distant
mountain-summits, we may almost conclude without other evidence, that a colder climate
permitted their former migration across the low intervening tracts, since become too warm for their
existence.

If the climate, since the Glacial period, has ever been in any degree warmer than at present (as
some geologists in the United States believe to have been the case, chiefly from the distribution of
the fossil Gnathodon), then the arctic and temperate productions will at a very late period have
marched a little further north, and subsequently have retreated to their present homes; but I have
met with no satisfactory evidence with respect to this intercalated slightly warmer period, since the
Glacial period.
The arctic forms, during their long southern migration and re-migration northward, will have been
exposed to nearly the same climate, and, as is especially to be noticed, they will have kept in a body
together; consequently their mutual relations will not have been much disturbed, and, in accordance
with the principles inculcated in this volume, they will not have been liable to much modification.
But with our Alpine productions, left isolated from the moment of the returning warmth, first at the
bases and ultimately on the summits of the mountains, the case will have been somewhat different;
for it is not likely that all the same arctic species will have been left on mountain ranges distant
from each other, and have survived there ever since; they will, also, in all probability have become
mingled with ancient Alpine species, which must have existed on the mountains before the
commencement of the Glacial epoch, and which during its coldest period will have been
temporarily driven down to the plains; they will, also, have been exposed to somewhat different
climatal influences. Their mutual relations will thus have been in some degree disturbed;
consequently they will have been liable to modification; and this we find has been the case; for if
we compare the present Alpine plants and animals of the several great European mountain-ranges,
though very many of the species are identically the same, some present varieties, some are ranked
as doubtful forms, and some few are distinct yet closely allied or representative species.In illustrating what, as I believe, actually took place during the Glacial period, I assumed that at its
commencement the arctic productions were as uniform round the polar regions as they are at the
present day. But the foregoing remarks on distribution apply not only to strictly arctic forms, but
also to many sub-arctic and to some few northern temperate forms, for some of these are the same
on the lower mountains and on the plains of North America and Europe; and it may be reasonably
asked how I account for the necessary degree of uniformity of the sub-arctic and northern
temperate forms round the world, at the commencement of the Glacial period. At the present day,
the sub-arctic and northern temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds are separated from
each other by the Atlantic Ocean and by the extreme northern part of the Pacific. During the
Glacial period, when the inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds lived further southwards than at
present, they must have been still more completely separated by wider spaces of ocean. I believe
the above difficulty may be surmounted by looking to still earlier changes of climate of an opposite
nature. We have good reason to believe that during the newer Pliocene period, before the Glacial
epoch, and whilst the majority of the inhabitants of the world were specifically the same as now,
the climate was warmer than at the present day. Hence we may suppose that the organisms now
living under the climate of latitude 60 deg, during the Pliocene period lived further north under the
Polar Circle, in latitude 66 deg-67 deg; and that the strictly arctic productions then lived on the
broken land still nearer to the pole. Now if we look at a globe, we shall see that under the Polar
Circle there is almost continuous land from western Europe, through Siberia, to eastern America.
And to this continuity of the circumpolar land, and to the consequent freedom for intermigration
under a more favourable climate, I attribute the necessary amount of uniformity in the sub-arctic
and northern temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds, at a period anterior to the Glacial
epoch.
