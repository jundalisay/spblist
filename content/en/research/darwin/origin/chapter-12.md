As lakes and river-systems are separated from each other by barriers of land, it might have been
thought that fresh-water productions would not have ranged widely within the same country, and as
the sea is apparently a still more impassable barrier, that they never would have extended to distant
countries. But the case is exactly the reverse. Not only have many fresh-water species, belonging
to quite different classes, an enormous range, but allied species prevail in a remarkable manner
throughout the world. I well remember, when first collecting in the fresh waters of Brazil, feeling
much surprise at the similarity of the fresh-water insects, shells, &c., and at the dissimilarity of the
surrounding terrestrial beings, compared with those of Britain.

But this power in fresh-water productions of ranging widely, though so unexpected, can, I think, in
most cases be explained by their having become fitted, in a manner highly useful to them, for short
and frequent migrations from pond to pond, or from stream to stream; and liability to wide
dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost necessary consequence. 

We can here consider only a few cases. In regard to fish, I believe that the same species never occur in the fresh
waters of distant continents. But on the same continent the species often range widely and almost
capriciously; for two river-systems will have some fish in common and some different. A few facts
seem to favour the possibility of their occasional transport by accidental means; like that of the live
fish not rarely dropped by whirlwinds in India, and the vitality of their ova when removed from the
water. But I am inclined to attribute the dispersal of fresh-water fish mainly to slight changes
within the recent period in the level of the land, having caused rivers to flow into each other.
Instances, also, could be given of this having occurred during floods, without any change of level.
We have evidence in the loess of the Rhine of considerable changes of level in the land within a
very recent geological period, and when the surface was peopled by existing land and fresh-water
shells. 

The wide difference of the fish on opposite sides of continuous mountain-ranges, which
from an early period must have parted river-systems and completely prevented their inosculation,
seems to lead to this same conclusion. With respect to allied fresh-water fish occurring at very
distant points of the world, no doubt there are many cases which cannot at present be explained:
but some fresh-water fish belong to very ancient forms, and in such cases there will have been
ample time for great geographical changes, and consequently time and means for much migration.
In the second place, salt-water fish can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh water; and,
according to Valenciennes, there is hardly a single group of fishes confined exclusively to fresh
water, so that we may imagine that a marine member of a fresh-water group might travel far along
the shores of the sea, and subsequently become modified and adapted to the fresh waters of a
distant land.

Some species of fresh-water shells have a very wide range, and allied species, which, on my theory, are descended from a common parent and must have proceeded from a single source, prevail throughout the world. Their distribution at first perplexed me much, as their ova are not likely to be transported by birds, and they are immediately killed by sea water, as are the adults. I could not even understand how some naturalised species have rapidly spread throughout the same country. But two facts, which I have observed--and no doubt many others remain to be observed--throwsome light on this subject. When a duck suddenly emerges from a pond covered with duck-weed, I have twice seen these little plants adhering to its back; and it has happened to me, in removing a little duck-weed from one aquarium to another, that I have quite unintentionally stocked the one with fresh-water shells from the other. But another agency is perhaps more effectual: I suspended a duck's feet, which might represent those of a bird sleeping in a natural pond, in an aquarium, where many ova of fresh-water shells were hatching; and I found that numbers of the extremely minute and just hatched shells crawled on the feet, and clung to them so firmly that when taken out of the water they could not be jarred off, though at a somewhat more advanced age they would voluntarily drop off. These just hatched molluscs, though aquatic in their nature, survived on the duck's feet, in damp air, from twelve to twenty hours; and in this length of time a duck or heron might fly at least six or seven hundred miles, and would be sure to alight on a pool or rivulet, if blown across sea to an oceanic island or to any other distant point. Sir Charles Lyell also informs me that a Dyticus has been caught with an Ancylus (a fresh-water shell like a limpet) firmly adhering to it; and a water-beetle of the same family, a Colymbetes, once flew on board the 'Beagle,' when forty-five miles distant from the nearest land: how much farther it might have flown with a favouring gale no one can tell.

With respect to plants, it has long been known what enormous ranges many fresh-water and even marsh-species have, both over continents and to the most remote oceanic islands. 

This is strikingly shown, as remarked by Alph. de Candolle, in large groups of terrestrial plants, which have only a very few aquatic members; for these latter seem immediately to acquire, as if in consequence, a very wide range. I think favourable means of dispersal explain this fact. I have before mentioned that earth occasionally, though rarely, adheres in some quantity to the feet and beaks of birds. Wading birds, which frequent the muddy edges of ponds, if suddenly flushed, would be the most likely to have muddy feet. 

Birds of this order I can show are the greatest wanderers, and are occasionally found on the most remote and barren islands in the open ocean; they would not be likely to alight on the surface of the sea, so that the dirt would not be washed off their feet; when making land, they would be sure to fly to their natural fresh-water haunts. I do not believe that botanists are aware how charged the mud of ponds is with seeds: I have tried several little experiments, but will here give only the most striking case: I took in February three table- spoonfuls of mud from three different points, beneath water, on the edge of a little pond; this mud when dry weighed only 6 3/4 ounces; I kept it covered up in my study for six months, pulling up and counting each plant as it grew; the plants were of many kinds, and were altogether 537 in number; and yet the viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup! Considering these facts, I think it would be an inexplicable circumstance if water-birds did not transport the seeds of fresh- water plants to vast distances, and if consequently the range of these plants was not very great. The same agency may have come into play with the eggs of some of the smaller fresh-water animals. Other and unknown agencies probably have also played a part. 

Fresh-water fish eat some kinds of seeds, though they reject many other kinds after having swallowed them.

Small fish swallow seeds of moderate size, as of the yellow water-lily and Potamogeton. 

Herons and other birds, century after century, have gone on daily devouring fish. They then take flight and go to other waters, or are blown across the sea.

Seeds retain their power of germination, when rejected in pellets or in excrement, many hours afterwards. 

When I saw the great size of the seeds of that fine water-lily, the Nelumbium, and remembered Alph. de Candolle's remarks on this plant, I thought that its distribution must remain quite inexplicable.

But Audubon states that he found the seeds of the great southern water-lily (probably, according to Dr. Hooker,the Nelumbium luteum) in a heron's stomach; although I do not know the fact, yet analogy makes me believe that a heron flying to another pond and getting a hearty meal of fish, would probably reject from its stomach a pellet containing the seeds of the Nelumbium undigested; or the seeds might be dropped by the bird whilst feeding its young, in the same way as fish are known sometimes to be dropped.

In considering these several means of distribution, it should be remembered that when a pond or stream is first formed, for instance, on a rising islet, it will be unoccupied; and a single seed or egg will have a good chance of succeeding. Although there will always be a struggle for life between the individuals of the species, however few, already occupying any pond, yet as the number of kinds is small, compared with those on the land, the competition will probably be less severe between aquatic than between terrestrial species; consequently an intruder from the waters of a foreign country, would have a better chance of seizing on a place, than in the case of terrestrial colonists.

Many fresh-water productions are low in the scale of nature.

Such low beings change or become modified less quickly than the high; and this will give longer time than the average for the migration of the same aquatic species.

We should not forget the probability of many species having formerly ranged as continuously as fresh-water productions ever can range, over immense areas, and having subsequently become extinct in intermediate regions. 

But the wide distribution of fresh-water plants and of the lower animals, whether retaining the same identical form or in some degree modified, I believe mainly depends on the wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals, more especially by fresh-water birds, which have large powers of flight, and naturally travel from one to another and often distant piece of water. Nature, like a careful gardener, thus takes her seeds from a bed of a particular nature, and drops them in another equally well fitted for them.
