Let us now see whether the several facts and rules relating to the geological succession of organic
beings, better accord with the common view of the immutability of species, or with that of their
slow and gradual modification, through descent and natural selection.

New species have appeared very slowly, one after another, both on the land and in the waters.
Lyell has shown that it is hardly possible to resist the evidence on this head in the case of the
several tertiary stages; and every year tends to fill up the blanks between them, and to make the
percentage system of lost and new forms more gradual. In some of the most recent beds, though
undoubtedly of high antiquity if measured by years, only one or two species are lost forms, and
only one or two are new forms, having here appeared for the first time, either locally, or, as far as
we know, on the face of the earth. If we may trust the observations of Philippi in Sicily, the
successive changes in the marine inhabitants of that island have been many and most gradual. 

The
secondary formations are more broken; but, as Bronn has remarked, neither the appearance nor
disappearance of their many now extinct species has been simultaneous in each separate formation.
Species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate, or in the same degree. In
the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct
forms. Falconer has given a striking instance of a similar fact, in an existing crocodile associated
with many strange and lost mammals and reptiles in the sub-Himalayan deposits. The Silurian
Lingula differs but little from the living species of this genus; whereas most of the other Silurian
Molluscs and all the Crustaceans have changed greatly. 

The productions of the land seem tochange at a quicker rate than those of the sea, of which a striking instance has lately been observed in Switzerland. There is some reason to believe that organisms, considered high in the scale of
nature, change more quickly than those that are low: though there are exceptions to this rule. The
amount of organic change, as Pictet has remarked, does not strictly correspond with the succession
of our geological formations; so that between each two consecutive formations, the forms of life
have seldom changed in exactly the same degree. Yet if we compare any but the most closely
related formations, all the species will be found to have undergone some change. When a species
has once disappeared from the face of the earth, we have reason to believe that the same identical
form never reappears. The strongest apparent exception to this latter rule, is that of the so-called
'colonies' of M. Barrande, which intrude for a period in the midst of an older formation, and then
allow the pre-existing fauna to reappear; but Lyell's explanation, namely, that it is a case of
temporary migration from a distinct geographical province, seems to me satisfactory.

These several facts accord well with my theory. I believe in no fixed law of development, causing
all the inhabitants of a country to change abruptly, or simultaneously, or to an equal degree. The
process of modification must be extremely slow. The variability of each species is quite
independent of that of all others. Whether such variability be taken advantage of by natural
selection, and whether the variations be accumulated to a greater or lesser amount, thus causing a
greater or lesser amount of modification in the varying species, depends on many complex
contingencies,--on the variability being of a beneficial nature, on the power of intercrossing, on the
rate of breeding, on the slowly changing physical conditions of the country, and more especially on
the nature of the other inhabitants with which the varying species comes into competition.

Hence it
is by no means surprising that one species should retain the same identical form much longer than
others; or, if changing, that it should change less. We see the same fact in geographical
distribution; for instance, in the land-shells and coleopterous insects of Madeira having come to
differ considerably from their nearest allies on the continent of Europe, whereas the marine shells
and birds have remained unaltered. We can perhaps understand the apparently quicker rate of
change in terrestrial and in more highly organised productions compared with marine and lower
productions, by the more complex relations of the higher beings to their organic and inorganic
conditions of life, as explained in a former chapter. When many of the inhabitants of a country
have become modified and improved, we can understand, on the principle of competition, and on
that of the many all-important relations of organism to organism, that any form which does not
become in some degree modified and improved, will be liable to be exterminated. Hence we can
see why all the species in the same region do at last, if we look to wide enough intervals of time,
become modified; for those which do not change will become extinct.

In members of the same class the average amount of change, during long and equal periods of time,
may, perhaps, be nearly the same; but as the accumulation of long-enduring fossiliferous
formations depends on great masses of sediment having been deposited on areas whilst subsiding,
our formations have been almost necessarily accumulated at wide and irregularly intermittent
intervals; consequently the amount of organic change exhibited by the fossils embedded in
consecutive formations is not equal. Each formation, on this view, does not mark a new and
complete act of creation, but only an occasional scene, taken almost at hazard, in a slowly changing
drama.

We can clearly understand why a species when once lost should never reappear, even if the very
same conditions of life, organic and inorganic, should recur. For though the offspring of onespecies might be adapted (and no doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances) to fill the exact
place of another species in the economy of nature, and thus supplant it; yet the two forms--the old
and the new--would not be identically the same; for both would almost certainly inherit different
characters from their distinct progenitors. For instance, it is just possible, if our fantail-pigeons
were all destroyed, that fanciers, by striving during long ages for the same object, might make a
new breed hardly distinguishable from our present fantail; but if the parent rock-pigeon were also
destroyed, and in nature we have every reason to believe that the parent-form will generally be
supplanted and exterminated by its improved offspring, it is quite incredible that a fantail, identical
with the existing breed, could be raised from any other species of pigeon, or even from the other
well-established races of the domestic pigeon, for the newly-formed fantail would be almost sure to
inherit from its new progenitor some slight characteristic differences.

Groups of species, that is, genera and families, follow the same general rules in their appearance
and disappearance as do single species, changing more or less quickly, and in a greater or lesser
degree. A group does not reappear after it has once disappeared; or its existence, as long as it lasts,
is continuous. I am aware that there are some apparent exceptions to this rule, but the exceptions
are surprisingly few, so few, that E. Forbes, Pictet, and Woodward (though all strongly opposed to
such views as I maintain) admit its truth; and the rule strictly accords with my theory.

For as all the
species of the same group have descended from some one species, it is clear that as long as any
species of the group have appeared in the long succession of ages, so long must its members have
continuously existed, in order to have generated either new and modified or the same old and
unmodified forms. Species of the genus Lingula, for instance, must have continuously existed by
an unbroken succession of generations, from the lowest Silurian stratum to the present day.
We have seen in the last chapter that the species of a group sometimes falsely appear to have come
in abruptly; and I have attempted to give an explanation of this fact, which if true would have been
fatal to my views. But such cases are certainly exceptional; the general rule being a gradual
increase in number, till the group reaches its maximum, and then, sooner or later, it gradually
decreases. If the number of the species of a genus, or the number of the genera of a family, be
represented by a vertical line of varying thickness, crossing the successive geological formations in
which the species are found, the line will sometimes falsely appear to begin at its lower end, not in
a sharp point, but abruptly; it then gradually thickens upwards, sometimes keeping for a space of
equal thickness, and ultimately thins out in the upper beds, marking the decrease and final
extinction of the species. This gradual increase in number of the species of a group is strictly
conformable with my theory; as the species of the same genus, and the genera of the same family,
can increase only slowly and progressively; for the process of modification and the production of a
number of allied forms must be slow and gradual,--one species giving rise first to two or three
varieties, these being slowly converted into species, which in their turn produce by equally slow
steps other species, and so on, like the branching of a great tree from a single stem, till the group
becomes large.
