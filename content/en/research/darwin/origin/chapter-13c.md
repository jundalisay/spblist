Descent has universally been used:
- in classing together the individuals of the same species, though the males and females and larvae are sometimes extremely different.
- in classing varieties which have undergone a certain, and sometimes a considerable amount of modification, may not this same element of descent have been unconsciously used in grouping species under genera, and genera under higher groups, though in these cases the modification has been greater in degree, and has taken a longer time to complete? I believe it has thus been
unconsciously used; 

Only thus can I understand the several rules and guides which have been
followed by our best systematists. 

We have no written pedigrees; we have to make out community of descent by resemblances of any kind. Therefore we choose those characters which, as far as we can judge, are the least likely to have been modified in relation to the conditions of life to which each species has been recently exposed. Rudimentary structures on this view are as good as, oreven sometimes better than, other parts of the organisation. We care not how trifling a character may be--let it be the mere inflection of the angle of the jaw, the manner in which an insect's wing is folded, whether the skin be covered by hair or feathers--if it prevail throughout many and different species, especially those having very different habits of life, it assumes high value; for we can account for its presence in so many forms with such different habits, only by its inheritance from a common parent. We may err in this respect in regard to single points of structure, but when several characters, let them be ever so trifling, occur together throughout a large group of beings having different habits, we may feel almost sure, on the theory of descent, that these characters have been inherited from a common ancestor. And we know that such correlated or aggregated characters
have especial value in classification.


We can understand why a species or a group of species may depart, in several of its most important
characteristics, from its allies, and yet be safely classed with them. This may be safely done, and is
often done, as long as a sufficient number of characters, let them be ever so unimportant, betrays
the hidden bond of community of descent. Let two forms have not a single character in common,
yet if these extreme forms are connected together by a chain of intermediate groups, we may at
once infer their community of descent, and we put them all into the same class. As we find organs
of high physiological importance--those which serve to preserve life under the most diverse
conditions of existence--are generally the most constant, we attach especial value to them; but if
these same organs, in another group or section of a group, are found to differ much, we at once
value them less in our classification. We shall hereafter, I think, clearly see why embryological
characters are of such high classificatory importance. Geographical distribution may sometimes be
brought usefully into play in classing large and widely-distributed genera, because all the species of
the same genus, inhabiting any distinct and isolated region, have in all probability descended from
the same parents.

We can understand, on these views, the very important distinction between real affinities and
analogical or adaptive resemblances. Lamarck first called attention to this distinction, and he has
been ably followed by Macleay and others. The resemblance, in the shape of the body and in the
fin-like anterior limbs, between the dugong, which is a pachydermatous animal, and the whale, and
between both these mammals and fishes, is analogical. Amongst insects there are innumerable
instances: thus Linnaeus, misled by external appearances, actually classed an homopterous insect
as a moth. We see something of the same kind even in our domestic varieties, as in the thickened
stems of the common and swedish turnip. The resemblance of the greyhound and racehorse is
hardly more fanciful than the analogies which have been drawn by some authors between very
distinct animals. On my view of characters being of real importance for classification, only in so
far as they reveal descent, we can clearly understand why analogical or adaptive character, although
of the utmost importance to the welfare of the being, are almost valueless to the systematist. For
animals, belonging to two most distinct lines of descent, may readily become adapted to similar
conditions, and thus assume a close external resemblance; but such resemblances will not reveal--
will rather tend to conceal their blood-relationship to their proper lines of descent. We can also
understand the apparent paradox, that the very same characters are analogical when one class or
order is compared with another, but give true affinities when the members of the same class or
order are compared one with another: thus the shape of the body and fin-like limbs are only
analogical when whales are compared with fishes, being adaptations in both classes for swimming
through the water; but the shape of the body and fin-like limbs serve as characters exhibiting true
affinity between the several members of the whale family; for these cetaceans agree in so manycharacters, great and small, that we cannot doubt that they have inherited their general shape of
body and structure of limbs from a common ancestor. So it is with fishes.

As members of distinct classes have often been adapted by successive slight modifications to live
under nearly similar circumstances,--to inhabit for instance the three elements of land, air, and
water,--we can perhaps understand how it is that a numerical parallelism has sometimes been
observed between the sub-groups in distinct classes. A naturalist, struck by a parallelism of this
nature in any one class, by arbitrarily raising or sinking the value of the groups in other classes (and
all our experience shows that this valuation has hitherto been arbitrary), could easily extend the
parallelism over a wide range; and thus the septenary, quinary, quaternary, and ternary
classifications have probably arisen.

As the modified descendants of dominant species, belonging to the larger genera, tend to inherit the
advantages, which made the groups to which they belong large and their parents dominant, they are
almost sure to spread widely, and to seize on more and more places in the economy of nature. The
larger and more dominant groups thus tend to go on increasing in size; and they consequently
supplant many smaller and feebler groups. Thus we can account for the fact that all organisms,
recent and extinct, are included under a few great orders, under still fewer classes, and all in one
great natural system. As showing how few the higher groups are in number, and how widely
spread they are throughout the world, the fact is striking, that the discovery of Australia has not
added a single insect belonging to a new order; and that in the vegetable kingdom, as I learn from
Dr. Hooker, it has added only two or three orders of small size.

In the chapter on geological succession I attempted to show, on the principle of each group having
generally diverged much in character during the long-continued process of modification, how it is
that the more ancient forms of life often present characters in some slight degree intermediate
between existing groups. A few old and intermediate parent-forms having occasionally transmitted
to the present day descendants but little modified, will give to us our so-called osculant or aberrant
groups. The more aberrant any form is, the greater must be the number of connecting forms which
on my theory have been exterminated and utterly lost. And we have some evidence of aberrant
forms having suffered severely from extinction, for they are generally represented by extremely
few species; and such species as do occur are generally very distinct from each other, which again
implies extinction. The genera Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, for example, would not have
been less aberrant had each been represented by a dozen species instead of by a single one; but such
richness in species, as I find after some investigation, does not commonly fall to the lot of aberrant
genera. We can, I think, account for this fact only by looking at aberrant forms as failing groups
conquered by more successful competitors, with a few members preserved by some unusual
coincidence of favourable circumstances.

Mr. Waterhouse has remarked that, when a member belonging to one group of animals exhibits an
affinity to a quite distinct group, this affinity in most cases is general and not special: thus,
according to Mr. Waterhouse, of all Rodents, the bizcacha is most nearly related to Marsupials; but
in the points in which it approaches this order, its relations are general, and not to any one
marsupial species more than to another. As the points of affinity of the bizcacha to Marsupials are
believed to be real and not merely adaptive, they are due on my theory to inheritance in common.
Therefore we must suppose either that all Rodents, including the bizcacha, branched off from some
very ancient Marsupial, which will have had a character in some degree intermediate with respectto all existing Marsupials; or that both Rodents and Marsupials branched off from a common progenitor, and that both groups have since undergone much modification in divergent directions. 

On either view we may suppose that the bizcacha has retained, by inheritance, more of the
character of its ancient progenitor than have other Rodents; and therefore it will not be specially
related to any one existing Marsupial, but indirectly to all or nearly all Marsupials, from having
partially retained the character of their common progenitor, or of an early member of the group.
On the other hand, of all Marsupials, as Mr. Waterhouse has remarked, the phascolomys resembles
most nearly, not any one species, but the general order of Rodents. In this case, however, it may be
strongly suspected that the resemblance is only analogical, owing to the phascolomys having
become adapted to habits like those of a Rodent. The elder De Candolle has made nearly similar
observations on the general nature of the affinities of distinct orders of plants.
On the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in character of the species descended
from a common parent, together with their retention by inheritance of some characters in common,
we can understand the excessively complex and radiating affinities by which all the members of the
same family or higher group are connected together. For the common parent of a whole family of
species, now broken up by extinction into distinct groups and sub-groups, will have transmitted
some of its characters, modified in various ways and degrees, to all; and the several species will
consequently be related to each other by circuitous lines of affinity of various lengths (as may be
seen in the diagram so often referred to), mounting up through many predecessors. As it is difficult
to show the blood-relationship between the numerous kindred of any ancient and noble family,
even by the aid of a genealogical tree, and almost impossible to do this without this aid, we can
understand the extraordinary difficulty which naturalists have experienced in describing, without
the aid of a diagram, the various affinities which they perceive between the many living and extinct
members of the same great natural class.
