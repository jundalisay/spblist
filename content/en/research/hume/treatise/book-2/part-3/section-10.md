I think we would be a little inattentive to run over the human mind without once considering that love of truth, which was the first source of all our inquiries.

We should:
        ◦ bestow a few reflections on curiosity
        ◦ show its origin in human nature.

It is such a peculiar an affection.
        ◦ It would have been impossible to have treated of it under any previous heading, without danger of obscurity and confusion.
 
    • Truth is of two kinds, consisting in:
        ◦ the discovery of the proportions of ideas or
        ◦ the conformity of our ideas of objects to their real existence.
    • The former species of truth, is not desired merely as truth, and that it is not the justness of our conclusions, which alone gives the pleasure.
    • These conclusions are equally just, when we discover the equality of two bodies by a pair of compasses, as when we learn it by a mathematical demonstration.
        ◦ In the one case, the proofs are demonstrative.
        ◦ In the other case, the proofs are only sensible.
        ◦ Yet the mind acquiesces with equal assurance in the one as in the other.
    • In an arithmetical operation, both the truth and the assurance are of the same nature, as in the most profound algebraic problem.
        ◦ In it, the pleasure is very inconsiderable, if it does not degenerate into pain.
        ◦ This is a proof that our satisfaction from the discovery of truth, does not proceed from its mere discovery, but only as endowed with certain qualities.
 
    • The first and most considerable circumstance needed to render truth agreeable, is the genius and capacity employed in its invention and discovery.
        ◦ What is easy and obvious is never valued.
        ◦ Even what is difficult is but little regarded if we come to know it without:
            ▪ difficulty
            ▪ any stretch of thought or judgment.
    • We love to trace the demonstrations of mathematicians.
        ◦ But we receive small entertainment from a person who barely informs us of the proportions of lines and angles, even if we have the utmost confidence in his judgment and veracity.
            ▪ In this case, it is enough to have ears to learn the truth.
    • We are never obliged to fix our attention or exert our genius.
        ◦ This is the most pleasant and agreeable of all the other exercises of the mind.
 
    • The exercise of genius is the principal source of the satisfaction we receive from the sciences.
        ◦ I doubt if it alone is sufficient to give us any considerable enjoyment.
    • The truth we discover must also be of some importance.
        ◦ It is easy to multiply algebraic problems to infinity.
        ◦ There is no end in the discovery of the proportions of conic sections.
            ▪ Few mathematicians take any pleasure in these researches.
            ▪ They turn their thoughts to what is more useful and important.
    • How does this utility and importance operate on us?
        ◦ In the search of such truths, many philosophers have:
            ▪ consumed their time
            ▪ destroyed their health
            ▪ neglected their fortune.
        ◦ These truths they have esteemed important and useful to the world.
        ◦ But it appeared from their whole conduct and behaviour, that they did not have:
            ▪ any public spirit
            ▪ any concern for mankind’s interests.
    • They would entirely lose all relish for their studies if they were convinced that their discoveries:
        ◦ were of no consequence
        ◦ had consequences entirely indifferent to them.
            ▪ This is a contradiction.
 
    • To remove this contradiction, we must consider that there are certain desires and inclinations which:
        ◦ go no farther than the imagination
        ◦ are rather the faint shadows and images of passions, than any real affections.
    • A man who surveys a city’s fortifications, considers their strength and advantages, natural or acquired.
        ◦ He observes the disposition and contrivance of the bastions, ramparts, mines, and other military works.
        ◦ He will receive a suitable pleasure and satisfaction in proportion as all these are fitted to attain their ends.
            ▪ This pleasure:
                • arises from the utility, not the form of the objects.
                • is only a sympathy with the inhabitants who benefit from the fortifications.
        ◦ Though it is possible, that he may have no kindness for them or may even hate them, as a stranger or enemy.
 
    • It may be objected that:
        ◦ such a remote sympathy is a very slight foundation for a passion
        ◦ so much industry and application, as we frequently observe in philosophers, can never be derived from so inconsiderable an original.
    • But the pleasure of study conflicts:
        ◦ chiefly in the mind’s action
        ◦ the exercise of the genius and understanding in the discovery or comprehension of any truth.
    • If the truth’s importance is needed to complete the pleasure, our enjoyment is not brought by any considerable addition.
        ◦ The truth’s importance is only needed in order to fix our attention.
    • When we are careless and inattentive, the understanding has no effect on us.
        ◦ It is unable to convey any of that satisfaction from understanding.

    • The mind’s action is the principal foundation of that pleasure.
        ◦ Besides this, we also need a degree of success in:
            ▪ the attainment of the end, or
            ▪ the discovery of that truth.
    • Where the mind pursues any end with passion, we:
        ◦ acquire a concern for the end itself
        ◦ are uneasy if we are disappointed with its pursuit.
            ▪ Even if that passion is not derived originally from the end, but merely from the action and pursuit.
            ▪ Yet by the natural course of the affections, this proceeds from the relation and parallel direction of the passions above-mentioned.

    • The passions of hunting and philosophy are two passions most nearly resembling each other.
        ◦ The pleasure of hunting conflicts in the motion, attention, difficulty, and uncertainty of actions of the mind and body.
        ◦ These actions must be attended with an idea of utility, for them to have any effect on us.
    • A man of the greatest fortune and the farthest from avarice takes a pleasure in hunting patridges and pheasants.
        ◦ He feels no satisfaction in shooting crows and magpies because he considers:
            ▪ patridges and pheasants fit for the table
            ▪ crows and magpies as useless.
    • The utility or importance of itself causes no real passion.
        ◦ It is only needed to support the imagination.
        ◦ The same person who overlooks a ten times greater profit in any other subject, is pleased to bring home six woodcocks or plovers, after having hunted them for several hours.
    • To make the parallel between hunting and philosophy more complete, we may observe that in both cases the end of our action may be despised.
        ◦ Yet in the heat of the action, we acquire such an attention to this end, that we are:
            ▪ very uneasy under any disappointments
            ▪ sorry when we:
                • miss our game or
                • fall into any error in our reasoning.

    • If we want another parallel to these affections, we may consider the passion of gaming.
        ◦ It affords a pleasure from the same principles as hunting and philosophy.
    • The pleasure of gaming does not arise from interest alone.
        ◦ Since many leave a sure gain for this entertainment.
    • It is not derived from the game alone.
        ◦ Since the same persons have no satisfaction, when they play for nothing.
    • It proceeds from both these causes united.
        ◦ Though separately, they have no effect.
    • It is here, as in certain chemical preparations, where the mixture of two clear and transparent liquids produces a third opaque and coloured liquid.
 
    • Our interest in any game engages our attention, without which we can have no enjoyment.
    • Once our attention is engaged, the difficulty, variety, and sudden reverses of fortune, further interests us.
        ◦ Our satisfaction arises from that concern.
    • Human life is so tiresome a scene.
        ◦ Men generally are of such indolent dispositions.
        ◦ Whatever amuses them gives them a sensible pleasure, though by a passion mixed with pain.
            ▪ This pleasure is increased by the nature of the objects which are sensible and of a narrow compass.
                • They are:
                    ◦ entered into with facility
                    ◦ agreeable to the imagination.
 
    • The same theory that accounts for the love of truth in mathematics and algebra may be extended to morals, politics, natural philosophy, and other studies.
        ◦ In these, we consider the real connections and existence of ideas, not their other abstract relations of ideas.
    • The love of knowledge displays itself in the sciences.
        ◦ Besides this, there is a certain curiosity implanted in human nature.
        ◦ This curiosity is a passion derived from a quite different principle.
    • Some people have an insatiable desire of knowing the actions and circumstances of their neighbours.
        ◦ Even if:
            ▪ their interest is in no way concerned in them
            ▪ they must entirely depend on others for their information.
                • In this case, there is no room for study or application.
    • Let us search for the reason of this phenomenon.

    • It has been proved at large, that the influence of belief is at once to:
        ◦ enliven and infix any idea in the imagination
        ◦ prevent all kinds of hesitation and uncertainty about it.
    • Both these circumstances are advantageous.
        ◦ By the vivacity of the idea we:
            ▪ interest the fancy
            ▪ produce the same pleasure arising from a moderate passion, in a lesser degree.
    • The vivacity of the idea gives pleasure.
        ◦ Its certainty prevents uneasiness by:
            ▪ fixing one particular idea in the mind
            ▪ keeping it from wavering in the choice of its objects.
    • The following is a conspicuous quality of human nature that is common to the mind and body.
        ◦ A change that is too sudden and violent is unpleasant to us.
        ◦ No matter how objects may be indifferent in themselves, their alteration gives uneasiness.
    • It is the nature of doubt to:
        ◦ cause a variation in the thought
        ◦ transport us suddenly from one idea to another
    • Consequently, it must bring pain.
        ◦ This pain chiefly takes place, where interest, relation, or the greatness and novelty of any event interests us.
        ◦ We do not have the interest nor curiosity to know every matter of fact.
        ◦ It is enough for the idea to strike us with such force and concern us so nearly, to give us an uneasiness in its instability and inconstancy.
    • A stranger, who first arrives at any town, may be entirely indifferent about knowing the inhabitants’ history and adventures.
        ◦ But he acquires the same curiosity as the natives, as he:
            ▪ becomes more acquainted with them
            ▪ has lived any considerable time among them.
    • When we read the history of a nation, we may have an ardent desire to clear up any doubt or difficulty that occurs in it.
        ◦ But we become careless in such researches when the ideas of these events are obliterated.
