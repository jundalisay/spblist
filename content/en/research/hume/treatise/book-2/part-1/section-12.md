The causes of pride and humility correspond exactly to our hypothesis.

Nothing can excite pride or humility unless it:
- is related to ourselves
- produces a pleasure or pain independent of the passion.

We have proven that:
- a tendency to produce pleasure or pain is common to all the causes of pride or humility
            ▪ This tendency is the only thing which is common to them.
            ▪ Consequently, it is the quality by which they operate.
        ◦ the most considerable causes of pride and humility are really the power of producing agreeable or uneasy sensations.
    • Therefore, all the effects of pride and humility are derived solely from that origin.
        ◦ Such simple and natural principles are founded on such solid proofs.
        ◦ They must be received by philosophers, unless there are objections that have escaped me.
    • Anatomists usually join their observations and experiments on human bodies to those on animals.
        ◦ From the agreement of these experiments, they derive an additional argument for any particular hypothesis.
    • Where the structure and operation of parts in brutes is the same as in men the causes of that operation cannot be different.
        ◦ Whatever we discover to be true of the one species, may be true of the other.
    • The mixture of humours and composition of minute parts may justly be presumed different in men from what it is in mere animals.
        ◦ Any experiment we make on the one on the effects of medicines will not always apply to the other.
        ◦ Yet the structure of the veins, muscles, heart, lungs, stomach, liver and other parts, are nearly the same in all animals.
            ▪ The same hypothesis which explains muscular motion, blood circulation, and digestion in one species must be applicable to every species.
            ▪ As it agrees or disagrees with the experiments we make in any species, we may draw a proof of its truth or falsehood on the whole.
    • Let us:
        ◦ apply this method of inquiry to the mind’s anatomy
        ◦ see what discoveries we can make by it.
            ▪ This inquiry is just and useful in reasonings on the body.
    • To do this, we must:
        ◦ first show the correspondence of passions in men and animals
        ◦ afterwards compare the causes which produce these passions.
    • Almost in every species of creatures, especially of the nobler kind, there are many evident marks of pride and humility.
        ◦ The very port and gait of a swan, turkey, or peacock show:
            ▪ his high idea of himself
            ▪ his contempt of all others.
        ◦ In turkeys and peacocks, it is more remarkable that the pride:
            ▪ always attends the beauty
            ▪ is discovered only in the male.
    • The following characteristics have been commonly remarked:
        ◦ the vanity and emulation of nightingales in singing
        ◦ the swiftness of horses
        ◦ the sagacity and smell of hounds
        ◦ the strength of the bull and cock
        ◦ the particular excellency of every other animal.
    • Every species of creatures which approach so often to man, as to familiarize themselves with him:
        ◦ show an evident pride in his approbation
        ◦ are pleased with his praises and caresses, independent of every other consideration.
    • They do not get this vanity from the caresses of everyone without distinction.
        ◦ They get it principally from the persons they know and love, in the same way as vanity is excited in mankind.
    • All these are evident proofs that pride and humility are not merely human passions, but extend over the whole animal creation.
    • The causes of these passions are likewise much the same in beasts as in us, making a just allowance for our superior knowledge and understanding.
    • Thus, animals:
        ◦ have little or no sense of virtue or vice
        ◦ quickly lose sight of blood relations
        ◦ are incapable of that of right and property.
    • For which reason the causes of their pride and humility:
        ◦ must lie solely in the body
        ◦ can never be placed in the mind or external objects.
    • With regards the body, the same qualities cause pride in animals as in humans.
        ◦ Pride is always founded on beauty, strength, swiftness or some other useful or agreeable quality.
    • Throughout creation, pride and humility:
        ◦ are the same
        ◦ arise from the same causes
    • Do their causes also operate in the same manner?
        ◦ According to all rules of analogy, this is justly to be expected.
    • If we find on trial, that our explanation of these phenomena in one species will not apply to other species, we may presume that that explanation has no foundation.
    • To answer this question, let us consider that there is the same relation of ideas from the same causes, in the minds of animals and men.
    • A dog that has hidden a bone, often forgets the place.
        ◦ But when brought to it, his thought passes easily to what he formerly concealed through the contiguity which produces a relation among his ideas.
        ◦ Similarly, when he has been beaten in any place, he will tremble on his approach to it, even though he discovers no signs of any present danger.
    • The effects of resemblance are not so remarkable.
        ◦ But that relation makes a considerable ingredient in causation which all animals show an obvious judgment.
        ◦ We may conclude that the three relations of resemblance, contiguity and causation operate in the same way on beasts as on humans.
    • There are also instances of the relation of impressions which are sufficient to convince us that:
        ◦ there is a union of certain affections with each other in the inferior and superior species of creatures
        ◦ their minds are frequently conveyed through a series of connected emotions.
    • A dog elevated with joy, runs naturally into love and kindness whether of his master or of the sex.
        ◦ When full of pain and sorrow, he becomes quarrelsome and ill-natured.
        ◦ His initial grief is converted into anger by the smallest occasion.
    • Thus, all the internal principles necessary in us to produce pride or humility, are common to all creatures.
        ◦ Since the causes which excite these passions are likewise the same, we may conclude that these causes operate in the same way through the whole animal creation.
    • My hypothesis is so simple.
        ◦ It supposes so little reflection and judgment.
        ◦ It is applicable to every sensible creature.
            ▪ This:
                • is a convincing proof of its veracity
                • will be an objection to every other system.
