We have observed a difference between the object of the passions and their cause.
        ◦ We distinguish in the cause the quality, which operates on the passions, from the subject, in which it inheres.
    • We now examine what:
        ◦ determines each of them to be what it is
        ◦ assigns such a particular object, quality, and subject to these affections.
    • Through this, we shall fully understand the origin of pride and humility.
    • These passions are derermined to have the self for their object through a natural and original property.
        ◦ No one can doubt but this property is natural from the constancy and steadiness of its operations.
    • The self is always the object of pride and humility.
        ◦ The passions look beyond, still with a view to ourselves.
        ◦ Otherwise, any person or object cannot have any influence on us.
    • This proceeds from an original quality or primary impulse, if we consider that it is the distinguishing characteristic of these passions.
        ◦ Unless nature had given some original qualities to the mind, it could never have any secondary qualities.
        ◦ In that case, it:
            ▪ would have no foundation for action, nor
            ▪ could ever begin to exert itself.
    • These original qualities:
        ◦ are most inseparable from the soul
        ◦ can be resolved into no other.
    • This quality determines the object of pride and humility.
    • Are the causes that produce the passion as natural as the object it is directed to?
    • Does that vast variety proceed from caprice or from the mind’s constitution?
        ◦ We shall remove this doubt if we:
            ▪ cast our eye on human nature
            ▪ consider that in all nations and ages, the same objects still give rise to pride and humility.
    • Upon the view even of a stranger, we can know what will increase or reduce his passions.
        ◦ If there is any variation in this, it only proceeds from a difference in the men’s tempers and complexions.
            ▪ It is besides very inconsiderable.
    • Can we imagine it possible for:
        ◦ men to ever become entirely indifferent to their power, riches, beauty or personal merit
        ◦ men’s pride and vanity to be unaffected by these advantages?
    • The causes of pride and humility are plainly natural, but they are not original.
        ◦ It is impossible for each of them be adapted to these passions by a:
            ▪ particular provision
            ▪ primary constitution of nature.

Beside their prodigious number, many of them:
        ◦ are the effects of art
        ◦ arise partly from the industry
            ▪ Industry produces houses, furniture, clothes.
        ◦ arise partly from the caprice
            ▪ Caprice determines their kinds and qualities.
        ◦ arise partly from the good fortune of men
            ▪ Good fortune frequently contributes to all this
            ▪ It discovers the effects that result from the different mixtures and combinations of bodies.
    • Each of these was not foreseen nor provided for by nature.
    • Every new production of art, which causes pride or humility, is itself not the object of an original principle.
        ◦ This principle did not lay concealed in the soul.
        ◦ It was not brought to light only by accident.
    • Instead, it adapts itself to pride or humility by sharing some general quality that naturally operates on the mind.
    • It is ridiculous to think that:
        ◦ a fine scritoire, created by an inventor, produced pride in the inventor
        ◦ this principle is then different from those which made him proud of handsome chairs and tables.
    • We must conclude that each cause of pride and humility is not adapted to the passions by a distinct original quality.
        ◦ Instead, there are some circumstances common to all of them, which their efficacy depends on.
    • We find in nature that though the effects be many, the principles, from which they arise, are commonly few and simple.
    • It is the sign of an unskillful naturalist to have recourse to a different quality to explain every different operation.
    • How much more must this be true with regard to the human mind?
        ◦ Such a confined a subject may justly be thought incapable of containing such a monstrous heap of principles.
        ◦ These principles would be necessary to excite pride and humility.
        ◦ Each distinct cause would then need to be adapted to pride and humility by a distinct set of principles.
    • Moral philosophy is in the same condition as natural philosophy, with regard to astronomy before Copernicus’ time.
    • The ancients knew of the maxim that nature does nothing in vain.
        ◦ They contrived intricate systems of the heavens which seemed inconsistent with true philosophy.
        ◦ They gave way to something more simple and natural in the end.
    • The following proves that:
        ◦ none of those systems is the just one
        ◦ we want to cover our ignorance of the truth by:
            ▪ a number of falsehoods
            ▪ the invention of a new principle to every new phenomenon, instead of adapting it to the old
        ◦ overloading our hypotheses with a variety of this kind.
