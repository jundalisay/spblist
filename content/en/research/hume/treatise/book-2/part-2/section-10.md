To understand all the passions which have any mixture of love or hatred, only respect, contempt, and the amorous affection remain to be explained.
 
    • When we consider the qualities and circumstances of others, we may:
        ◦ regard them as they really are in themselves
        ◦ compare them and our own qualities and circumstances, or
        ◦ join these two methods.
    • From the first point of view, the good qualities of others produce love.
        ◦ From the second point of view, humility
        ◦ From the third, respect.
            ▪ Respect is a mixture of these two passions.
    • The bad qualities of others cause hatred, pride, or contempt, according to how we view them.
 
    • There is an evident mixture of:
        ◦ pride in contempt
        ◦ humility in respect.
    • This mixture arises from a tacit comparison of the person contemned or respected with ourselves.
        ◦ The same man may cause respect, love, or contempt by his condition and talents, according to how equal or superior he is to the person who considers him.
    • In changing the point of view, the object may remain the same.
        ◦ Its proportion to ourselves entirely alters.
        ◦ This is the cause of an alteration in the passions.
    • Therefore, these passions arise from our observing the proportion; that is, from a comparison.
 
    • The mind has a much stronger propensity to pride than to humility.
    • I have endeavoured to assign a cause for this phenomenon, from the principles of human nature.
        ◦ This phenomenon:
            ▪ is undisputed
            ▪ appears in many instances
            ▪ is why:
                • there is a much greater mixture of pride in contempt, than of humility in respect.
                • we are more elevated with the view of one below us, than mortified by one above us.
    • Contempt or scorn has so strong a tincture of pride, that there is no other passion discernable.
        ◦ Whereas in esteem or respect, love makes a more considerable ingredient than humility.
    • Vanity is so prompt, that it rouses at the least call.
        ◦ Humility requires a stronger impulse to make it exert itself.
 
    • Why does this mixture happen only in some cases?
    • All those objects which cause love when placed on another person, are the causes of:
        ◦ pride when transferred to ourselves
        ◦ humility and love consequently, while they:
            ▪ belong to others
            ▪ are only compared to those which we have ourselves.
    • In a like manner, every quality which produces hatred directly, should always cause pride by comparison.
        ◦ By a mixture of hatred and pride, those qualities should excite contempt or scorn.
    • Why:
        ◦ do objects ever cause pure love or hatred
        ◦ don’t objects always produce the mixed passions of respect and contempt?
 
    • Love and pride, humility and hatred are similar in their sensations.
        ◦ Love and pride are always agreeable.
        ◦ Humility and hatred are always painful.
    • This be universally true.
        ◦ But they have some differences, and even contrarieties, which distinguish them.
    • Pride and vanity most invigorates and exalts the mind.
        ◦ Love or tenderness weakens and enfeebles it.
    • The same difference is observable between the uneasy passions.
        ◦ Anger and hatred bestow a new force on all our thoughts and actions.
        ◦ Humility and shame deject and discourage us.
    • We need to form a distinct idea of these qualities of the passions.
        ◦ Let us remember that:
            ▪ pride and hatred invigorate the soul
            ▪ love and humility enfeeble it.
 
    • It follows that the conformity between love and hatred in the agreeableness of their sensation always makes them excited by the same objects.
        ◦ Yet this other contrariety is why they are excited in very different degrees.
    • Genius and learning are pleasant and magnificent objects.
        ◦ They are adapted to pride and vanity.
        ◦ But they have a relation to love by their pleasure only.
    • Ignorance and simplicity are disagreeable and mean.
        ◦ This gives them:
            ▪ a double connection with humility
            ▪ a single connection with hatred.
    • Therefore, the same object always produces love and pride, humility and hatred, according to its different situations.
        ◦ But it seldom produces either of them in the same proportion.
 
    • We must seek a solution as to why any object:
        ◦ ever excites pure love or hatred
        ◦ does not always produce respect or contempt, by a mixture of humility or pride.
    • No quality in another gives rise to humility by comparison, unless it produced pride by being placed in ourselves.
        ◦ Vice versa, no object excites pride by comparison, unless it produced humility by the direct survey.
    • Objects always produce a sensation directly contrary to their original one, by comparison.
        ◦ Suppose an object, which produces love but imperfectly excites pride, is presented.
        ◦ This object directly causes a great degree of love since it belongs to another
            ▪ It causes a small degree of humility by comparison.
            ▪ Consequently, humility is scarce felt.
            ▪ It is unable to convert the love into respect.
    • This is the case with good nature, good humour, facility, generosity, beauty, and many other qualities in other people.
        ◦ These can produce love in others.
            ▪ But they do not excite so much pride in ourselves.
    • This is why they produce pure love with a small mix of humility and respect, when belonging to another person.
        ◦ The same reasoning can be easily extended to the opposite passions.
 
    • Before we leave this subject, it may not be amiss to account for a pretty curious phenomenon, viz, why we commonly keep the people we contemn at a distance and do not allow our inferiors to approach too near in place and situation.
    • Almost every kind of idea is attended with some emotion and fix our attention.
        ◦ For example:
            ▪ the ideas of number and extension
            ▪ important objects in life.
    • We cannot survey a rich or a poor man with total indifference.
        ◦ We must feel some faint touches of:
            ▪ respect in the rich man
            ▪ contempt in the poor man.
        ◦ These two passions are contrary to each other.
        ◦ To make this contrariety felt, the objects must be related in some way.
        ◦ Otherwise, the affections:
            ▪ are totally separate and distinct
            ▪ never encounter.
    • The relation takes place wherever the persons become contiguous.
        ◦ This is a general reason why we are uneasy at seeing such disproportioned objects, as a rich man and a poor one, a nobleman and a porter, in that situation.
 
    • This uneasiness is common to every spectator.
        ◦ It must be more sensible to the superior, because the inferior’s near approach:
            ▪ is regarded as a piece of ill-breeding
            ▪ shows that he is not:
                • sensible of the disproportion
                • affected by it.
    • A sense of superiority in another:
        ◦ breeds an inclination in all men to keep themselves at a distance from him
        ◦ determines them to redouble the marks of respect and reverence, when they are obliged to approach him.
    • and where they do not observe that conduct, it is a proof they are not sensible of his superiority.
    • From here too it proceeds, that any great difference in the degrees of any quality is called a distance by a common metaphor.
        ◦ It is, however, founded on natural principles of the imagination.
    • A great difference inclines us to produce a distance.
        ◦ Therefore, the ideas of distance and difference are connected together.
    • Connected ideas are readily taken for each other; and this is in general the source of the metaphor, as we shall have occasion to observe afterwards.
