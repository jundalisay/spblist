SEC. 3: DIFFICULTIES SOLVED

It is superfluous to examine all the causes of love and hatred after so many undeniable proofs drawn from daily experience.

    • Therefore, I shall use this part:
        1. To remove some difficulties on particular causes of these passions.
        2. To examine the compound affections arising from the mixture of love and hatred with other emotions.
    • It is most obvious that:
        ◦ anyone acquires our kindness, or is exposed to our ill-will, in proportion to the pleasure or uneasiness we receive from him
        ◦ the passions keep pace exactly with the sensations in all their changes and variations.
    • Whoever can render himself useful or agreeable to us by his services, beauty, or flattery, is sure of our affections.
        ◦ Whoever harms or displeases us always excites our anger or hatred.
    • When our own nation is at war with any other, we detest them as cruel, perfidious, unjust and violent.
        ◦ But we always esteem ourselves and our allies as equitable, moderate, and merciful.
    • If the general of our enemies is successful, we allow him the figure and character of a man, with difficulty.
        ◦ Oliver Cromwell and the Duke of Luxembourg were reported to:
            ▪ be sorcerers
            ▪ have communication with demons
            ▪ be bloody-minded
            ▪ take pleasure in death and destruction.
    • But if success is on our side, our commander:
        ◦ has all the opposite good qualities
        ◦ is an example of virtue, courage, and conduct.
    • His treachery, we call policy.
        ◦ His cruelty is an evil inseparable from war.
    • In short, we try to extenuate or dignify all of his faults as virtue.
        ◦ The same method of thinking runs through common life.
    • Some people:
        ◦ add another condition.
        ◦ require that the pain and pleasure:
            ▪ arise from the person
            ▪ arise knowingly with a particular design and intention.
    • A man, who wounds and harms us by accident, does not become our enemy.
        ◦ We do not think ourselves bound by any ties of gratitude to one who does us any service accidentally.
    • Actions become causes of love or hatred by the good or bad intention.
    • But here we must make a distinction.
    • If that quality which pleases or displeases in another is constant and inherent in his character, it will cause love or hatred, independent of the intention.
        ◦ But otherwise, a knowledge and design is needed to create these passions.
    • A person who is disagreeable by his deformity or folly is the object of our aversion.
        ◦ Even if he did not intend to displease us by these qualities.
    • But if the uneasiness does not proceed from a quality, but from an action produced and annihilated in a moment, it needs to be derived from a particular fore-thought and design, to:
        ◦ produce some relation
        ◦ connect this action with that person.
    • It is not enough:
        ◦ for the action to arise from the person
        ◦ to have him for its immediate cause and author.
    • This relation alone is too feeble and inconstant to be a foundation for these passions.
        ◦ It does not:
            ▪ reach the sensible and thinking part.
            ▪ proceed from anything durable in him
            ▪ leave anything behind it.
    • It passes in a moment as if it had never been.
        ◦ On the other hand, an intention shows qualities which remain after the action is performed.
            ▪ These qualities:
                • connect it with the person
                • facilitate the transition of ideas from one to the other.
    • We can never think of him without reflecting on these qualities, unless repentance and a change of life have produced a change in that respect.
        ◦ In this case, the passion is likewise changed.
    • This is why an intention is needed to excite love or hatred.
    • An intention strengthens the relation of ideas.
        ◦ Intention is often necessary to:
            ▪ produce a relation of impressions
            ▪ give rise to pleasure and uneasiness.
    • The principal part of an injury is the contempt and hatred on the person’s intention who injures us.
        ◦ Without that, the mere harm gives us a less sensible uneasiness.
    • Similarly, a good office is agreeable, chiefly because it flatters our vanity.
        ◦ It is a proof of the kindness and esteem of its performer.
    • The removal of the intention removes the mortification in the former case, and vanity in the latter.
        ◦ It must cause a remarkable reduction in love and hatred.
    • These effects of the removal of intention in reducing the relations of impressions and ideas, are not entire
        ◦ They are unable to remove every degree of these relations.
    • But if the removal of intention is able to remove love and hatred entirely?
        ◦ Experience tells us of the contrary.
        ◦ Men often become violently angry for involuntary and accidental injuries.
        ◦ This anger cannot last long.
        ◦ But it is sufficient to show that:
            ▪ there is a natural connection between uneasiness and anger
            ▪ the relation of impressions will operate on a very small relation of ideas.
    • But after the violence of the impression a little abated, the relation’s defect begins to be better felt.
        ◦ A person is not interested in such casual and involuntary injuries.
        ◦ We seldom entertain a lasting enmity on them.
    • This is illustrated by:
        ◦ the uneasiness proceeding from another person by accident
        ◦ the uneasiness from an acknowledged necessity and duty.
            ▪ These have little force to excite our passion.
    • A person that has a real intention of harming us from justice and equity, instead of hatred and ill-will, does not draw our anger on him, if we are reasonable.
        ◦ He is both the cause and the knowing cause of our sufferings.
        ◦ Let us examine this phenomenon.
    • In the first place, this circumstance is not decisive.
        ◦ It may be able to reduce the passions.
        ◦ It can seldom entirely remove them.
    • Few criminals have no ill-will to their accuser or to the judge that condemns them, even if they are conscious of their own deserts?
    • Our antagonist in a law-suit and our competitor for any office, are commonly regarded as our enemies, even if their motive is as justifiable as our own.
    • When we receive harm from anyone, we are apt to imagine him criminal.
        ◦ We allow of his justice and innocence with extreme difficulty.
    • This is a clear proof that, independent of the opinion of iniquity:
        ◦ any harm or uneasiness has a natural tendency to excite our hatred
        ◦ we afterwards seek for reasons to justify and establish our hatred .
    • Here, the idea of injury does not produce the passion, but arises from it.
    • It is no wonder why hatred should produce the opinion of injury.
        ◦ Since otherwise, hatred must suffer a considerable reduction, which all the passions avoid as much as possible.
    • The removal of injury may remove the anger without proving that the anger arises only from the injury.
    • The harm and the justice are two contrary objects.
        ◦ Harm produces hatred.
        ◦ Justice produces love.
    • Either of the objects prevails and excites its proper passion according to:
        ◦ their different degrees
        ◦ our particular turn of thinking.
