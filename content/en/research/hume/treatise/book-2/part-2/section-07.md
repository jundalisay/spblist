The desire of the happiness or misery of others is an arbitrary and original instinct implanted in our nature. It may:
- be counterfeited on many occasions
- arise from secondary principles.

Pity is a concern for the misery of others.

Malice is a joy in the misery of others.

In both, no friendship or enmity occasions this concern or joy.
- We pity even strangers who are perfectly indifferent to us.

If our ill-will to another proceed from any harm or injury, it is not malice, but revenge.
        ◦ Pity and malice are secondary affections arising from original ones which are varied by some turn of thought and imagination.
    • It will be easy to explain pity from the precedent reasoning on sympathy.
        ◦ We have a lively idea of everything related to us.
        ◦ All human creatures are related to us by resemblance.
        ◦ Therefore, their persons, interests, passions, pains and pleasures must:
            ▪ strike us in a lively manner
            ▪ produce an emotion similar to the original one.
                • Since a lively idea is easily converted into an impression.
    • If this is true in general, it must be more true of affliction and sorrow.
        ◦ These always have a stronger and more lasting influence than any pleasure or enjoyment.

A spectator of a tragedy passes through a long train of grief, terror, indignation, and other affections, which the poet represents in his poem’s characters.
        ◦ Many tragedies end happily.
        ◦ All excellent tragedies have some reverses of fortune.
        ◦ The spectator must:
            ▪ sympathize with all these changes
            ▪ receive the fictitious joy as well as every other passion.
    • All passions arise from that principle, unless every distinct passion:
        ◦ is communicated by a distinct original quality,
        ◦ is not derived from the general principle of sympathy above-explained.
    • It is highly unreasonable to have any passion as an exception.
        ◦ All passions first present in the mind of one person.
        ◦ Afterwards they appear in the mind of another.
        ◦ The manner of their appearance is first as an idea, then as an impression.
            ▪ This is the same in every case.
            ▪ Thus, the transition must arise from the same principle.
    • This method of reasoning would be certain in natural philosophy or common life.
    • Pity depends, in a great measure, on the contiguity and even sight of the object.
    • This is a proof that it is derived from the imagination.
    • Women and children are most guided by the imagination.
        ◦ Thus, they are most subject to pity.
        ◦ This infirmity makes them:
            ▪ faint at the sight of a naked sword, though in the hands of their best friend
            ▪ pity those they find in any grief or affliction greatly.
    • Some philosophers derive pity from some unknown reflections on:
        ◦ the instability of fortune
        ◦ our being liable to the same miseries we see.
    • They will find this easy observation, and many others, contrary to them.
    • Regarding pity, it is remarkable that the communicated sympathy:
        ◦ sometimes acquires strength from the weakness of its original sympathy
        ◦ even arises by a transition from non-existent affections.
    • When a person obtains any honourable office, or inherits a great fortune, we always are happier for his prosperity:
        ◦ the less sense he seems to have of it
        ◦ the greater equanimity and indifference he shows in its enjoyment.
    • Similarly, we more lament a man who is not dejected by misfortunes by his patience.
        ◦ Our compassion increases if his patience utterly removes all his sense of uneasiness.

When a person of merit falls into a great misfortune, we form a notion of his condition.
        ◦ We carry our fancy from the cause to the usual effect.
        ◦ We first conceive a lively idea of his sorrow.
        ◦ We then feel an impression of it.
        ◦ His mind’s greatness which elevates him above such emotions.
            ▪ We:
                • entirely overlook this, or
                • only consider it to increase our admiration, love and tenderness for him.
    • We find from experience that such a degree of passion is usually connected with such a misfortune.
        ◦ Though this is an exception in the present case, the imagination is affected by the general rule.
            ▪ It makes us:
                • conceive a lively idea of the passion, or
                • rather feel the passion itself in the same way as if the person were really actuated by it.
    • This is why we blush for people who behave foolishly before us, though they:
        ◦ show no sense of shame
        ◦ do not seem conscious of their folly.
    • All this proceeds from a partial kind of sympathy.
        ◦ It views its objects only on one side, without considering the other, which has a contrary effect, and would entirely destroy that emotion from the first appearance.
    • There are instances when an indifference and insensibility under misfortune increases our concern for the unfortunate, even if the indifference does not proceed from virtue and magnanimity.
    • Persons killed in their sleep is aggravated murder.
        ◦ Historians observe that any infant prince, killed in this way by his enemies, is worthier of compassion the less sensible he is of his miserable condition.
    • Here, we are acquainted with the person’s wretched situation.
        ◦ It gives us a lively idea and sensation of sorrow attending it.
        ◦ This idea becomes more lively.
        ◦ The sensation becomes more violent by a contrast with that security and indifference, which we observe in the person himself.
    • A contrast of any kind never fails to affect the imagination, especially when:
        ◦ presented by the subject
        ◦ that pity depends entirely on the imagination.

Footnote 11.
    • To prevent all ambiguity, when I oppose the imagination to the memory, I generally mean the imagination that presents our fainter ideas.
    • In all other places, particularly when it is opposed to the understanding, the same imagination only excludes our demonstrative and probable reasonings.
