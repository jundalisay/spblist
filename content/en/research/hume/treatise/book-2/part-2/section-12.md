Love and hatred are common to the whole sensitive creation.
        ◦ Their causes have such a simple nature that they can easily be supposed to operate on animals.
    • There is no force of reflection or penetration required.
    • Everything is conducted by springs and principles, which are not peculiar to man or any one species of animals.
    • The conclusion from this is obvious in favour of the foregoing system.
 
Love in animals comprehends almost every sensible and thinking being.
    • A dog naturally:
        ◦ loves a man above his own species
        ◦ very commonly meets with a return of affection.
 

Animals are little susceptible of the imagination’s pleasures or pains, they can judge objects only by the sensible good or evil the objects produce.
        ◦ From that, animals must regulate their affections towards them.
    • By benefits or injuries we produce their love or hatred.
    • By feeding and cherishing any animal, we quickly acquire his affections.
    • By beating and abusing him, we always draw his enmity and ill-will.
 
    • Love in beasts is not caused so much by relation, as in our species.
        ◦ Because their thoughts are not so active as to trace relations, except in very obvious instances.
    • Yet sometimes, love has a considerable influence on them.
    • Acquaintance has the same effect as relation.
        ◦ Thus, it always produces love in animals to men or to other animals.
        ◦ For the same reason, any likeness among them is the source of affection.
            ▪ An ox, confined to a park with horses, will naturally join their company.
            ▪ But he will always enjoy the company of his own species if he has the choice of both.

    • The affection of parents to their young proceeds from a peculiar instinct in animals, as well as in our species.

    • Sympathy, or the communication of passions, takes place among animals, no less than among men.
    • Fear, anger, courage, and other affections are frequently communicated from one animal to another, without them knowing the cause which produced the original passion.
    • Grief likewise:
        ◦ is received by sympathy
        ◦ produces almost all the same consequences
        ◦ excites the same emotions as in our species.
    • A dog’s howlings and lamentations produce a sensible concern in his fellows.
    • Almost all animals use the same body parts in playing and in fighting:
        ◦ lions, tigers, and cats use their paws
        ◦ oxen use their horns
        ◦ dogs use their teeth
        ◦ horses use their heels
    • It is remarkable that they most carefully avoid harming their companion, even though they have nothing to fear from his resentment.
        ◦ This is an evident proof of the sense which animals have of each other’s pain and pleasure.
 
    • Everyone has observed how much more dogs are animated when they hunt in a pack, than when they pursue their game apart.
        ◦ This can proceed from nothing but sympathy.
    • When two packs, that are strangers to each other, are joined, hunters know that dogs become more animated, sometimes even too animated. .
        ◦ We might be unable to explain this phenomenon, if we did not have a similar experience in ourselves.
 
    • Envy and malice are passions very remarkable in animals.
        ◦ They are perhaps more common than pity, as requiring less effort of thought and imagination.
