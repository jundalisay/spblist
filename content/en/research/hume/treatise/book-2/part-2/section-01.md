SEC. 1: THE OBJECT AND CAUSES OF LOVE AND HATRED
    • It is impossible to define love and hatred.
        ◦ Because they produce merely a simple impression, without any mixture or composition.
    • It would be as unnecessary to describe them from their nature, origin, causes and objects because they are sufficiently known from our common feeling and experience.
        ◦ We have already observed this concerning pride and humility.
    • There is a great resemblance between these two sets of passions.
        ◦ We shall abridge of our reasonings on pride and humility to explain love and hatred.
    • The immediate object of pride and humility is self or that identical person whose thoughts, actions, and sensations we are intimately conscious of.
        ◦ The object of love and hatred is some other person, whose thoughts, actions, and sensations we are not conscious of.
    • This is sufficiently evident from experience.
        ◦ Our love and hatred are always directed to some sensible being external to us.
        ◦ When we talk of self-love, it is not in a proper sense,
        ◦ the sensation it produces does anything in common with that tender emotion excited by a friend or mistress.
    • It is the same case with hatred.
        ◦ We may be mortified by our own faults and follies.
        ◦ but never feel any anger or hatred except from the injuries of others.
    • But though the object of love and hatred is always some other person.
        ◦ It is plain that the object is not the cause of these passions or alone sufficient to excite them.
    • Love and hatred:
        ◦ are directly contrary in their sensation
        ◦ have the same object in common.
            ▪ If that object were also their cause, it would produce these opposite passions in an equal degree.
            ▪ They must, from the very first moment, destroy each other.
            ▪ None of them would ever be able to make its appearance.
    • Therefore, there must be some cause different from the object.
    • The causes of love and hatred:
        ◦ are very much diversified.
        ◦ do not have many things in common.
    • The virtue, knowledge, wit, good sense, good humour of any person, produce love and esteem, and hatred and contempt.
        ◦ The same passions arise from:
            ▪ bodily accomplishments, such as beauty, force, swiftness, dexterity; and their contraries
            ▪ from the external advantages and disadvantages of family, possession, clothes, nation and climate.
    • From these causes, we derive a new distinction between:
        ◦ the quality that operates
        ◦ the subject on which it is placed.
    • A prince that has a stately palace, commands the esteem of the people:
        ◦ at first, by the beauty of the palace
        ◦ secondly, by the relation of property, which connects the beauty with him.
    • The removal of either of these destroys the passion.
        ◦ It proves that the cause is a compounded one.
    • It would be tedious to trace the passions of love and hatred, through all our observations on pride and humility equally applicable to both.
    • Generally:
        ◦ the object of love and hatred is some thinking person
        ◦ the sensation of the love is always agreeable, and of hatred is uneasy.
    • We can show with probability, that
        ◦ the cause of both passions is always related to a thinking being
        ◦ the cause of love produces a separate pleasure
        ◦ the cause of of the latter a separate uneasiness.
    • The supposition, that the cause of love and hatred must be related to a thinking being in order to produce them, is:
        ◦ probable
        ◦ too obvious to be contested.
    • The following excite no love or hatred, esteem or contempt towards those unrelated to them:
        ◦ virtue and vice in the abstract
        ◦ beauty and deformity, when placed on inanimate objects
        ◦ poverty and riches when belonging to a third person.
    • A person looking out at a window sees me in the street and a beautiful palace unrelated to me.
        ◦ This person will not pay me the same respect, as if I were owner of the palace.
    • It is not so evident at first sight, that:
        ◦ a relation of impressions is requisite to these passions
        ◦ because in the transition the one impression is so much confounded with the other, that they become indistinguishable.
    • But as in pride and humility, we have easily been able to:
        ◦ make the separation
        ◦ prove that every cause of these passions produces a separate pain or pleasure
    • I might use this method to examine the causes of love and hatred.
        ◦ But I delay this examination for a moment.
    • Instead, I shall convert all my reaaonings on pride and humility to my present purpose, by an argument founded on unquestionable examination.
    • Persons satisfied with their own character, genius, or fortune desire to:
        ◦ show themselves to the world
        ◦ acquire mankind’s love and approbation.
    • The very same qualities and circumstances which cause pride or self-esteem also cause vanity.
        ◦ We always view those particulars which best satisfies ourselves.
    • But if love and esteem were not produced by the same qualities as pride, as these qualities are related to ourselves or others, this method would be very absurd.
        ◦ Men could not expect a correspondence in the sentiments of every other person, with those themselves have entertained.
    • Few can form exact systems of the passions, or make reflections on their general nature and resemblances.
    • But without such a progress in philosophy, we are not subject to many mistakes in this.
    • We are guided by common experience and a kind of presentation which tells us what will operate on others, by what we feel immediately in ourselves.
    • The same qualities that produce pride or humility cause love or hatred.
        ◦ All the arguments to prove that the causes of pride and humility excite a pain or pleasure, will be applicable with equal evidence to the causes of love and hatred.
