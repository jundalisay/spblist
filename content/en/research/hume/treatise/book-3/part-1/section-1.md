Preface

This book is meant to be the foundation of my two other book series, The Simple Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Simple Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith, as the origins of Smith's ideas on the division of labor and sympathy have their origins in this work of David Hume, an original genius of the Scottish Enlightenment.

Introduction

This book series simplifies David Hume's Treatise of Human Nature in order to make it more understandable for casual readers and easier to cite in presentations and academic papers for economists and students. Simplification was done by simplifying each paragraph into sentences in bullet form, without removing any important idea. Thus, the long sentence below:

“But a great part of all the different branches of our woollen manufacture, of our tanned leather, and of our hardware, are annually exported to other European countries without any bounty, and these are the manufactures which employ the greatest number of hands.”

is simplified as follows, without losing any of the original ideas:

    Most of our manufactures below employ the most hands, and are exported to other European countries without a bounty:
        woollen manufactures
        tanned leather
        hardware

Below are other notes on simplification:

    Words that Hume has written in all capital letters in the original work have been changed into italics
    Important phrases and ideas have been made bold
    Maxims established by Hume are in bold italics
    Statements by other authors are in gray text
    Maxims or important ideas by other authors are in bold gray text
    Some paragraphs have a heading in bold indicating the important general topic of the paragraph
    Latin paragraphs have been removed. As much as possible, latin phrases have been converted to their english equivalent, except for a priori and a fortiori, which have been italicized.
    Phrases such as “It is evident that..” have been removed, to imply that all statements come from obvious observation, unless otherwise stated.



Part 1: Virtue and Vice in General

Summary

According to Hume, Morality is not based on Reason. -->



## Reason Is Not The Basis Of Morality

Obscure reasoning has an inconvenience which:
- may silence an antagonist without convincing him, and
- requires the same intense study for us to know its force, as that which was needed for its invention.

When we go into the real world, the conclusions of obscure reasoning seem to vanish.

It is hard for us to even retain that conviction we had attained with difficulty.

This is still more conspicuous in a long chain of reasoning, where we:
- must preserve the evidence of the first propositions to the end, and
- often lose sight of the most received maxims of philosophy.

I hope:
- that the present system of philosophy will acquire new force as it advances, and
- that our reasonings on morals will corroborate whatever has been said on the understanding and the passions.

Morality is a subject that interests us above all others.

We think that the peace of society is at stake in every decision concerning it.
- This concern makes our speculations appear more real and solid, than when the subject is indifferent to us.

What affects us can never be an illusion.

Our passion is engaged on our self or on society.

We naturally think that morality lies within human comprehension.
- In other cases of this nature, we are apt to doubt this.
- Without this advantage, I would have never begun a third volume of such obscure philosophy

Nothing is ever present to the mind but its perceptions.
- All the actions of seeing, hearing, judging, loving, hating, and thinking are perceptions.
- The mind can never exert itself in any action that cannot be called a perception.
- Consequently, 'perception' is also applicable to our judgments on moral good and evil.
  - To approve of one character and to condemn another are just different perceptions.

Perceptions resolve themselves into impressions and ideas.

This distinction raises a question:
- Is it through our ideas or impressions that we:
  - distinguish between vice and virtue, and
  - call an action blameable or praiseworthy?

This will immediately:
- cut off all loose discourses, and
- make the present subject more precise.

Some think:
- That virtue is just a conformity to reason,
- That there are eternal fitness and unfitness of things, which are the same to every rational being, and
- That the immutable measures of right and wrong impose an obligation on humans and on the Deity himself.

All these systems believe that morality, like truth, is discerned merely by:
- ideas, and
- their juxtaposition and comparison.

To judge these systems, we only need to consider whether it is possible, from reason alone, to distinguish:
- between moral good and evil, or
- whether some other principles must concur to enable us to make that distinction.

If morality naturally had no influence on human passions and actions, it would be in vain to inculcate it.
- It would be fruitless to have that multitude of rules and precepts from all moralists.

Philosophy is commonly divided into:
- speculative, and
- practical.

Morality is always comprehended under practical philosophy.

Morality is supposed to:
- influence our passions and actions, and
- go beyond the calm and indolent judgments of the understanding.

Our common experience confirms this by informing us that men are:
- often governed by their duties,
- deterred from some actions by the thought of injustice, and
- impelled to others by the thought of obligation.

Morals influence our actions and affections.
- But reason alone can never have any such influence
- Thus, morals cannot be derived from reason.

Morals excite passions and produce or prevent actions.
- Reason is utterly impotent in this.

Therefore, the rules of morality are not conclusions of our reason.

No one can deny this.
- This can only be denied by denying its founding principle.
- We cannot say that morality is discovered only by a deduction of reason, as long as reason has no influence on our passions and actions.

An active principle can never be founded on an inactive one.

If reason were inactive in itself, it must remain inactive in all its shapes and appearances, whether it:
- exerts itself in natural or moral subjects, or
- considers the:
  - powers of external bodies, or
  - actions of rational beings.
