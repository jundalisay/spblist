<!-- Then, we shall give a detailed description of the map. -->

{{< i s="/graphics/history/earth.jpg" a="Earth map" >}}

<!-- ### DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE MAP 44 -->

I will give a detailed description and a general description.

The detailed description consists of a discussion of each country, mountain, sea, and river of the cultivated part of the earth. This discussion will be found in the following section.

The general description is about the division of the cultivated part of the earth into 7 zones, their latitudinal (extension), and the length of their days. Such is the contents of this section.

<!-- 45 -->
The earth floats on the elemental water like a grape. God's plan for civilization and for the elemental generation of life resulted in making part of the earth free of water. 

The part that is free of water is said to constitute half the earth's surface. The cultivated part is 1/4 of it. The rest is uncultivated.

According to another opinion, the cultivated part is only 1/6 of it. 

The empty areas of the part which is free of water lie to the south and to the north. The cultivated area in between forms a continuum that stretches from west to east. 

There is no empty area between the cultivated part and the (Surrounding) Sea in these 2 directions.

Across the cultivated part, an imaginary line runs from west to east facing the equinoctial line of the firmament in regions where the two poles of the firmament are on the horizon.
- At this line civilization begins.
- It extends from there northwards.

Ptolemy said: "Civilization extends beyond that line to the south." He indicated the latitudinal extension, as will be mentioned.
<!-- 46  47 48 -->

Ishaq b. al-Hasan al-Khazini is one of the leading scholars in geography. 
- He believes that there is another civilization beyond Zone 7 to the north. 
- He indicated its latitudinal extension.
