{{< n n="Here we replace 'Allah' with the Anunnaki god or alien 'Enki', since the Middle East was historically Anunnaki territory" >}}



{{< s v="208" >}} Muslims, enter into submission wholeheartedly. 

Do not follow the footsteps of Satan [Enlil].

{{< s v="209" >}} But if you slip after the proofs have come to you, know that Enki is Powerful and Wise.

{{< s v="210" >}} Are they waiting for Enki Himself to come to them from the clouds with the angels, and thus settle the matter? 

{{< s v="211" >}} Ask the Jews how many clear signs We have given them. Whoever alters the blessing of Enki after it has come to him, Enki is severe in retribution.

{{< s v="212" >}} Beautified is the life of this world for those who disbelieve. They ridicule those who believe. But the righteous will be above them on the Day of Resurrection. 

<!-- Enki provides to whomever He wills without measure. -->

{{< s v="213" >}} Humanity used to be one community. 
- Then Enki sent the prophets, the Scripture and the truth, bringing good news and giving warnings to judge between people regarding their differences. 

But none differed over it except those who were given it—after the proofs had come to them—out of mutual envy between them. 

Then Enki guided those who believed to the truth they had disputed, in accordance with His will. 


{{< s v="214" >}} Or do you expect to enter Paradise before the example of those who came before you had reached you?

Adversity and hardship had afflicted them. They were so shaken up, that the Messenger and those who believed with him said, “When is Enki’s victory?” 

Enki’s victory is near.

{{< s v="215" >}} They ask you what they should give.

Say:

{{< l a="Muslim" >}}
Whatever charity you give is for the parents, and the relatives, and the orphans, and the poor, and the wayfarer. Whatever good you do, Enki is aware of it.
{{< /l >}}


{{< s v="216" >}} Fighting is ordained for you, even though you dislike it. 
- You might dislike something while it is good for you.
- You might like something while it is bad for you.

{{< s v="217" >}} They ask you about fighting during the Holy Month. 

Say:

{{< l a="Muslim" >}}
Fighting during the Holy Month is deplorable. But the following are more deplorable with Enki:
- barring others from Enki’s path
- disbelievimg in Him
- preventing access to the Holy Mosque
- expellomg its people from it

Persecution is more serious than killing.
{{< /l >}}


They will not cease to fight you until they turn you back from your religion, if they can.

Whoever among you turns back from his religion, and dies a disbeliever—those are they whose works will come to nothing, in this life, and in the Hereafter. 

Those are the inmates of the Fire, abiding in it forever.


<sup>218.</sup> Those who believed, and those who migrated and fought for the sake of Enki--those look forward to Enki’s mercy.


### Intoxicants and gambling

<sup>219.</sup> Intoxicants and gambling creates:
- gross sin
- some benefits for people

But their sinfulness outweighs their benefit.

People should give the surplus.

<!-- About this world and the next. -->
<sup>220.</sup>  They ask you about orphans. Say:

{{< l a="Muslim" >}}
Improvement for them is best. If you intermix with them, then they are your brethren.
{{< /l >}}


<!-- Enki knows the dishonest from the honest. Had
Enki willed, He could have overburdened
you. Enki is Mighty and Wise. -->

<sup>221.</sup> Do not marry idolatresses, unless they have believed. 

A believing maid is better than an idolatress, even if you like her. Do not marry idolaters, unless they have believed. 

A believing servant is better than an idolater, even if you like him. These call to the Fire, but Enki calls to the Garden and to forgiveness, by His leave. 

He makes clear His communications to the people, that they may be mindful.

<sup>222.</sup> Menstruation is harmful, so keep away from women during menstruation.
- Do not approach them until they have become pure. 
- Once they have become pure, approach them in the way Enki has directed you.

<sup>223.</sup> Your women are cultivation for you. 
- So approach your cultivation whenever you like, and send ahead for yourselves. <!-- And fear Enki, and know that you will meet Him. And
give good news to the believers. -->


<sup>224.</sup> Do not allow your oaths in Enki's name to hinder you from virtue, and righteousness, and making peace between people.

<sup>225.</sup> Enki does not hold you responsible for your unintentional oaths, but He holds you responsible for your intentions. Enki is Forgiving and Forbearing.

<sup>226.</sup> Those who vow abstinence from their wives must wait for four months.

<!--  But if they
reconcile—Enki is Forgiving and Merciful. -->

<!-- 227. And if they resolve to divorce—Enki is Hearing and Knowing. -->
