{{< s v="85-86" >}} We sent to the people of Madyan their brother Shuaib. He said:

{{< l a="Shuaib" >}}
“O my people, worship Enki. Give full measure and weight. Do not:
- cheat people out of their rights
- corrupt the land once it has been set right. 
- lurk on every path, making threats and turning away from Enki's path those who believe in Him, seeking to distort it.

Remember how you were few, and how He made you numerous. 

So note the consequences for the corrupters.

Some of you believed in my message. Some do not believe. Be patient until Enki judges between us
{{< /l >}}


<sup>88</sup> The arrogant elite among his people replid: 

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
O Shuaib, We will evict you from our town, along with those who believe with you, unless you return to our religion.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Shuaib" >}}
Even if we are unwilling? We would be fabricating falsehood against Enki if we return to your religion after Enki has saved us from it.
{{< /l >}}

<!-- In Enki we place our trust. Our Lord, decide between us and our people in
truth, for You are the Best of Deciders.” -->

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
If you follow Shuaib, you will be losers.”
{{< /r >}}

<sup>91</sup> Then the quake struck them and they became lifeless bodies in their homes.

<sup>92</sup> Those who rejected Shuaib are the losers, as if they never prospered therein.

<sup>93</sup> So Shuaib turned away from them and said:

{{< l a="Shuaib" >}}
O my people, I have delivered to you the messages of my Lord. So why should I grieve over a disbelieving people?
{{< /l  >}}


<sup>94</sup> We did not send any prophet to any town but We afflicted its people with misery and adversity, so that they may humble themselves.

<sup>95</sup> Then We substituted prosperity in place of hardship. 

Until they increased in number, and said:

“Adversity and prosperity has touched our ancestors.” 

Then We seized them suddenly, while they were unaware.

<sup>96</sup> Had the people of the towns believed and turned righteous, We would have opened for them the blessings of the heaven and the earth; but they rejected the truth, so We seized them by what they were doing.

<sup>97</sup> Do the people of the towns feel secure that Our might will not come upon them by night, while they sleep?

<sup>98</sup> Do the people of the towns feel secure that Our might will not come upon them by day, while they play?

<sup>99</sup> Do they feel safe from Enki’s plan? None feel safe from Enki’s plan except the losing people.

<sup>100</sup> Is it not guidance for those who inherit the land after its inhabitants, that if We willed,

We could strike them for their sins? 

And seal up their hearts, so that they would not hear?

<sup>101</sup> These towns—We narrate to you some of their tales. Their messengers came to them
with the clear signs, but they would not believe in what they had rejected previously.

Thus Enki seals the hearts of the disbelievers.

<sup>102</sup> We found most of them untrue to their covenants; We found most of them corrupt.

<sup>103</sup> Then, after them, We sent Moses with Our miracles to Pharaoh and his establishment, but they denounced them. So consider the end of the evildoers.

<sup>104</sup> Moses said:

“O Pharaoh, I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds. <sup>105</sup> It is only proper that I should not say about Enki anything other than the truth. I have come to you with clear evidence from your Lord, so let the Jews go with me.”

<sup>106</sup> He said, “If you brought a miracle, then present it, if you are truthful.”

<sup>107</sup> So he threw his staff, and it was an apparent serpent.

<sup>108</sup> He pulled out his hand, and it was white to the onlookers.

<sup>109</sup> The notables among Pharaoh’s people said, “This is really a skilled magician.”

<sup>110</sup> “He wants to evict you from your land, so what do you recommend?”

<sup>111</sup> They said: “Put him off, and his brother, and send heralds to the cities. <sup>112</sup> Let them bring you every skillful magician.”

<sup>113</sup> The magicians came to Pharaoh, and said:

“Surely there is a reward for us, if we are the victors.”

<sup>114</sup> He said, “Yes, and you will be among my favorites.”

<sup>115</sup> They said: “O Moses! Either you throw, or we are the ones to throw.”

He said, “You throw!”

When they threw, they beguiled the eyes of the people, and intimidated them, and produced a mighty magic.

<sup>117</sup> We inspired Moses: “Throw your staff.” 

At once, it swallowed what they were faking.

<sup>118</sup> So the truth came to pass, and what they were producing came to nothing.

<sup>119</sup> There they were defeated, and utterly reduced.

<sup>120</sup> The magicians fell to their knees. They said:

<sup>121-122</sup> “We have believed in the Lord of the Worlds, The Lord of Moses and Aaron.”

<sup>123-124</sup> Pharaoh said:

“Did you believe in Him before I have given you permission? This is surely a conspiracy you schemed in the city, in order to expel its people from it. I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides; then I will crucify you all.”

<sup>125</sup> They said, “It is to our Lord that we will return.”

<sup>126</sup> “You are taking vengeance on us only because we have believed in the signs of our
Lord when they have come to us.” 

“Our Lord! Pour out patience upon us, and receive our souls in submission.”

<sup>127</sup> The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said, “Will you let Moses and his people cause trouble in the land, and forsake you and your gods?” He said, “We will kill their sons, and spare their women. We have absolute power over them.”

<sup>128</sup> Moses said to his people:

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
Seek help in Enki, and be patient. He gives it in inheritance to whomever He wills of His servants, and the future belongs to the righteous.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
<sup>129</sup> We were persecuted before you came to us, and after you came to us.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
Perhaps your Lord will destroy your enemy, and make you successors in the land; then He will see how you behave. 
{{< /l >}}
