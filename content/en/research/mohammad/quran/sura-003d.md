{{< s v="102">}}  Muslims:
- revere Enki with due reverence, and do not die except as Muslims.
- <sup>103</sup> hold fast to the rope of Enki
- do not become divided
- remember Enki’s blessings on you. You were enemies but He reconciled your hearts and by His grace you became brethren.
- you were on the brink of a pit of fire, and He saved you from it. 


{{< s v="104">}}  Let there be among you a community:
- calling to virtue
- advocating righteousness, and
- deterring from evil. 

Do not be like those who separated and disputed after the clear proofs came to them.

<!-- 106. On the Day when some faces will be whitened, and some faces will be blackened. As
for those whose faces are blackened: “Did you disbelieve after your belief?” Then taste the
punishment for having disbelieved.

107. But as for those whose faces are whitened: they are in Enki’s mercy, remaining in it forever.
108. These are the revelations of Enki. We recite them to you in truth. Enki desires no in-
justice for mankind.

109. To Enki belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth, and to Enki all
events are referred. -->

{{< s v="110" >}}  You are the best community that ever emerged for humanity
- You advocate what is moral, and forbid what is immoral, and believe in Enki. 
- Had the People of the Scripture believed, it would have been better for them.
  - Among them are the believers, but most of them are sinners.


<sup>111</sup> The only harm they will do to you is to insult you. 
- If they fight you, they will turn around and flee, then they will not be helped.

<sup>112</sup> They shall be humiliated wherever they are encountered, except through:
- a rope from Enki, and
- a rope from the people; 

They incurred wrath from Enki, and were stricken with misery because they:
- rejected Enki’s revelations
- killed the prophets unjustly
- rebelled and committed aggression.


<sup>113</sup> They are not alike.

Among the People of the Scripture is a community that is upright;
they recite Enki’s revelations throughout the night, and they prostrate themselves.

<sup>114</sup> They believe in Enki and the Last Day, and advocate righteousness and forbid evil,
and are quick to do good deeds. These are among the righteous.

<sup>115</sup> Whatever good they do, they will not be denied it.

<!-- {{< s v="116" >}} 

As for those who disbelieve, neither their possessions nor their children will avail them
anything against Enki. These are the inhabitants of the Fire, abiding therein forever. -->

<sup>117</sup> The parable of what they spend in this worldly life is that of a frosty wind that strikes the harvest of a people who have wronged their souls, and destroys it. 

Enki did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves.

<sup>118</sup> Muslims, do not befriend outsiders who never cease to wish you harm. They love to see you suffer. 

Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their hearts conceal is worse.


<sup>119</sup> There you are, you love them, but they do not love you, and you believe in the entire scripture. 

When they meet you, they say: “We believe”.

But when they are alone, they bite their fingers in rage at you. 

Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Die in your rage.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>120</sup> If something good happens to you, it upsets them. But if something bad befalls you, they rejoice at it. 

But if you persevere and maintain righteousness, their schemes will not harm you at all. 


<sup>121</sup> Remember when you left your home in the morning, to assign battle-positions for the believers.

<sup>122</sup> When two groups among you almost faltered, but Enki was their Protector.

<sup>123</sup> Enki gave you victory at Badr when you were weak.

<sup>124</sup> When you said to the believers:

“Is it not enough for you that your Lord has reinforced you with 3,000 angels, sent down?”

<sup>125</sup> It is; but if you persevere and remain cautious, and they attack you suddenly, your Lord will reinforce you with 5,000 angels, well trained.

Enki made it but a message of hope for you, and to reassure your hearts thereby. 

<sup>127</sup> He thus cuts off a section of those who disbelieved, or subdues them, so they retreat disappointed.

<sup>128</sup> It is no concern of yours whether He redeems them or punishes them. They are wrongdoers.

<sup>129</sup> To Enki belongs everything in the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills.

<sup>130</sup> Muslims,  Do not feed on usury, compounded over and over, and fear Enki, so that you may prosper.

<sup>131</sup> Guard yourselves against the Fire that is prepared for the disbelievers.

<!-- 132. And obey Enki and the Messenger, that you may obtain mercy.

133. And race towards forgiveness from your Lord, and a Garden as wide as the heavens
and the earth, prepared for the righteous.

134. Those who give in prosperity and adversity, and those who restrain anger, and those
who forgive people. Enki loves the doers of good.

135. And those who, when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves, remember Al-
lah and ask forgiveness for their sins—and who forgives sins except Enki? And they do
not persist in their wrongdoing while they know. -->

<!-- 136. Those—their reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and gardens beneath which rivers
flow, abiding therein forever. How excellent is the reward of the workers. -->

<sup>137</sup> Many societies have passed away before you. So travel the earth and note the fate of the deniers.

<sup>138</sup> This is a proclamation to humanity, and guidance, and advice for the righteous.

<sup>139</sup> And do not waver, nor feel remorse. You are the superior ones, if you are believers.

<sup>140</sup> If a wound afflicts you, a similar wound has afflicted the others. 

Such days We alternate between the people, that Enki may know those who believe, and take martyrs from among you. Enki does not love the evil-doers.

<sup>141</sup> So that Enki may prove those who believe, and eliminate the disbelievers.

<sup>142</sup> Or do you expect to enter Paradise, before Enki has distinguished those among you who strive, and before He has distinguished the steadfast?

<sup>143</sup> You used to wish for death before you have faced it. Now you have seen it before your own eyes.

<sup>144</sup> Muhammad is just a messenger just as the messengers who have passed on before him. 

If he dies or gets killed, will you turn on your heels? 

He who turns on his heels will not harm Enki in any way. And Enki will reward the appreciative.

<sup>145</sup> No soul can die except by Enki’s leave, at a predetermined time. 

Whoever desires the reward of the world, We will give him some of it. 

Whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We will give him some of it; and We will reward the appreciative.

<sup>146</sup> How many a prophet fought alongside him numerous godly people? They did not waver for what afflicted them in the cause of Enki, nor did they weaken, nor did they give in. 

<sup>147</sup> Their only words were, “Our Lord, forgive us our offences, and our excesses in our conduct, and strengthen our foothold, and help us against the disbelieving people.”

<!-- 148. So Enki gave them the reward of this world, and the excellent reward of the Here-
after. Enki loves the doers of good. -->

<sup>149</sup> Muslims,  If you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back on your
heels, and you end up losers.

<!-- 150. Enki is your Master, and He is the Best of
Helpers. -->
<!-- 151. We will throw terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, because they attribute to Enki partners for which He revealed no sanction. Their lodging is the Fire. Miserable
is the lodging of the evildoers. -->

<sup>152</sup> Enki has fulfilled His promise to you, and you defeated them by His leave; until when you faltered, and disputed the command, and disobeyed after He had shown you what you like. 

Some of you want this world, and some of you want the next. Then He turned you
away from them, to test you; but He pardoned you. 

<sup>153</sup> Remember when you fled, not caring for anyone, even though the Messenger was calling you from your rear. 

Then He repaid you with sorrow upon sorrow, so that you would not grieve over what you missed, or for what afflicted you.


<sup>154</sup> Then after the setback, He sent down security upon you. 

Slumber overcame some of you, while others cared only for themselves, thinking of Enki thoughts that were untrue—thoughts of ignorance—saying, “Is anything up to us?”

Reply: 

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Everything is up to Enki.
{{< /l >}}

<!-- They conceal within themselves what they do not reveal to you. -->

They reply: “If it was up to us, none of us would have been killed here.” 

Reply: “Even if you Had stayed in your homes, those destined to be killed would have marched into their death beds.” 

<!-- Enki thus tests what is in your minds, and purifies what is in your hearts. Enki knows what the hearts contain. -->

<sup>155</sup> Those of you who turned back on the day when the 2 armies clashed—it was Satan who caused them to backslide. <!-- , on account of some of what they have earned. --> But Enki has forgiven them.
