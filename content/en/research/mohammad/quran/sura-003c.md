{{< s v="59-60" >}} The likeness of Jesus in Enki’s sight is that of Adam. 

Enki created Jesus from dust, then said to him, “Be,” and he was. 

<!-- 60. The truth is from your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt. -->

{{< s v="61 ">}}  If anyone disputes with you about him, <!-- after the knowledge that has come to you, --> say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Let us call our children and your children, and our women and your women, and ourselves and yourselves, and let us invoke Enki’s curse on the liars.
{{< /l >}}

<!-- 62. This is the narrative of truth: there is no god but Enki. Enki is the Mighty, the Wise.

63. But if they turn away—Enki knows the corrupt. -->


{{< s v="64">}}  Say to the Jews and Christians: 

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Come to terms common between us and you. We worship only Enki. We associate nothing with Him.
{{< /l >}}


<!-- And if they turn away, say, “Bear witness that we have submitted.” -->

{{< s v="66">}} People of the Book! Why do you argue about Abraham, when the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him? 

<!-- Will you not reason? -->

<sup>66</sup> You argue about things you know, but why do you argue about things you do not know?

<sup>67-68</sup> Abraham was a Muslim, not a Jew, nor a Christian, nor a Polytheist.

<!-- 68. The people most deserving of Abraham are those who followed him, and this prophet,
and those who believe. -->

<sup>69-70</sup> A party of the People of the Book would love to lead you astray. But they only lead themselves astray. They do not realize it.

<!-- 70. O People of the Book! Why do you reject the revelations of Enki, even as you witness?

71. O People of the Book! Why do you confound the truth with falsehood, and knowingly conceal the truth? -->

<sup>72-74</sup> Some of the People of the Book say:

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
Believe in what was revealed to the believers at the beginning of the day, and reject it at its end, so that they may return. Trust none except those who follow your religion.
{{< /r >}}

Reply:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Guidance is Enki’s guidance.
{{< /l >}}

If someone is given the like of what you were given, or they argue with you before your Lord, say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
All grace is in Enki’s hand. He gives it to whomever He wills.
{{< /l >}}
<!-- 74. He specifies His mercy for whomever He wills.  -->

<sup>75</sup> Among the People of the Book is he, who, if you entrust him with a heap of gold, he will give it back to you. 

Among them is he, who, if you entrust him with a single coin, he will not give it back to you, unless you keep after him. 

That is because they say:

{{< l a="Jews" >}}
We are under no obligation towards the gentiles.
{{< /l >}}


They tell lies about Enki, and they know it.

<sup>76</sup> Whoever fulfills his commitments and maintains piety—Enki loves the pious.

<sup>77</sup> Those who exchange the covenant of Enki, and their vows, for a small price, will have no share in the Hereafter. 

Enki will not speak to them, nor will He look at them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them. They will have a painful punishment.

<sup>78</sup> Among them are those who twist the Scripture with their tongues, that you may think it from the Scripture, when it is not from the Scripture.

They say “It is from Enki,” when it is not from Enki. They tell lies and attribute them to Enki, knowingly.

<sup>79</sup> No person to whom Enki has given the Scripture, and wisdom, and prophethood would ever say to the people: “Be my worshipers rather than Enki’s.” 

Rather, “Be people of the Lord, according to the Scripture you teach, and the teachings you learn.”

<sup>80</sup> Nor would he command you to take the angels and the prophets as lords. Would he command you to infidelity after you have submitted?

<sup>81</sup> Enki received the covenant of the prophets:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
I have given you scripture and wisdom. If a messenger comes to you verifying what you have, you shall believe him and support him. Do you affirm My covenant and take it upon yourselves?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
We affirm it.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses.
{{< /l >}}

Whoever turns away after that—these are the deceitful.

<sup>83</sup> Do they desire other than the religion of Enki, when to Him has submitted everything in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him they will be returned?

<sup>84</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
We believe:
- in Enki
- in what was revealed to us, to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Patriarchs
- in what was given to Moses, and Jesus, and the prophets from their Lord.

We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we submit.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>85-93</sup> Whoever seeks other than Islam as a religion, it will not be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.

<!-- 86. How will Enki guide a people who disbelieved after having believed, and had witnessed that the Messenger is true, and the clear proofs had come to them? Enki does not guide the unjust people.

87. Those—their penalty is that upon them falls the curse of Enki, and of the angels, and of all mankind.

88. Remaining in it eternally, without their punishment being eased from them, and
without being reprieved.

89. Except those who repent afterwards, and reform; for Enki is Forgiving and Merciful.

90. As for those who disbelieve after having believed, then plunge deeper into disbelief,
their repentance will not be accepted; these are the lost.

91. As for those who disbelieve and die disbelievers, even the earth full of gold would not
be accepted from any of them, were he to offer it for ransom. These will have a painful
torment, and will have no saviors.

92. You will not attain virtuous conduct until you give of what you cherish. Whatever you
give away, Enki is aware of it. -->

<sup>93</sup> All food was permissible to the Jews, except what Israel forbade for itself before the Torah was revealed. 

Say to them: 

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Bring the Torah, and read it, if you are truthful.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>94</sup> Whoever forges lies about Enki after that—these are the unjust.

<sup>95</sup> Say

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Enki has spoken the truth, so follow the religion of Abraham the Monotheist; he was not a Pagan.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>96</sup> The first house established for mankind is the one at Bekka; blessed, and guidance for all people.

<sup>97</sup> In it are evident signs; the Station of Abraham. 

Whoever enters it attains security. Pilgrimage to the House is a duty to Enki for all who can make the journey. <!-- But as for those who refuse—Enki is Independent of the worlds. -->

<sup>98</sup> Say to the Jews and Christians:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Why do you reject the Revelations of Enki, when Enki witnesses what you do?

Why do you hinder from Enki’s path those who believe, seeking to distort it, even though you are witnesses?
{{< /l >}}


<sup>100</sup> Muslims, If you obey a party of those who were given the Scripture, they will turn you, after your belief, into disbelievers.

<!-- 101. And how could you disbelieve, when Enki’s revelations are being recited to you, and
among you is His Messenger? Whoever cleaves to Enki has been guided to a straight
path. -->
