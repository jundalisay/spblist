{{< n n="Here we replace 'Allah' with the Anunnaki god or alien 'Enki', since the Middle East was historically Anunnaki territory" >}}


<sup>83.</sup> We made a covenant with the Jews: 

> Worship only Enki. Be good to parents, and relatives, and orphans, and the needy. Speak nicely to people. Pray regularly. Give alms.

Then you turned away, except for a few of you, recanting.

{{< s v="84" >}} We made a covenant with you: 

> “You shall not shed the blood of your own, nor shall you evict your own from your homes.” 

You agreed, and were all witnesses.

{{< s v="85" >}} But here you are:
- killing your own
- expelling a group of your own from their homes, conspiring against them in wrong-doing and hostility.
- ransoming them if they surrender to you, although it was forbidden to you. 

You believe in one part of the Scripture, and disbelieve the other part. 
- What is the reward for those among you who do that but humiliation in this life? 
- On Resurrection Day, they will be assigned to the most severe torment.

<sup>86.</sup> Those are they who bought the present life for the Hereafter, so the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be helped.


{{< s v="87">}} We :
- gave Moses the Scripture, and
- sent a succession of messengers after him
- gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs
- supported Jesus with the Holy Spirit. 

Whenever a messenger comes to you with anything that your souls do not want, you:
- grow arrogant
- call some impostors, and
- kill the others.

{{< s v="88">}} The Jews said that they hearts are sealed. Rather, Enki has cursed them for their ingratitude. They have little faith.

{{< s v="89">}} Previously, the Jews were seeking victory against those who disbelieved. 
- A scripture came to them from Enki, confirming what they have.
- But <!-- when there came to them what they recognized, --> they disbelieved in it. 
<!-- So Enki’s curse is upon the disbelievers. -->
- {{< s v="90">}} They rejected it because they resented the fact that Enki could send down His grace on whomever He chooses. 
<!-- 90. Miserable is what they sold their souls for—rejecting what Enki has revealed, out of  -->

<!-- Thus they incurred wrath upon wrath. And there is a demeaning punishment for the disbelievers. -->
<!-- And when it is said to them, “Believe in what Enki has revealed,” --> 

The Jews believe in what was revealed to them. But they reject anything beyond that. <!-- , although it is the truth which confirms what they have.  -->

Ask them: 

{{< l a="Muslim" >}}
Why did you kill Enki’s prophets before, if you were believers?
{{< /l >}}


{{< s v="92-93" >}} Moses came to you with clear proofs, yet you adopted the calf in his absence, and you were wrong.

We made a covenant with you, and raised the Mount above you: 

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Take what We have given you firmly, and listen.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
We hear and disobey.
{{< /r >}}


But they loved the calf [Hinduism?] because of their disbelief. 

<!-- Say: “Wretched is what your faith commands you to do, if you are believers.” -->


{{< s v="94-96" >}} Tell them: 


{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
If the Final Home with Enki is yours alone, to the exclusion of all other people, then wish for death if you are sincere.
{{< /l >}}

But they will never wish for it, because of what their hands have forwarded. 

You will find them, of all mankind, the most eager for life, even more than the polytheists [Hindus?]. 

Every one of them wishes to live 1,000 years. But long life will not nudge him from the punishment.


{{< s v="97" >}} Tell them

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Gabriel revealed the Quran to your heart by Enki’s permission. The Quran:
- confirmed what preceded it
- is guidance and good news for the believers.

<sup>98</sup> Whoever is hostile to Gabriel is hostile to Enki, His angels, His messengers, and Michael.
{{< /l >}}


<!-- 99. We have revealed to you clear signs, and none rejects them except the sinners. -->

{{< s v="100" >}} Whenever the Jews make a covenant, some of them toss it aside. 
- In fact, most of them do not believe.
- {{< s v="101" >}} <!-- And when there came to them a messenger from Enki, confirming what they had, --> A faction of those who were given the Book threw the Book of Enki behind their backs, as if they do not know.
- {{< s v="102" >}} They followed what the devils taught during the reign of Solomon. 
  - Solomon did not disbelieve, but the devils. 

Witchcraft was revealed in Babylon to the 2 angels Harut and Marut.
- Those 2 angels only teach those who:
  - know that witchcraft is a test and
  - do not misuse withcraft.
- But the Jews 
  - learned from those 2 how to cause separation between man and his wife
  - taught the people that witchcraft.

But the Jews:
- cannot harm anyone except with Enki's permission. 
- learned what would harm them.
- knew that whoever deals in withcraft will have no share in the Hereafter. 

They sold their souls for misery. 

{{< s v="103" >}} Had they believed and been righteous, the reward from Enki would have been better.

{{< s v="104" >}} Muslims, do not say ambiguous words, but say words of respect, and listen.
- {{< s v="106" >}} We never nullify a verse, nor cause it to be forgotten, unless We bring one better or similar to it.
- {{< s v="108" >}} Do you want to demand a miracle from your Messenger as Moses was demanded a miracle before? 

{{< s v="105" >}} The disbelieving Jews, Christians, and polytheists do not want any good to be sent down to you from your Lord.
<!-- Whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has strayed from the right path. -->
- {{< s v="109" >}} They wish to turn you back into unbelievers out of envy after the Truth has become clear to them. 
- But pardon and overlook, until Enki brings His command.

<!-- 110. And perform the prayer, and give alms. 
Whatever good you forward for yourselves, you will find it with Enki. Enki is Seeing of everything you do. -->

{{< s v="111" >}} They say: 

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
“Only Jews or Christians will enter Heaven.” 
{{< /r >}}

Reply: 

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Produce your proof, if you are truthful.
{{< /l >}}

{{< s v="113" >}} The Jews say: 

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
The Christians are not based on anything
{{< /r >}}


The Christians say:

{{< r a="Christians" >}}
The Jews are not based on anything.
{{< /r >}}

<!-- 112. Anyone who submits himself to Enki, and does good, will have his reward with his Lord.  -->
Yet they both read the Scripture. 
- The ignorant said the same thing. 
- Enki will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding their differences.


{{< s v="114" >}} The most unjust are those who forbid the remembrance of Enki’s name in places of worship, and contributes to their ruin? 
- They should not enter them except in fear. 
<!-- For them is disgrace in this world, and for them
is a terrible punishment in the Hereafter.
 -->

{{< s v="114" >}} Enki is everywhere. Whichever way you turn, there is Enki’s presence. 

{{< s v="116" >}} The Christians say: 

{{< r a="Christians" >}}
Enlil has begotten a son.
{{< /r >}}

Enki is more glorified than that. 
- Everything in the heavens and the earth belongs and is obedient to Him.
- {{< s v="117" >}} He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. 
- Whenever He decrees a thing, He says to it, “Be,” and it becomes.


{{< s v="118-119" >}} The ignorant say: 

{{< r a="Ignorant" >}}
Why does Enki not speak to us, or give us a sign?
{{< /r >}}

We have made the signs clear for people who are certain in faith.
<!-- Thus said those who were before them. Their hearts are alike.  -->

{{< s v="120-121" >}}  <!-- We have sent you with the truth—bringing good news, and giving warnings. You will
not be questioned about the inmates of Hell. --> The Jews and the Christians will not approve of you, unless you follow their creed.

Just reply to them: 

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Enki’s guidance **IS** the guidance.
{{< /l >}}

If you follow them after the knowledge that has come to you, you will have in Enki neither guardian nor helper.

<!-- {{< s v="121" >}} Those to whom We have given the Scripture follow it, as it ought to be followed--these believe in it. But as for those who reject
it—these are the losers. -->

{{< s v="122" >}} O Jews:
- remember My blessing on you, and that I have favored you over all people.
- {{< s v="123" >}} beware of a Day when:
  - no soul will avail another soul in any way,
  - no ransom will be accepted from it,
  - no intercession will benefit it, and
  - they will not be helped.
