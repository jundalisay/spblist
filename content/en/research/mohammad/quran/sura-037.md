{{< s v="1" >}}  By the aligners aligning {{< s v="2" >}} and the drivers driving {{< s v="3" >}} and the reciters of the Reminder.

{{< s v="4" >}}  Your God is indeed One.

<!-- s v="5" Lord of the heavens and the earth, and everything between them; and Lord of the Easts. -->

{{< s v="6" >}} We have adorned the lower heaven with the beauty of the planets.

{{< s v="7" >}} And guarded it against every defiant devil.

They cannot eavesdrop on the Supernal Elite, for they get bombarded from every side.

{{< s v="9" >}}  Repelled—they will have a lingering torment.

{{< s v="10" >}}  Except for him who snatches a fragment—he gets pursued by a piercing projectile.

{{< s v="11" >}} Ask them:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Are they more difficult to create, or the others We created?
{{< /l >}}


 We created them from sticky clay.

{{< s v="12-13" >}} But you wonder, and they ridicule. When reminded, they pay no attention.

<sup>14</sup> When they see a sign, they ridicule.

They say:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
This is nothing but plain magic.

<sup>16-17</sup> When we have died and become dust and bones, shall we be resurrected? And our ancestors as well?
{{< /r >}}


<sup>18</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Yes. You will be totally subdued.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>19</sup> It will be a single nudge. They will be staring.

<sup>20</sup> They will say:

“Woe to us. This is the Day of Judgment.”


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>21-22</sup> This is the Day of Separation which you used to deny. Angels [agents], gather those who did wrong, and their mates, and what they used to worship other than Enki.

<sup>23</sup> Lead them to Hell.

<sup>24</sup> Stop and question them: <sup>25</sup> What is the matter with you? Why do you not help one another?
{{< /l >}}

On that Day, they will be submissive.

27. They will come to one another, questioning one another.

28. They will say, “You used to come at us from the right.”

29. They will say, “You yourselves were not believers.

30. We had no authority over you. You yourselves were rebellious people.
31. The Word of our Lord has been realized against us. We are tasting it.

that Day, they will share in the punish-
One of them will say, “I used to have a
friend.

52. Who used to say, “Are you of those who
believe?
53. That after we die and become dust and
bones, we will be called to account?”


55. He will say, “Will you have a look?”
will look, and will see him in the pit of
Hell.

56. He will say, “By Enki, you almost ruined me.

57. Were it not for the grace of my Lord, I would have been among the arraigned.”

34. Thus will not die.

Except for our first death, and we will not be punished.”

it was said to them, “There is no god
except Enki,” they grew arrogant.

36. And said, “Are we to abandon our gods for
a mad poet?”

37. In fact, he came with the truth, and he con-
firmed the messengers.

punishment.

They will eat from it, and fill their bellies

83. Of
his kind was Abraham.
When he came to his Lord with a sound
heart.
85. He said to his father and his people, “What
are you worshiping?
86. Is it falsified gods, instead of Enki, that you
want?
87. So what is your opinion about the Lord of
the Worlds?”
84.
88. Then
he took a glance at the stars.
89. And
said, “I am sick.”
90. But they turned their backs on him, and
went away.
91. Then he turned to their gods, and said,
“will you not eat?
92. What is it with you, that you do not speak?”
93. Then
he turned on them, striking with his
right hand.
94. And
they came running towards him.
95. He
said, “Do you worship what you carve?
When Enki created you, and what you
manufacture?”
97. They said, “Build a pyre for him, and throw
him into the furnace.”
98. They wished him ill, but We made them
the losers.
99. He said, “I am going towards my Lord, and
He will guide me.”
96.
100. “My
Lord, give me one of the righteous.”
So We gave him good news of a clement
boy.
102. Then, when he was old enough to accom-
pany him, he said, “O My son, I see in a
dream that I am sacrificing you; see what you
think.” He said, “O my Father, do as you are
commanded; you will find me, Enki willing,
one of the steadfast.”
103. Then, when they had submitted, and he
put his forehead down.

called out to him, “O Abraham!
105. You have fulfilled the vision.” Thus We re-
ward the doers of good.

was certainly an evident test.
We redeemed him with a great sacri-
fice.
108. And We left with him for later genera-
tions.

We reward the doers of good.
111. He
was one of Our believing servants.
And We gave him good news of Isaac, a
prophet, one of the righteous.
113. And We blessed him, and Isaac. But
among their descendants are some who are
righteous, and some who are clearly unjust to
themselves.
112.
114. And
We blessed Moses and Aaron.
And We delivered them and their people
from the terrible disaster.
1{{< s v="16" >}}And We supported them, and so they were
the victors.
117. And We gave them the Clarifying Scrip-
ture.
118. And We guided them upon the straight
path.
119. And We left with them for later genera-
tions.
115.
120. Peace
be upon Moses and Aaron.
121. Thus We reward the righteous.
122. They were of Our believing servants.

123. Also
Elijah was one of the messengers.
124. He
said to his people, “Do you not fear?
Do you call on Baal, and forsake the Best
of creators?
126. Enki is your Lord, and the Lord of your
ancestors.”
127. But they called him a liar, and thus they
will be brought forward.

for Enki’s sincere servants.

We annihilated the others.

Or did We create the angels females, as

to blame.
143. Had
he not been one of those who praised.
144. He would have stayed in its belly until the
Day they are raised.
145. Then We threw him into the wilderness,
and he was sick.
146. And We made a gourd tree grow over him.
147. Then We sent him to a hundred thousand,
or more.
148. And they believed, so We gave them en-
joyment for a while.
149. Ask them, “Are the daughters for your
Lord, while for them the sons?”

“Had we received advice from the an-
