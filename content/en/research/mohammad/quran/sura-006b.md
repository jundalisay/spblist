{{< s v="68" >}} When you encounter those who gossip about Our revelations, turn away from them, until they engage in another topic. 

But should Satan make you forget, do not sit after the recollection with the wicked people.

<sup>70</sup> So leave alone those:
- who take their religion for play and pastime, and
- whom the worldly life has deceived.

But remind him, lest his soul becomes damned because of it. His soul has no helper or intercessor besides Enki. Even if it offers every equivalent, none will be accepted from it.

These are the ones who are delivered to perdition by their actions. They will have a drink of scalding water, and a painful punishment, because they used to disbelieve.

<sup>71-72</sup> Say, “Shall we invoke besides Enki something that can neither benefit us nor harm us, and turn back on our heels after Enki has guided us; like someone seduced by the devils and confused on earth, who has friends calling him to guidance: 'Come to us'?” 

Say, “The guidance of Enki is the guidance, and we are commanded to:
- surrender to the Lord of the Universe.
- perform the prayers
- revere Him; it is to Him that you will be gathered.”

<sup>73</sup> It is He who created the heavens and the earth in truth. On the Day when He says: “Be,” it will be. 

His saying is the truth, and His is the sovereignty on the Day when the trumpet is blown. 
The Knower of secrets and declarations. He is the Wise, the Expert.

<sup>74</sup> Abraham said to his father Azar:

{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
Do you take idols for gods? I see that you and your people are in evident error.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>75</sup> Thus We showed Abraham the empire of the heavens and the earth, that he might be one of those with certainty.

<sup>76</sup> When the night fell over him, he saw a planet. 

{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
This is my lord.
{{< /l >}}

But when it set, he said:

{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
I do not love those that set.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>77</sup> Then, he saw the moon rising:

{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
This is my lord.
{{< /l >}}

But when it set, he said:

{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
If my Lord does not guide me, I will be one of the erring people.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>78-79</sup> Then, when he saw the sun rising, he said, 

{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
This is my lord, this is bigger.
{{< /l >}}

But when it set, he said:

{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
O my people, I am innocent of your idolatry. I have directed my attention towards Him Who created the heavens and the earth—a monotheist—and I am not of the idolaters.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>80-81</sup> His people argued with him. 

{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
Do you argue with me about Enki, when He has guided me? I do not fear what you associate with Him, unless my Lord wills it. My Lord comprehends all things in knowledge.

Will you not reconsider? Why should I fear those you associate with Him, and you do not fear associating others with Enki for which He sent down to you no authority? Which side is more entitled to security, if you are aware?”
{{< /l >}}

<sup>82</sup> Those who believe, and do not obscure their faith with wrongdoing—those will have security, and they are guided.

<sup>83</sup> That was Our argument which We gave to Abraham against his people. 
<!-- We elevate by degrees whomever We will.  -->

<sup>84-89</sup> We gave him Isaac and Jacob—each of them We guided.

We guided Noah previously. From his descendants David, and Solomon, and Job, and Joseph, and Moses, and Aaron. Thus We reward the righteous.

Zechariah, John, Jesus, and Elias were upright.

We favored Ishmael, Elijah, Jonah, and Lot over all other people.

And of their ancestors, and their descendants, and their siblings—We chose them, and
guided them to a straight path.

<!-- 88. Such is Enki’s guidance. He guides with it
whomever He wills of His servants. Had they
associated, their deeds would have gone in
vain. -->

We gave the Book, wisdom, and prophethood to them. If they reject them, We have entrusted them to others who do not reject them. 

The righteous are in no way accountable for them; it is only a reminder, that they may be careful.

<sup>90.</sup> Enki has guided them, so follow their guidance. 

Say, “I ask of you no compensation for it; it is just a reminder for all mankind.”


<sup>91.</sup> They do not value Enki as He should be valued, when they say, “Enki did not reveal anything to any human being.”

Say, “Who revealed the Scripture which Moses brought—a light and guidance for humanity?” You put it on scrolls, displaying them, yet concealing much.

You were taught what you did not know—neither you, nor your ancestors. Say, “Enki;” then leave them toying away in their speculation.

<sup>92</sup> This too is a Scripture that We revealed—blessed—verifying what preceded it, that you may warn the Mother of Cities and all around it. 

<!-- Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and are dedicated to their prayers. -->

<sup>93</sup> Who does greater wrong than someone who invents falsehood against Enki, or says, “It was revealed to me,” when nothing was revealed to him, or says, “I will reveal the like of what Enki revealed”? 

If only you could see the wrongdoers in the floods of death, as the angels with arms outstretched: 

“Give up your souls. Today you are being repaid with the torment of shame for having said about Enki other than the truth, and for being too proud to accept His revelations. <sup>94</sup> You have come to Us individually, just as We created you the first time, leaving behind you everything We gave you. We do not see with you your intercessors—those you claimed were your partners. The link between you is cut, and what you had asserted has failed you.”

<!-- 95. It is Enki Who splits the grain and the seed. He brings the living from the dead, and
He brings the dead from the living. Such is Enki. So how could you deviate?
96. It is He Who breaks the dawn. And He
made the night for rest, and the sun and the
moon for calculation. Such is the disposition
of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.
