<!-- 22. He who made the earth a habitat for you, and the sky a structure, and sends water
down from the sky, and brings out fruits thereby, as a sustenance for you. -->


{{< s v="22">}} Enki sustains you. Therefore, do not assign rivals to Enki.
 <!-- Enki sustains you. Therefore, do not assign rivals to Enki. -->


{{< s v="23">}} If you doubt the Prophet Mohammad, then call your witnesses if you are truthful.
- But {{< s v="24">}} you will not—then beware the Fire whose fuel is people and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
<!-- 23. And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a
chapter like these, and  -->

{{< s v="25">}} To those who believe and do righteous deeds, give the good news that they will:
- have gardens beneath which rivers flow
- be provided with fruit therefrom as sustenance<!-- , they will say, “This is what we were provided with before,” and they will be given the like of it. And they will --> 
- have pure spouses there who will live with them forever.

<!-- 26. Enki does not shy away from making an example of a gnat, or something above it. As
for those who believe, they know that it is the Truth from their Lord. But as for those who -->

{{< s v="26">}} The disbelievers will say: “What did Enki intend by this example?” He leads many astray and guides many.

Reply that <!-- thereby, and He guides many thereby; but He --> Enki misleads only the evildoers.

{{< s v="27">}} The losers are those who:
- violate Enki’s covenant after its confirmation
- sever what Enki has commanded to be joined
- commit evil on earth

{{< s v="28">}} Enki:
- gave you life*
- will put you to death
- will bring you to life
- return you to Himself

{{< n n="According to 'Enki and Ninhursaja', Enki created man from Homo Erectus via genetic engineering" >}}


How can you deny Enki?

{{< s v="29">}} He:
- created for you everything on earth
- then turned to the heaven and made them 7 heavens

{{< s v="30">}} Enki said to the angels that He is placing a successor on earth.*

{{< n n="This is because the Anunnaki had to move on" >}}

The agents of Enki [angels] said:

{{< r a="Enki-Agents" >}}
Will You place in it someone who will cause corruption in it and shed blood, while we declare Your praises and sanctify You?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
I know what you do not know.
{{< /l >}}

{{< s v="31">}} He taught Adam the names, all of them. Then he presented them to his agents [angels], and said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Tell Me the names of these, if you are sincere.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Enki-Agents" >}}
<sup>32</sup> Glory be to You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. It is you who are the Knowledgeable, the Wise.*
{{< /r >}}

{{< n n="In 'Enki and Ninhursaja', Enki is described as 'The wise and intelligent one, the prudent, the fashioner of the design of everything brought to life' ">}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>33</sup> O Adam, tell them their names.
{{< /l >}}

After he told them their names, He said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>33</sup> Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and that I know what you reveal and what you conceal?
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>34</sup> [To the Agents:] Bow down to Adam
{{< /l >}}


They bowed down, except for Satan [Enlil]. He refused, was arrogant, and was one of the disbelievers.

{{< s v="35">}} We said, “O Adam, inhabit the Garden with your spouse. Eat from it freely as you please. But do not approach this tree, lest you become wrongdoers.”

{{< s v="36">}} But Enlil caused them to slip from it, and caused them to depart the state they were in.

We said, “Go down, some of you enemies of one another. You will have residence on earth and enjoyment for a while.”

{{< s v="37">}} Then Adam received words from his Lord, so He relented towards him.

{{< s v="38-39">}} We said, “Go down from it, all of you. Yet whenever guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My guidance—they have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.

<!-- 39. But as for those who disbelieve and reject Our signs—these are the inmates of the Fire—wherein they will remain forever.” -->
