<!-- 1. Alif, Lam, Meem, Saad. -->

<!-- Scripture was revealed to you, so let there be no anxiety in your heart because of it. 

You are to warn with it—and a reminder for the believers.
{{< s v="3" >}}  Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord, and do not follow other masters beside
Him. Little you recollect. -->


{{< s v="4" >}}  How many towns have We destroyed? 

Our might came upon them by night, or while they were napping.

{{< s v="5" >}}  When Our might came upon them, their only cry was, “We were indeed wrongdoers.”

<!-- 6. We will question those to whom messengers were sent, and We will question the messengers.

7. We will narrate to them with knowledge, for We were never absent. -->

<sup>8</sup> The scales on that Day will be just. Those whose weights are heavy—it is they who are the successful.

{{< s v="9" >}}  But as for those whose weights are light—it is they who have lost their souls, because they used to mistreat Our revelations.

{{< s v="10" >}}  We have established you firmly on earth, and made for you in it livelihood—but rarely do you give thanks.

{{< s v="11" >}}  We created you, then We shaped you, then We said to the angels: 

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Bow down before Adam
{{< /l >}}

So they bowed down, except for Satan [Enlil-Faction]. 

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
What prevented you from bowing down to Adam when I commanded it?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Enlil-Faction" >}}
I am better than Adam. 
- You created me from fire.
- You created him from mud.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
It is not for you to act arrogantly in it. Get out! You are one of the lowly!
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Enlil-Faction" >}}
Give me a break until the Day they are resurrected. Because you have lured me, I will waylay them on Your straight path. Then I will come at them from before them, and from behind them, and from their right, and from their left. You will not find most of them appreciative.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Yes I will give you a break. Leave Paradise. Whoever among them follows you—I will fill up Hell with you all. Adam, inhabit the Garden with your wife. Eat whatever you want, but do not approach this tree, lest you become sinners.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>20</sup> But Enlil whispered to them to reveal their nakedness, which was invisible to them. He said:

{{< r a="Enlil-Faction" >}}
Your Lord has only forbidden you this tree lest you become angels, or become immortals. I am a sincere advisor to you.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>22</sup> So he lured them with deceit.

When they tasted the tree, their nakedness became evident to them. They began covering themselves with the leaves of the Garden.

Their Lord called out to them:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Did I not forbid you from this tree, and say to you that Satan is a sworn enemy to you?”
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Adam" >}}
We have done wrong to ourselves. Unless You forgive us, and have mercy on us, we will be among the losers.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Fall, some of you enemies to one another. On earth you will have residence and livelihood for a while.

In it you will live, and in it you will die, and from it you will be brought out.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>26</sup> O children of Adam! We have provided you with clothing to cover your bodies, and for luxury. But the clothing of piety—that is best. 

<sup>27</sup> O Children of Adam! 

Do not let Satan seduce you, as he drove your parents out of the Garden, stripping them of their garments, to show them their nakedness.

He sees you, him and his clan, from where you cannot see them. We have made the devils friends of
those who do not believe. 

<sup>28</sup> When they commit an indecency, they say, 

“We found our parents doing this, and Enki has commanded us to do it.” 

Say:

“Enki does not command indecencies. Are you attributing to Enki what you do not know?”

<!-- 29. Say, “My Lord commands justice, and to stand devoted at every place of worship. 


Him alone. Just as He originated you, so you will return.”

30. Some He has guided, and some have de-
served misguidance. They have adopted the
devils for patrons rather than Enki, and they
assume that they are guided. -->

<sup>31</sup> O Children of Adam! Dress properly at every place of worship, and eat and drink, but do not be excessive. He does not love the excessive.

<sup>32</sup> Say:

“Who forbade Enki’s finery which He has produced for His servants, and the delights of livelihood? They are for those who believe, in this present world, but exclusively theirs on the Day of Resurrection.” 

We thus detail the revelations for people who know.

<sup>33</sup> Say:

“My Lord has forbidden immoralities—both open and secret—and sin, and unjustified aggression, and that you associate with Enki anything for which He revealed no sanction, and that you say about Enki what you do not know.”

<sup>34</sup> For every nation is an appointed time.

When their time has come, they cannot delay it by one hour, nor can they advance it.

<sup>35</sup> O Children of Adam! When messengers from among you come to you, relating to you My revelations—whoever practices piety and reforms—upon them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.

<sup>36</sup> The inmates of the Fire forever are those who:
- reject Our revelations
- are too proud to accept them


<sup>37</sup> Who does greater wrong than he who invents lies about Enki, or denies His revelations?

<!-- These—their share of the decree will reach them.  -->

Our angels will come to them to take their souls away. 

{{< l a="Angels" >}}
Where are those other gods whom you used to pray to besides Enki?” 
{{< /l >}}

They will say:

{{< r a="Ignorant" >}}
They have abandoned us.
{{< /r >}}

They will testify against themselves that they were faithless.

<sup>38</sup> Enki will say:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Join the crowds of jinn and humans who have gone into the Fire* before you.
{{< /l >}}

{{< n n="This was the comet impact around 10,800 BC. The Jinn are other alien races inferior to the Anunnaki" >}}

<!-- They have not entered it, but they are hoping. -->

Every time a crowd enters, it will curse the crowd before it. The last of them will say of the first:

{{< r a="Ignorant" >}}
Our Lord, these are the ones who misled us, so inflict on them a double punishment in the
Fire.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Each will have a double, but you do not know.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>39</sup> The first of them will say to the last of them,

{{< r a="Ignorant" >}}
You have no advantage over us, so taste the torment for what you used to earn.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>40</sup> Those who reject Our revelations and are too arrogant to uphold them—the doors of
Heaven will not be opened for them, nor will they enter Paradise, until the camel passes
through the eye of the needle. 

Thus We repay the guilty.

<!-- 41. For them is a couch of hell, and above them
are sheets of fire. Thus We repay the wrong-
doers. -->

<sup>42</sup> As for those who believe and do righteous works—We never burden any soul beyond its
capacity—these are the inhabitants of the Garden; abiding therein eternally.

<sup>43</sup> We will remove whatever rancor is in their hearts. Rivers will flow beneath them. 

They will say:

“Praise be to Enki, who has guided us to this. Had Enki not guided us, we would never be guided. The messengers of our Lord did come with the truth.”

It will be proclaimed to them:

“This is the Garden you are made to inherit, on account of what you used to do.”

<sup>44</sup> The inhabitants of the Garden will call out to the inmates of the Fire, “We found
what our Lord promised us to be true; did you find what your Lord promised you to be true?” 

They will say, “Yes.” Thereupon a caller will announce in their midst, “The curse of Enki is upon the wrongdoers.”

<!-- 45. “Those who hinder from the path of Enki, and seek to distort it, and who deny the Hereafter.” -->

<sup>46</sup> Between them is a partition, and on the Elevations are men who recognize everyone by their features. 

They will call to the inhabitants of the Garden, “Peace be upon


<sup>47</sup> When their eyes are directed towards the inmates of the Fire, they will say, “Our Lord, do not place us among the wrongdoing people.”
