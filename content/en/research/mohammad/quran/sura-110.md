## 110. VICTORY (an-Nasr)

{{< s v="1-3" >}} When the victory of Enki has come <!-- and the conquest -->, and you see the people entering into the religion of AllŒh in multitudes, then exalt Him with praise and ask forgiveness of Him. 

<!-- Let
them worship the Lord of this House.{{< s v="4" >}}  Who has fed them against hunger, and has
secured them against fear. -->


## 111. THORNS (al-Masad )

{{< s v="1" >}}  Condemned is Abu Lahab and his hands. 

{{< s v="2" >}}  His wealth did not avail him, nor did what he acquired. 

{{< s v="3" >}}  He will burn in a Flaming Fire.

{{< s v="4" >}}  And his wife—the firewood carrier.

{{< s v="5" >}}  Around her neck is a rope of thorns.


## 112. MONOTHEISM (al-Ikhlas )

{{< s v="1-4" >}}  Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
He is Enki, the One, the Absolute. He begets not, nor was He begotten. There is nothing comparable to Him.
{{< /l >}}



## 113. DAYBREAK (al-Falaq)

{{< s v="1-5" >}}  Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
I take refuge with the Lord of Daybreak:
- from the evil of what He created. 
- from the evil of those who practice sorcery.
- from the evil of an envious when he envies.
{{< /l >}}


## 114. MANKIND (an-Nas)

{{< s v="1-6" >}}  Say: 

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
I seek refuge in the Lord, King, God of mankind:
- from the evil of the sneaky whisperer who whispers into the hearts of people
- from among jinn and among people.
{{< /l >}}
