description: "The wrongdoers set aside for Enki a share of the crops and the livestock He created"
---


{{< s v="135" >}}  Say, “O my people! Work according to your ability, and so will I.” 

<!-- You will come to know to whom will belong the sequel of the
abode.” The wrongdoers will not prevail. -->

{{< s v="136" >}}  The wrongdoers set aside for Enki a share of the crops and the livestock He created, and they say, “This is for Enki,” according to their claim, “and this is for our idols.” 

But the share of their idols does not reach Enki, yet the share of Enki reaches their idols. Evil is their judgment.


<sup>137</sup> Likewise, their idols entice many idolaters to kill their children, in order to lead them to their ruin, and confuse them in their religion. 

Had Enki willed, they would not have done it; so leave them to their fraud.

<sup>138</sup> They say:

“These animals and crops are restricted; none may eat them except those we permit,” 

by their claims, and animals whose backs are forbidden, and animals over which they do not pronounce the name of Enki—fabricating lies against Him. 

He will repay them for what they used to invent.

<sup>139</sup> They say, “What lies in the wombs of these animals is exclusively for our males, and prohibited to our wives.” 

But if it is still-born, they can share in it. He will surely punish them for their allegations.

<sup>140</sup> Lost are those who kill their children foolishly, with no basis in knowledge, and forbid what Enki has provided for them—innovations about Enki. 


<sup>141</sup> It is He who produces gardens, both cultivated and wild, and date-palms, and crops of diverse tastes, and olives and pomegranates, similar and dissimilar. 

Eat of its fruit when it yields, and give its due on the day of its harvest, and do not waste. 

<sup>142</sup> Among the livestock are some for transportation, and some for clothing. 

<!-- Eat of what
Enki has provided for you, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. He is to you an outright enemy. -->

<sup>143</sup> They are 8 mates: 2 of the sheep, and 2 of the goats. 

Say:

“Did He forbid the two males, or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Inform me with knowledge, if you are truthful.”

<sup>144</sup> And two of the camels, and two of the cattle. Say:

“Did He forbid the two males, or the 2 females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Were you present when Enki enjoined this upon you?” 

Who does greater wrong than he who invents lies and attributes them to Enki, in order to mislead
people without knowledge? Enki does not guide the wicked people.

<sup>145</sup> Say:

“In what was revealed to me, I find nothing forbidden to a consumer who eats it, except carrion, or spilled blood, or the flesh of swine—because it is impure—or a sinful offering dedicated to other than Enki. But if someone is compelled by necessity, without being deliberate or malicious"

<sup>146</sup> To the Jews We forbade everything with claws. 

Of the cattle and sheep, We forbade them their fat, except what adheres to their backs, or the entrails, or what is mixed with bone.

<!-- This is how We penalized them for their inequity. We are indeed truthful. -->

<sup>147</sup> If they accuse you of lying, say:

“Your Lord is Possessor of infinite mercy, but His wrath cannot be averted from the guilty people.” 

<sup>148</sup> The polytheists will say:

“Had Enki willed, we would not have practiced idolatry, nor would have our forefathers, nor would we have prohibited anything.” 

Likewise those before them lied, until they tasted Our might.

Say:

“Do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us? You follow nothing but conjecture, and you only guess. 

<sup>149</sup> To Enki belongs the conclusive argument. Had He willed, He would have guided you all. <sup>150</sup> Produce your witnesses who would testify that Enki has prohibited this.” 

If they testify, do not testify with them. And do not follow the whims of those who deny Our revelation, and those who do not believe in the Hereafter, and those who equate others with their Lord.
 

<sup>151</sup> Say:

“Come, let me tell you what your Lord has forbidden you: that you associate nothing with Him; that you honor your parents; that you do not kill your children because of poverty—We provide for you and for them; that you do not come near indecencies, whether outward or inward; and that you do not kill the soul which Enki has sanctified—except in the course of justice. All this He has enjoined upon you, so that you may understand.”

<sup>152</sup> Do not come near the property of the orphan, except with the best intentions, until he reaches maturity.

Give full weight and full measure, equitably. 

<!-- We do not burden any soul beyond its capacity.  -->

When you speak, be fair, even if it concerns a close relative. 

<!-- Fulfill your covenant with Enki. All this He has enjoined upon you, so that you may take heed. -->

<sup>153</sup> This is My path, straight, so follow it. 

Do not follow the other paths, lest they divert you from His path. All this He has enjoined
upon you, that you may refrain from wrongdoing.

<sup>154</sup> Then We gave Moses the Scripture, perfect for the righteous, and explaining everything clearly, and a beacon, and mercy, that they may believe in the encounter with their Lord.

<sup>155</sup> This too is a blessed Scripture that We revealed; so follow it, and be righteous, that you may receive mercy.

<sup>156</sup> Lest you say, “The Scripture was revealed to 2 parties before us, and we were unaware of their teachings.”

<sup>157</sup> Or lest you say, “Had the Scripture been revealed to us, we would have been better guided than they.” 

Clarification has come to you from your Lord, and guidance, and mercy. 

Who then does greater wrong than he who gives the lie to Enki's messages, and turns away from them? We will repay those who turn away from Our messages with the worst kind of punishment, because of their turning away.

<sup>158</sup> Are they waiting for anything but for the angels to come to them, or for your Lord to arrive, or for some of your Lord’s signs to come? 

On the Day when some of your Lord’s signs come, no soul will benefit from its faith unless it had believed previously, or had earned goodness through its faith. Say, “Wait, we too are waiting.”

<sup>159</sup> As for those who divided their religion and became sects—you have nothing to do with them.

Their case rests with Enki; then He will inform them of what they used to do.

<sup>160</sup> Whoever comes up with a good deed will have ten times its like; and whoever comes up with an evil deed will be repaid only with its equivalent—they will not be wronged.

<sup>161</sup> Say:

“My Lord has guided me to a straight path, an upright religion, the creed of Abraham the Monotheist, who was not a polytheist.”

<!-- 162. Say, “My prayer and my worship, and my life and my death, are devoted to Enki, the Lord of the Worlds. 

163. No associate has He. Thus I am commanded, and I am the first of those who submit.

164. Say, “Am I to seek a Lord other than Enki, when He is the Lord of all things?” No soul gets except what it is due, and no soul bears the burdens of another. Then to your Lord is your return, then He will inform you regarding your disputes.

165. It is He who made you successors on the earth, and raised some of you in ranks over
others, in order to test you through what He has given you.
