Only recently have thinkers become aware of the difficulty of finding a beginning in philosophy. 

What philosophy begins with must be either mediated or immediate. It can be neither the one nor the other.


{{< s v="89" >}}  The principle of a philosophy also expresses an objective beginning, the beginning of everything.*

{{< n n="This is only true in Western Philosophy. Asian Philosophy correctly knows that space and time are illusions and so beginning is not correct. Instead, Asian Philosophy is all about the IS or the nature of existence as dharma or true nature and purpose of existence. Western philosophy wasted a lot of effort on being and non-being, logic, apriori aposteriori, etc. But these are all effects of the Negative Force" >}}

- If this beginning refers to the nature of cognition, then it is only a criterion instead of being an objective determination
  - It is thought, intuition, sensation, ego, subjectivity itself.

What is the nature of the content?

What is the subjective particular beginning?

<!-- , and so too the need to find an answer to the question,  remains of no importance in face of the need for a principle in which alone the interest of the matter in hand seems to lie, the interest as to what is the truth, the absolute ground. -->


{{< s v="90" >}} The modern perplexity about a beginning comes from the dogmatics and the skeptics.
- The dogmatics require dogmatic demonstration of a principle
- The sceptical require a subjective criterion against dogmatic philosophising

<!-- , are not yet aware, and which is completely denied by those who begin, like a shot from a pistol,  -->

Both are based on inner revelation, faith, intellectual Intuition, etc.
- These are exempt from method and logic. 

Early abstract thought was interested in the principle only as content.

But in time, it was impelled to pay attention to the other side, to the behaviour of the cognitive process.*

{{< n n="Asian Philosophy deals with both content and cognitive process. But it realized that reality is an illusion and so its focus was a cognitive process to destroy identity and all content" >}}


Thus, the subjective act has also been grasped as an essential moment of objective truth.
- This brings with it the need to unite the method with the content, the form with the principle. 

Thus the principle should also be the beginning.
- What is the first for thought should also be the first in the process of thinking.


{{< s v="91" >}} How does the logical beginning appear?

The 2 sides from which it can be taken have already been named, either as:
- a mediated result or
- a beginning proper, as an immediacy.


{{< s v="92" >}} Is the knowledge of truth an immediate knowledge having a pure beginning, a faith? 

Or is it a mediated knowledge?

<!-- In so far as this can be dealt with preliminarily it has been done elsewhere.  -->

Absolutely everthing equally contains both immediacy and mediation.*
- These 2 are inseparable.

 <!-- and the opposition between them to be a nullity.  -->

The problem is that logical propositions that have immediacy and mediation lead to the discussion of their opposition and their truth.

This opposition is an effect of thinking, knowing, and cognition.
- These acts give a more concrete form to immediate or mediated knowledge.

<!-- it is the nature of cognition as such which is considered within the science of logic, while the more concrete form of cognition falls to be considered in the philosophy of spirit.  -->

Some people want the nature of cognition clarified prior to the science of logic.
- But this is to demand that cognition be considered outside the science.
- If so then cognition cannot be clarified.®

<!-- outside the science this cannot be accomplished, at least not in a scientific manner and such a manner is alone here in place.  -->


{{< s v="93" >}} The beginning is logical in that it is to be made in the element of thought that is free and for itself, in pure knowing.* 

{{< n n="In other words, the beginning is an idea that proves consciousness or the ideator. Pure knowing is really abtract ideation by an ideator, or as abstract thinking by a thinker" >}}


It is mediated because pure knowing is the ultimate, absolute truth of consciousness.

The phenomenology of spirit is the science of consciousness.*
- This science results in pure knowing.

{{< n n="In other words, the science of consciousness is the study of thinking, resulting in abstract thoughts" >}}

 <!-- the exposition of it, and that consciousness has for result the Notion of science, i.e.  -->

Logic has for its presupposition the science of manifested spirit, which contains and demonstrates the necessity, and so the truth, of the standpoint occupied by pure knowing and of its mediation.*

{{< n n="Logic requires a thinking thing to exist first in space and time." >}}

In this science of manifested spirit the beginning is made from empirical, sensuous consciousness.
- This is immediate knowledge.

{{< n n="Logic begins when the thinking thing gets an immediate sensory or physical thought" >}}

 <!-- in that work there is discussed the significance of this immediate knowledge.  -->

Other forms of consciousness are:
- belief in divine truths [divine thoughts]
- inner experience
- knowledge through inner revelation, etc.

These are not fit to be examples of immediate knowledge [sensory thoughts]. 

Immediate consciousness is also the first and that which is immediate in the science itself, and therefore the presupposition. 

But in logic, the presupposition is that which has proved itself to be the result of that phenomenological consideration — the Idea as pure knowledge.
