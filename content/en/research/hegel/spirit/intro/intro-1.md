<!-- **Preface**

An explanation, such as is customarily prefixed to a writing in a preface—about the purpose the author has set for himself in it, as well as about the occasions and the relation in which he believes it stands to other earlier or contemporary treatments of the same subject—seems not only superfluous but even inappropriate and counterproductive for a philosophical work due to the nature of the matter. For what might properly be said about philosophy in a preface—a historical account of the tendency and standpoint, the general content and results, a mix of assertions and assurances about the truth—cannot be considered as the manner in which philosophical truth should be presented. Because philosophy essentially operates in the element of universality, which encompasses the particular within itself, it gives rise more than other sciences to the appearance that the matter itself and even its complete essence are expressed in the purpose or the ultimate results, against which the execution seems to be the inessential. In contrast, in the general conception of, for example, what anatomy is, such as the knowledge of the parts of the body considered in their inanimate existence, it is clear that one does not yet possess the matter itself, the content of this science, but must also endeavor to know the particular.—Furthermore, in such an aggregate of knowledge, which does not rightfully deserve the name of science, a conversation about purpose and such generalities is not different from the historical and conceptless manner in which the content itself, these nerves, muscles, and so forth, is discussed. In philosophy, however, there would arise an inconsistency in that such a manner is employed, while at the same time being shown by philosophy itself to be incapable of grasping the truth.

Thus, through the determination of the relation that a philosophical work believes it has to other efforts on the same subject, an extraneous interest is introduced, and what is essential for the knowledge of the truth is obscured. As firm as the opinion is of the opposition between the true and the false, it also tends to expect either agreement or contradiction against an existing philosophical system, and in a statement about such a system to see only either one or the other. It does not comprehend the diversity of philosophical systems as much as the progressive development of truth, as it sees in the diversity only the contradiction. The bud disappears in the bursting forth of the blossom, and one could say that the former is refuted by the latter; similarly, the blossom is declared to be a false existence of the plant by the fruit, and the fruit takes the place of the blossom as its truth. These forms not only differ but also displace each other as mutually incompatible. However, their fluid nature simultaneously makes them moments of the organic unity in which they not only do not conflict, but one is as necessary as the other, and this equal necessity first constitutes the life of the whole. However, the opposition to a philosophical system tends not to understand itself in this way, nor does the apprehending consciousness generally know how to free it from its one-sidedness or to keep it free, and to recognize in the form of the conflicting and seemingly opposed elements the mutually necessary moments. -->



<!-- **Introduction**

It is a natural idea that before delving into the matter itself in philosophy, namely into the actual knowledge of what is truly existent, it is necessary to first come to an understanding about knowledge, which is viewed as the tool by which one takes hold of the absolute, or as the medium through which one glimpses it. The concern seems justified partly that there may be different kinds of knowledge, and among them one might be more suitable than another for achieving this ultimate goal, thereby making a false choice among them,—partly also that, since knowing is a faculty of a definite kind and scope, without a precise determination of its nature and limits, clouds of error might be grasped instead of the sky of truth. This concern must indeed transform itself into the conviction that the whole endeavor of acquiring what is inherent through knowledge to consciousness is, by its very concept, absurd, and that between knowing and the absolute there falls an insurmountable boundary. For if knowing is the tool to seize the absolute essence, it immediately appears that the application of a tool to a thing does not leave it as it is in itself, but rather modifies and transforms it. Or if knowing is not a tool of our activity, but somewhat a passive medium through which the light of truth reaches us, we likewise receive it not as it is in itself, but as it is through and in this medium. In both cases, we use a means that immediately produces the opposite of its purpose; or rather the absurdity is that we use a means at all. It seems, however, that this difficulty could be remedied by the knowledge of the workings of the tool, as this makes it possible to subtract the part that belongs to the tool from the result in the representation we get of the absolute, and thus retain the truth in its purity. But this improvement would, in fact, only bring us back to where we were before. If we remove from a shaped thing what the tool has done to it, the thing—here the absolute—is precisely as much as it was before this thus superfluous effort. If the absolute were only to be brought closer to us by the tool without altering it in any way, like a bird by the lime twig, it would likely mock this trick if it did not already exist for itself within us and want to be so; for in this case, knowing would be a trick, as it, through its various efforts, pretends to be doing something entirely different than just producing the immediate and thus effortless relationship. Or if the examination of knowing, which we imagine as a medium, teaches us the law of its refraction, it is equally useless to subtract this from the result; for it is not the breaking of the ray, but the ray itself, through which truth touches us, that is knowing, and subtracting this would only leave us with the pure direction or the empty place.

Meanwhile, if the concern about falling into error instills mistrust in the science which goes to work directly and actually knows without such scruples, it is not clear why there should not be, conversely, mistrust in this mistrust, and concern that this fear of error is already the error itself. In fact, it presupposes something, indeed several things, as truth and bases its concerns and conclusions on it, which itself must first be examined to see if it is true. It presupposes notions of knowing as a tool and medium, also an assumed distinction of ourselves from this knowing; especially, however, this, that the absolute stands on one side, and knowing on the other side, separate from the absolute, is nonetheless something real, or thereby, that knowing, which, being outside the absolute, is probably also outside the truth, is still supposed to be true; an assumption whereby what calls itself fear of error rather reveals itself as fear of the truth.

This conclusion results from the fact that the absolute alone is true, or the true alone is absolute. It can be rejected by the distinction that knowledge, which though not, as science wants, knows the absolute, yet is also true; and that knowing in general, if it is incapable of grasping the absolute, can still be capable of other truths. But we see gradually that such back-and-forth talk results in a vague distinction between an absolute truth and a different kind of truth, and the absolute, knowing, and so forth, are words that presuppose a meaning, which first must be attained. -->

The subject of philosophy is the actual knowledge of what truly is. 

Before it can do this, it must first understand knowledge, which is the instrument by which to see the Absolute. 
- There are various kinds of knowledge. 
- The wrong choice of knowledge towards the Absolute is possible. 
<!-- The apprehension seems legitimate, on the one hand that  -->


## The Quest for Absolute Knowledge

Knowing is a faculty of a definite kind and with a determinate range. 
- We might reach clouds of error instead of the heaven of truth if we do not determine the nature and limits of knowledge.

This chance of error creates apprehensiveness which can make us even think that the quest for Absolute knowledge is absurd. 

<!-- is sure to pass even into the conviction that the whole enterprise which sets out to secure for consciousness by means of knowledge what exists per se, is in its very nature absurd.  -->

Between knowledge and the Absolute, there is a boundary which completely cuts off the one from the other*.

{{< n n="Superphysics calls it aethereal boundary" >}}


If knowledge is the instrument to attain the absolute Reality, then the application of an instrument to anything does not expose the Absolute. 
- Rather, knowledge would have a mere moulding and alteration of the Absolute. 

If knowledge is not an instrument, but is instead a kind of passive medium through which the light of the truth reaches us, then here too we do not receive the Absolute as It is. 
- Instead, we get the medium-version of the Absolute.

In either case, we employ a means which immediately brings about the very opposite of its own end. 
- In other words, it is absurd to use any means at all. 

We might solve this by learning how the instrument of knowledge operates. 
- This will make it possible to remove from the result the part which belongs to the instrument.
- In this way, we get the pure Absolute.
<!-- truth in its purity.  -->

But this improvement would only bring us back to the point where we were before. 

A definitely-formed-thing is shaped by a mold or instrument. If we remove that mold, then the thing (the Absolute) stands before us once more just as it did before all this trouble. 
- That trouble, we now see, was superfluous. 

If the Absolute could be brought to us by removing the mold, then it would be a trick. 

 <!-- on the whole nearer to us by this agency, without any change being wrought in it, like a bird caught by a limestick, it would certainly scorn a trick of that sort, if it were not in its very nature, and did it not wish to be, beside us from the start.  -->

For a trick is what knowledge in such a case would be, since by all its busy toil and trouble it gives itself the air of doing something quite different from bringing about a relation that is merely immediate, and so a waste of time to establish. 

If the examination of knowledge were a medium, then we can learn of its law of refraction. 
- But it would be likewise useless to eliminate this refraction from the result. 
- This is because knowledge is not the divergence of the ray. Knowledge is the ray itself that transmits the truth to us.
- If this were removed, the bare direction or the empty place would alone be indicated.


## The Fear of Error

{{< s v='74' >}} The fear of error introduces distrust into science.
- But we can distrust that distrust 
- This will make the fear of error really merely a fear of *initial* error.   
<!-- , which without any scruples of that sort goes to work and actually does know, it is not easy to understand why, conversely, a distrust should not be placed in this very distrust, and why we should not take care lest the fear of error is not just the initial error. -->

This fear starts with ideas of knowledge as:
- an instrument, and
- as a medium.

It presupposes a distinction of ourselves from this knowledge. 
<!-- presupposes something, indeed a great deal, as truth, and supports its scruples and consequences on what should itself be examined beforehand to see whether it is truth. It  -->
- More especially it takes for granted 

The Absolute stands on one side
- Knowledge stands on the other side, by itself and cut off from the Absolute. This knowledge is still something real.
- By being outside the Absolute, knowledge is also outside truth.
- But knowledge is nevertheless true.

 <!-- — a position which, while calling itself  -->

 The fear of error thus is really the fear of being outside of truth.
 <!-- , makes itself known rather as fear of the truth. -->


{{< s v='75' >}}  **This conclusion comes from the fact that the Absolute alone is true or that the True is alone absolute.**

It may be set aside by making the following distinctions:
- A knowledge which does not know the Absolute, as science wants to do, is still true
- Knowledge in general might be incapable of grasping the Absolute. But it can still be capable of truth of another kind. 

But this kind of talk leads in the long run to a confused distinction between the absolute truth and a truth of some other sort.
- “Absolute”, “knowledge”, and so on, are words which presuppose a meaning that has first to be got at.
