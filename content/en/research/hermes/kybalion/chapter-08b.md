The Great Mental Plane comprises those forms of "living things" known to us in ordinary life, as well as certain other forms not so well known except to the occultist. 

The classification of the Seven Minor Mental Planes is more or less satisfactory and arbitrary (unless accompanied by elaborate explanations which are foreign to the purpose of this particular work), but we may as well mention them. They are as follows:


1. The Plane of Mineral Mind

This comprises the "states or conditions" of the units or entities, or groups and combinations of the same, which animate the forms known to us as "minerals, chemicals, etc." 

These entities must not be confounded with the molecules, atoms and corpuscles themselves, the latter being merely the material bodies or forms of these entities, just as a man's body is but his material form and not "himself." 

These entities may be called "souls" in one sense, and are living beings of a low degree of development, life, and mind—just a little more than the units of "living energy" which comprise the higher sub-divisions of the highest Physical Plane. 

The average mind does not generally attribute the possession of mind, soul, or life, to the mineral kingdom, but all occultists recognize the existence of the same, and modern science is rapidly moving forward to the point-of-view of the Hermetic, in this respect. 

The molecules, atoms and corpuscles have their "loves and hates"; "likes and dislikes"; "attractions and repulsions". "affinities and non-affinities," etc., and some of the more daring of modern scientific minds have expressed the opinion that the desire and will, emotions and feelings, of the atoms differ only in degree from those of men. We have no time or space to argue this matter here. 

All occultists know it to be a fact, and others are referred to some of the more recent scientific works for outside corroboration. There are the usual seven sub-divisions to this plane.


2. The Plane of Elemental Mind (A)

This comprises the state or condition, and degree of mental and vital development of a class of entities unknown to the average man, but recognized to occultists. 

They are invisible to the ordinary senses of man, but, nevertheless, exist and play their part of the Drama of the Universe. 

Their degree of intelligence is between that of the mineral and chemical entities on the one hand, and of the entities of the plant kingdom on the other. There are seven subdivisions to this plane, also.


3. The Plane of Plant Mind 

The Plane of Plant Mind, in its seven sub-divisions, comprises the states or conditions of the entities comprising the kingdoms of the Plant World, the vital and mental phenomena of which is fairly well understood by the average intelligent person, many new and interesting scientific works regarding "Mind and Life in Plants" having been published during the last decade. Plants have life, mind and "souls," as well as have the animals, man, and super-man.


4. The Plane of Elemental Mind (B) 

The Plane of Elemental Mind (B), in its seven sub-divisions, comprises the states and conditions of a higher form of "elemental" or unseen entities, playing their part in the general work of the Universe, the mind and life of which form a part of the scale between the Plane of Plant Mind and the Plane of Animal Mind, the entities partaking of the nature of both.


5. The Plane of Animal Mind 

The Plane of Animal Mind, in its seven sub-divisions, comprises the states and conditions of the entities, beings, or souls, animating the animal forms of life, familiar to us all. It is not necessary to go into details regarding this kingdom or plane of life, for the animal world is as familiar to us as is our own.

6. The Plane of Elemental Mind (C) 

The Plane of Elemental Mind (C), in its seven sub-divisions, comprises those entities or beings, invisible as are all such elemental forms, which partake of the nature of both animal and human life in a degree and in certain combinations. The highest forms are semi-human in intelligence.


7. The Plane of Human Mind


The Plane of Human Mind, in its seven sub-divisions, comprises those manifestations of life and mentality which are common to Man, in his various grades, degrees, and divisions. 

The average man of today occupies but the 4th sub-division of the Plane of Human Mind. Only the most intelligent have crossed the borders of the 5th Sub-Division. 

It has taken the race millions of years to reach this stage. It will take many more years for the race to move on to the 6th and 7th sub-divisions, and beyond. There have been races before us which have passed through these degrees, and then on to higher planes. 

Our own race is the 5th (with stragglers from the 4th) which has set foot upon The Path.

There are a few advanced souls of our own race who have outstripped the masses, and who have passed on to the sixth and seventh sub-division, and some few being still further on. 

- The man of the Sixth Sub-Division will be "The Super-Man"
- The man of the Seventh will be "The Over-Man"

In our consideration of the Seven Minor Mental Planes, we have merely referred to the Three Elementary Planes in a general way.

We do not wish to go into this subject in detail in this work, for it does not belong to this part of the general philosophy and teachings. 


## Piano 

In order to give you a little clearer idea, of the relations of these planes to the more familiar ones, we can say that the Elementary Planes bear the same relation to the Planes of Mineral, Plant, Animal and Human Mentality and Life, that the black keys on the piano do to the white keys.

The white keys are sufficient to produce music, but there are certain scales, melodies, and harmonies, in which the black keys play their part, and in which their presence is necessary. 

They are also necessary as "connecting links" of soul-condition; entity states, etc., between the several other planes, certain forms of development being attained therein—this last fact giving to the reader who can "read between the lines" a new light upon the processes of Evolution, and a new key to the secret door of the "leaps of life" between kingdom and kingdom. 

The great kingdoms of Elementals are fully recognized by all occultists, and the esoteric writings are full of mention of them. The readers of Bulwer's "Sanoni" and similar tales will recognize the entities inhabiting these planes of life.

Passing on from the Great Mental Plane to the Great Spiritual Plane, what shall we say? How can we explain these higher states of Being, Life and Mind, to minds as yet unable to grasp and understand the higher subdivisions of the Plane of Human Mind? 

The task is impossible. 

We can speak only in the most general terms. 

How may Light be described to a man born blind—how sugar, to a man who has never tasted anything sweet—how harmony, to one born deaf?

All that we can say is that the Seven Minor Planes of the Great Spiritual Plane (each Minor Plane having its seven sub-divisions) comprise Beings possessing Life, Mind and Form as far above that of Man of to-day as the latter is above the earth-worm, mineral or even certain forms of Energy or Matter. 

The Life of these Beings so far transcends ours, that we cannot even think of the details of the same; their minds so far transcend ours, that to them we scarcely seem to "think," and our mental processes seem almost akin to material processes; the Matter of which their forms are composed is of the highest Planes of Matter, nay, some are even said to be "clothed in Pure Energy." 

What may be said of such Beings?

On the Seven Minor Planes of the Great Spiritual Plane exist Beings of whom we may speak as Angels; Archangels; Demi-Gods. On the lower Minor Planes dwell those great souls whom we call Masters and Adepts. 

Above them come the Great Hierarchies of the Angelic Hosts, unthinkable to man; and above those come those who may without irreverence be called "The Gods," so high in the scale of Being are they, their being, intelligence and power being akin to those attributed by the races of men to their conceptions of Deity. 

These Beings are beyond even the highest flights of the human imagination, the word "Divine" being the only one applicable to them. Many of these Beings, as well as the Angelic Host, take the greatest interest in the affairs of the Universe and play an important part in its affairs.

These Unseen Divinities and Angelic Helpers extend their influence freely and powerfully, in the process of Evolution, and Cosmic Progress.

Their occasional intervention and assistance in human affairs have led to the many legends, beliefs, religions and traditions of the race, past and present. They have superimposed their knowledge and power upon the world, again and again, all under the Law of THE ALL, of course.

But, yet, even the highest of these advanced Beings exist merely as creations of, and in, the Mind of THE ALL, and are subject to the Cosmic Processes and Universal Laws. 

They are still Mortal. We may call them "gods" if we like, but still they are but the Elder Brethren of the Race,—the advanced souls who have outstripped their brethren, and who have foregone the ecstasy of Absorption by THE ALL, in order to help the race on its upward journey along The Path. 

But, they belong to the Universe, and are subject to its conditions—they are mortal—and their plane is below that of Absolute Spirit.

Only the most advanced Hermetists are able to grasp: 
- the Inner Teachings regarding the state of existence, and
- the powers manifested on the Spiritual Planes. 

The phenomena is so much higher than that of the Mental Planes that a confusion of ideas would surely result from an attempt to describe the same. 

Only those whose minds have been carefully trained along the lines of the Hermetic Philosophy for years—yes, those who have brought with them from other incarnations the knowledge acquired previously—can comprehend just what is meant by the Teaching regarding these Spiritual Planes.

Much of these Inner Teachings is held by the Hermetists as being too sacred, important and even dangerous for general public dissemination. 

This "Spirit" as used by the Hermetists is akin to:
- "Living Power"
- "Animated Force"
- "Inner Essence"
- "Essence of Life," etc.

 <!-- which meaning must not be confounded with that usually and commonly employed in connection with the term, i.e., "religious; ecclesiastical; spiritual; ethereal; holy," etc., etc.  -->

To occultists, the word "Spirit" is used in the sense of "The Animating Principle". It carries with it the idea of Power, Living Energy, Mystic Force, etc.

Occultists know that "Spiritual Power" may be employed for both good and evil (in accordance with the Principle of Polarity).

The majority of religions recognize this in their conceptions of Satan, Beelzebub, the Devil, Lucifer, Fallen Angels, etc.

And so the knowledge of these Planes has been kept in the Holy of Holies in all Esoteric Fraternities and Occult Orders,—in the Secret Chamber of the Temple.

Those who have attained high spiritual powers and have misused them, have a terrible fate in store for them.

The swing of the pendulum of Rhythm will inevitably swing them back to the furthest extreme of Material existence. From that point, they must retrace their steps Spiritward, along the weary rounds of The Path. But they must always do it with the added torture of always having a lingering memory of the heights from which they fell.

The legends of the Fallen Angels have a basis in actual facts, as all advanced occultists know. 

The striving for selfish power on the Spiritual Planes inevitably results in the selfish soul losing its spiritual balance and falling back as far as it had previously risen. 

But to even such a soul, the opportunity of a return is given. Such souls make the return journey, paying the terrible penalty according to the invariable Law.

<!-- In conclusion we would again remind you that according to the Principle of Correspondence, which embodies the truth: "As Above so Below; as Below, so Above," all of the Seven Hermetic Principles are in full operation on all of the many planes, Physical Mental and Spiritual.  -->

The Principle of Mental Substance applies to all the planes, for all are held in the Mind of THE ALL. 

The Principle of Correspondence manifests in all, for there is a correspondence, harmony and agreement between the several planes. 

The Principle of Vibration manifests on all planes, in fact the very differences that go to make the "planes" arise from Vibration, as we have explained. 

The Principle of Polarity manifests on each plane, the extremes of the Poles being apparently opposite and contradictory. The Principle of Rhythm manifests on each Plane, the movement of the phenomena having its ebb and flow, rise and flow, incoming and outgoing. 

The Principle of Cause and Effect manifests on each Plane, every Effect having its Cause and every Cause having its effect.

The Principle of Gender manifests on each Plane, the Creative Energy being always manifest, and operating along the lines of its Masculine and Feminine Aspects.

<!-- "As Above so Below; as Below, so Above." This centuries old Hermetic axiom embodies one of the great Principles of Universal Phenomena. As we proceed with our consideration of the remaining Principles, we will see even more clearly the truth of the universal nature of this great Principle of Correspondence. -->
