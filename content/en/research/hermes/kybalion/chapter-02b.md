## 3. The Principle of Vibration

{{< q >}}
"Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates."—The Kybalion.
{{< /q >}}


This Principle states that:
- everything is in motion
- everything vibrates
- nothing is at rest

Modern Science endorses these. 

<!-- , and which each new scientific discovery tends to verify. And yet this Hermetic Principle was enunciated thousands of years ago, by the Masters of Ancient Egypt. This Principle explains that -->

This principle says that **the differences between different manifestations of Matter, Energy, Mind, and even Spirit, result largely from varying rates of Vibration.** 

From THE ALL, as Pure Spirit, down to the grossest form of Matter, all is in vibration. The higher the vibration, the higher the position in the scale. 

The vibration of Spirit has an infinite rate of intensity and speed that it seems at rest, just as a rapidly-moving wheel seems to be motionless. 

At the other end of the scale, there are gross forms of matter whose vibrations are so low as to seem at rest. 

Between these poles, there are millions of varying degrees of vibration. From corpuscle and electron, atom and molecule, to worlds and universes, everything is in vibratory motion.

This is also true on the planes of:
- energy and force (which are but varying degrees of vibration)
- mentality (whose states depend upon vibrations)
- spirituality. 


With the appropriate formulas and the understanding of this Principle, Hermetic students can control their own mental vibrations and those of others. 

The Masters also apply this Principle to the conquering of Natural phenomena. 

<!-- "He who understands the Principle of Vibration, has grasped the scepter of power," says one of the old writers. -->


## 4. The Principle of Polarity

{{< q >}}
"Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled."—The Kybalion.
{{< /q >}}


This Principle states that:
- everything is dual
- everything has two poles
- everything has its pair of opposites

<!-- ," all of which were old Hermetic axioms. It explains the old paradoxes, that have perplexed so many, which have been stated as follows: --> 

Moreover:
- thesis and antithesis are identical in nature, but different in degree
- opposites are the same, differing only in degree
- the pairs of opposites may be reconciled
- extremes meet
- everything is and isn't, at the same time
- all truths are but half-truths
- every truth is half-false
- there are two sides to everything


This principle explains that:
- there are two poles or opposite aspects in everything
- "opposites" are really only the two extremes of the same thing, with many varying degrees between them. 

For example, Heat and Cold are "opposites" but are really the same thing. Their differences consisting merely of degrees of the same thing. Look at your thermometer and see if you can discover where "heat" ends and "cold" begins! 

There is no such thing as "absolute heat" or "absolute cold". "Heat" and "cold" are merely  varying degrees of the same thing. That "same thing" which manifests as "heat" and "cold" is merely a form, variety, and rate of Vibration. 

So "heat" and "cold" are simply the "two poles" of that which we call "Heat". This shows <!-- —and the phenomena attendant thereupon are manifestations of  -->the Principle of Polarity. 


Another example is "Light and Darkness". These are the same thing, the difference consisting of varying degrees between the two poles of the phenomena. 
- Where does "darkness" leave off, and "light" begin? 
- What is the difference between "Large and Small"? <!-- Between "Hard and Soft"? Between "Black and White"? Between "Sharp and Dull"? Between "Noise and Quiet"? Between "High and Low"?  -->

<!-- Between "Positive and Negative"?  -->

The Principle of Polarity explains these paradoxes, and no other Principle can supersede it. 

The same Principle operates on the Mental Plane. 

"Love and Hate" are 2 mental states apparently totally different. Yet there are degrees of Hate and degrees of Love. Its middle point we call "Like or Dislike". <!-- These shade into each other so gradually that sometimes we are at a loss to know whether we "like" or "dislike" or "neither." --> These are simply degrees of the same thing<!-- , as you will see if you will but think a moment -->.

<!-- More than this (and considered of more importance by the Hermetists),  -->

It is possible to change the vibrations of Hate to the vibrations of Love in one's own mind, and in the minds of others. 

We have experiences of the involuntary rapid transition from Love to Hate, and the reverse.

This can be done by <!--  And you will therefore realize the possibility of this being accomplished by the use of --> the Will, through the Hermetic formulas. "Good and Evil" are but the poles of the same thing. The Hermetist can transmute Evil into Good by using the Principle of Polarity. 

In short, the "Art of Polarization" becomes a phase of "Mental Alchemy". <!--  known and practiced by the ancient and modern Hermetic Masters. --> An understanding of the Principle will enable one to change his own Polarity, and those ofothers, if he will devote the time and study to master the art.
