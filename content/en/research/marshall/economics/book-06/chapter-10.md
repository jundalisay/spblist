§ 1. In early times, and in some backward countries even in our own age, all rights to
property depend on general understandings rather than on precise laws and
documents. In so far as these understandings can be reduced to definite terms and
expressed in the language of modern business, they are generally to the following
effect:—The ownership of land is vested, not in an individual, but in a firm of which
one member or group of members is the sleeping partner, while another member or
group of members (it may be a whole family) is the working partner104 .
The sleeping partner is sometimes the ruler of the State, sometimes he is an individual
who inherits what was once the duty of collecting the payments due to this ruler from
the cultivators of a certain part of the soil; but what, in the course of silent time, has
become a right of ownership, more or less definite, more or less absolute. If, as is
generally the case, he retains the duty to make certain payments to the ruler of the
State, the partnership may be regarded as containing three members, of whom two are
sleeping partners105 .

The sleeping partner, or one of them, is generally called the proprietor, or landholder
or landlord, or even the landowner. But this is an incorrect way of speaking, when he
is restrained by law, or by custom which has nearly the force of law, from turning the
cultivator out of the holding by an arbitrary increase of the payments exacted from
him or by any other means. In that case the property in the land vests not in him alone,
but in the whole of the firm of which he is only the sleeping partner, the payment
made by the working partner is not a rent at all, but is that fixed sum, or that part of
the gross proceeds, as the case may be, which the constitution of the firm binds him to
pay; and, in so far as the custom or law which regulates these payments is fixed and
unalterable, the theory of rent has but little direct application.
§ 2. But in fact the payments and dues, which custom is supposed to stereotype,
nearly always contain elements which are incapable of precise definition; while the
accounts of them handed down by tradition are embodied in loose and vague
impressions, or at best are expressed in words that make no attempt at scientific
exactness106 .
We can watch the influence of this vagueness in the agreements between landlord and
tenant even in modern England; for they have always been interpreted by the aid of
customs, which have ever been imperceptibly growing and dwindling again, to meet
the changing exigencies of successive generations. We change our customs more
quickly than our forefathers did, and we are more conscious of our changes and more
willing to convert our customs into legal enactments, and to make them uniform107 .

At the present day, in spite of minute legislation and carefully drawn agreements,
there remains a wide margin of uncertainty as to the amount of capital which the
landlord will from time to time invest in maintaining and extending the farm buildings
and other improvements. It is in these matters, quite as much as in his direct money
relations with the tenant, that the generous and liberal landlord shows himself; and,
what is specially important for the general argument of this chapter, alterations in the
real net rent required of the tenant are as often made by a quiet readjustment of the
shares of the expenses of working the farm that are borne by the landlord and the
tenant as by a change in the money rent. Thus corporate bodies and many large
private landowners often let their tenants go on from year to year, without any attempt
to make the money rents follow the changes in the real letting value of the land; and
there are many farms which are not let on lease and yet the rent of which has
nominally remained unchanged during the agricultural inflation which culminated in
1874, and during the depression which followed. But in the earlier period the farmer,
who knew he was under-rented, could not put pressure on his landlord to lay out
capital in drainage or new buildings or even in repairs, and had to humour him as
regards the game and in other matters; while just now the landlord, who has a steady
tenant, will do many things, that are not stipulated for in the agreement, in order to
retain him. Thus, while the money rent has remained stationary, the real rent has
changed.
This fact is an important illustration of the general proposition, that the economic
theory of rent, the Ricardian theory as it is sometimes called, does not apply to
modern English land tenure without many corrections and limitations both as regards
substance and form; and that a further extension of these corrections and limitations
will make the theory applicable to all forms of Mediæval and Oriental land tenure, in
which any sort of private ownership is recognized. The difference is only one of
degree.
§ 3. But the difference of degree is very great. This is partly because in primitive
times and backward countries the sway of custom is more undisputed; partly because,
in the absence of scientific history, shortlived man has little better means of
ascertaining whether custom is quietly changing, than the fly, born to-day and dead
to-morrow, has of watching the growth of the plant on which it rests. But the chief
reason is that the conditions of partnership were expressed in terms which were
seldom capable of exact definition and measurement.
For the share of the senior partner in the firm, or the landlord as we may for shortness
call him, generally included (either with or without a right to a certain share of the
produce) the right to claim certain labour services and dues, tolls and presents; and the
amount which he obtained under each of those heads varied from time to time, from
place to place, and from one landlord to another. Whenever payments of all kinds
made by the cultivator left him a margin beyond the necessaries of life for him and his
family, together with those comforts and luxuries which were established by custom,
the landlord was likely to use his superior strength to raise the payments in some form
or other. If the chief payments were a certain share of the produce, he might increase
that share: but, as that could seldom be done without an appearance of violence, he
would be more likely to increase the number and weight of his minor imposts, or to
PLL v6.0 (generated September, 2011)
369
http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/1676Online Library of Liberty: Principles of Economics (8th ed.)
insist that the land be more intensively cultivated, and a larger part of it be given to
crops that cost much labour and are of great value. Thus changes went on, smoothly
for the most part, silently and almost imperceptibly, like the hour-hand of a clock; but
in the long run they were very thorough108 .
The protection which custom afforded to the tenant was not indeed unimportant even
as regards these dues. For he always knew pretty well what demands he would have to
meet at any particular time. The moral sense of all around him, high and low,
protested against any attempt on the part of his landlord to make a sudden and violent
increase in the payments and dues, the tolls and fines which were recognized as usual;
and thus custom rounded off the edges of change.
It is moreover true that these vague and variable elements of rent were generally but a
small part of the whole; and that in those not very rare cases in which the money rent
remained fixed for very long periods together, the tenant had a kind of partnership in
the soil, which he owed partly to the forbearance of his landlord if it happened that the
true net value of the land had risen, but partly also to the constraining force of custom
and public opinion. This force in some measure resembled the force which holds
raindrops on the lower edge of a window frame: the repose is complete till the
window is violently shaken, and then they fall together; and in like way the legal
rights of the landlord which had long lain latent were sometimes brought suddenly
into action in a period of great economic change109 .
§ 4. The question whether the payments made by the cultivator for the use of his land
should be reckoned in money or in produce is of growing interest with reference to
both India and England. But we may pass it by for the present and consider the more
fundamental distinction between the "English" system of rental and that of holding
land on "shares," as it is called in the New World, or the "Metayer110 " system as it is
called in the Old.
In a great part of Latin Europe the land is divided into holdings, which the tenant
cultivates by the labour of himself and his family, and sometimes, though rarely, that
of a few hired labourers, and for which the landlord supplies buildings, cattle and,
sometimes even, farm implements. In America there are few agricultural tenancies of
any kind, but two-thirds of those few are small holdings let out to white men of the
poorer class, or to freed negroes, on some plan by which labour and capital share in
the produce111 .
This plan enables a man who has next to no capital of his own to obtain the use of it at
a lower charge than he could in any other way, and to have more freedom and
responsibility than he would as a hired labourer; and thus the plan has many of the
advantages of the three modern systems of co-operation, profit sharing, and payment
by piece-work112 . But though the metayer has more freedom than the hired labourer
he has less than the English farmer. His landlord has to spend much time and trouble,
either of his own or of a paid agent, in keeping the tenant to his work; and he must
charge for these a large sum, which, though going by another name, is really earnings
of management. For, when the cultivator has to give to his landlord half of the returns
to each dose of capital and labour that he applies to the land, it will not be to his
PLL v6.0 (generated September, 2011)
370
http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/1676Online Library of Liberty: Principles of Economics (8th ed.)
interest to apply any doses the total return to which is less than twice enough to
reward him. If, then, he is free to cultivate as he chooses, he will cultivate far less
intensively than on the English plan; he will apply only so much capital and labour as
will give him returns more than twice enough to repay himself: so that his landlord
will get a smaller share even of those returns than he would have on the plan of a
fixed payment113 .
This is the case in many parts of Europe, in which the tenant has practical fixity of
tenure; and then it is only by constant interference that the landlord can keep up the
amount of labour he puts on his farm, and keep down the use he makes of the farm
cattle for outside work, the fruits of which he does not share with his landlord.
But even in the most stationary districts the amount and quality of the stock which
custom requires the landlord to provide are being constantly, though imperceptibly,
modified to suit the changing relations of demand and supply. And if the tenant has no
fixity of tenure, the landlord can deliberately and freely arrange the amount of capital
and labour supplied by the tenant and the amount of capital supplied by himself to suit
the exigencies of each special case114 .
It is obvious then that the advantages of the metayer system are considerable when the
holdings are very small, the tenants poor, and the landlords not averse to taking much
trouble about small things: but that it is not suitable for holdings large enough to give
scope to the enterprise of an able and responsible tenant. It is commonly associated
with the system of peasant proprietorship; and we may consider that next.
§ 5. The position of a peasant proprietor has great attractions. He is free to do what he
likes, he is not worried by the interference of a landlord, and the anxiety lest another
should reap the fruits of his work and self-denial. His feeling of ownership gives him
self-respect, and stability of character, and makes him provident and temperate in his
habits. He is scarcely ever idle, and seldom regards his work as mere drudgery; it is
all for the land that he loves so well.
"The magic of property turns sand into gold," said Arthur Young. It undoubtedly has
done so in many cases in which the proprietors have been men of exceptional energy.
But such men might perhaps have done as well or better if their horizon had not been
limited to the narrow hopes of a peasant proprietor. For indeed there is another side to
the picture. "Land," we are told, "is the best savings-bank for the working man."
Sometimes it is the second best. But the very best is the energy of himself and his
children; and the peasant proprietors are so intent on their land that they often care for
little else. Many even of the richest of them stint the food of themselves and their
families: they pride themselves on the respectability of their houses and furniture; but
they live in their kitchens for economy, and are practically worse housed and far
worse fed than the better class of English cottagers. And the poorest of them work
hard during very long hours; but they do not get through much work, because they
feed themselves worse than the poorest English labourers. They do not understand
that wealth is useful only as the means towards a real income of happiness; they
sacrifice the end to the means115 .

And it must be recollected that the English labourers represent the failure rather than
the success of the English system. They are the descendants of those who for many
successive generations have not availed themselves of the opportunities by which
their abler and more adventurous neighbours were rising to leading posts at home,
and, what is far more important, were acquiring the fee simple of a great part of the
surface of the globe. Of the causes which have contributed to make the English race
the chief owners of the New World, the most important is that bold enterprise which
has made a man, who is rich enough to be a peasant proprietor, generally refuse to be
content with the humdrum life and the narrow income of a peasant. And among the
causes which have fostered this enterprise, none is more important than the absence of
the temptations to wait about for a petty inheritance, and to marry for the sake of
property rather than in the free exercise of individual choice—temptations which have
often dulled the energy of youth in places in which peasant properties have
predominated.
It is partly in consequence of the absence of these temptations that the "farmers" of
America, though they are men of the working class cultivating their own land with
their own hands, do not resemble "peasant proprietors." They invest their income
freely and wisely in developing the energies of themselves and their children; and
these energies constitute the chief part of their capital, for their land generally is as yet
of but little value. Their minds are always active, and though many of them have little
technical knowledge of agriculture, their acuteness and versatility enable them to find
out almost unerringly the best solution of the problem immediately before them.
That problem is generally to obtain a produce large in proportion to the labour spent
on it, though small in proportion to the abundant land at their disposal. In some parts
of America, however, in which land is beginning to get a scarcity value, and in which
the immediate neighbourhood of good markets is making an intensive cultivation
profitable, the methods of farming and of tenure are rearranging themselves on the
English model. And within the last few years there have been signs of a tendency on
the part of native Americans to hand over to persons of recent European origin the
farms of the West, as they have already done the farms of the East, and as they did
long ago the textile industries.
§ 6. Let us then turn to that English system of tenure. It is faulty and harsh in many
respects; but it stimulated and economized the enterprise and energy, which, aided by
England's geographical advantages and freedom from devastating wars, gave her the
leadership of the world in the arts of manufacture and colonization and, though in a
less marked degree, in agriculture. England has learnt lessons in agriculture from
many countries and especially the Netherlands; but on the whole she has taught far
more than she has learnt. And there is now no country except the Netherlands which
can compare with her in the amount of produce per acre of fertile land; and no country
in Europe which obtains nearly so high returns in proportion to the labour expended in
getting them116 .
The chief merit of the system is that it enables the landlord to keep in his own hands
the responsibility for that part and only that part of the property which he can look
after with but little trouble to himself, and little vexation to his tenant; and the
PLL v6.0 (generated September, 2011)
372
http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/1676Online Library of Liberty: Principles of Economics (8th ed.)
investment of which, though requiring both enterprise and judgment, does not demand
constant supervision of minor details. His part consists of land, buildings and
permanent improvements, and averages in England five times that which the farmer
has to supply himself; and he is willing to supply his part in the enterprise with this
great capital at a net rent which seldom gives interest at as much as three per cent. on
its cost. There is no other business in which a man can borrow what capital he wants
at so low a rate, or can often borrow so large a part of his capital at any rate at all. The
metayer indeed may be said to borrow an even larger share, but at a much higher
rate117 .
The second merit of the English system, which partly follows from the first, is that it
gives the landlord considerable freedom in the selection of an able and responsible
tenant. So far as the management of land, as opposed to its ownership, goes, the
accident of birth counts for less in England than in any other country of Europe. But
we have already seen that even in modern England the accident of birth counts for a
good deal in the access to posts of command in all kinds of business, to the learned
professions and even to skilled manual trades. And it counts for somewhat more in
English agriculture: for the good and bad qualities of landlords combine to prevent
their selecting tenants on strictly commercial principles, and they do not very often go
far afield for a new tenant118 .
§ 7. The number of people who have the opportunity of making a step forward in the
arts of agriculture is very great. And since the different branches of agriculture differ
from one another in general character less than do those of manufacture, it might have
been expected that new ideas in it would have followed one another quickly and have
been speedily diffused. But on the contrary progress has been slow. For the most
enterprising agriculturists drift towards the town; those who stay behind live more or
less isolated lives; and, as a result of natural selection and education, their minds have
always been more staid than those of townsmen, and less ready to suggest or even to
follow new paths. And further, though a manufacturer is nearly always safe in
copying a plan that has worked well with his neighbour in the same trade, a farmer is
not: for every farm has slight peculiarities of its own, so that the blind adoption of a
plan, that has worked well close by, is likely to fail; and its failure encourages others
in the belief that old and tried ways are the best.
Again, the variety in agricultural detail makes the proper keeping of farming accounts
very difficult. There are so many joint products and so many by-products, so many
complex and shifting relations of debtor and creditor between the several crops and
methods of feeding, that an ordinary farmer, even if he were as fond of accounts as he
is in fact averse to them, would have great difficulty in ascertaining, otherwise than by
a semi-instinctive guess, what is the price that will just pay him to raise a certain
amount of extra produce. He may know its prime cost with fair certainty, but he
seldom knows its true total cost; and this increases the difficulty of reading quickly
the teachings of experience and making progress by their aid119 .
And there is another difference between the mode of action of competition in
agriculture and in manufacture. If one manufacturer is unenterprising, others may be
able to step into the opening which he leaves vacant: but when one landowner does
PLL v6.0 (generated September, 2011)
373
http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/1676Online Library of Liberty: Principles of Economics (8th ed.)
not develop the resources of his land in the best way, others cannot make up for the
deficiency without calling into play the tendency to diminishing return; so that his
want of wisdom and enterprise makes the (marginal) supply price a little higher than it
otherwise would be120 . It is however true that the difference between the two cases
is only one of degree; since the growth of any branch of manufacture may be retarded
perceptibly by any falling-off in the ability and enterprise of the leading firms
engaged in it. The chief agricultural improvements have been made by landlords who
have themselves been townsmen or at least have associated a good deal with
townsmen, and by manufacturers in trades subsidiary to agriculture121 .
§ 8. Though nature yields generally a less than proportionate return to an increased
amount of labour of a given efficiency; man's part conforms generally to the law of
increasing return (i.e. it increases in aggregate efficiency more than in proportion to
the number of workers), in agriculture as well as in manufacture122 . But yet the
economies of production on a large scale are not quite similar in the two cases.
Firstly, agriculture must be spread over the broad land: raw material can be brought to
the manufacturer for him to work on; but the agriculturist must seek his work. Again,
the workers on the land must adapt their work to the seasons, and can seldom confine
themselves entirely to one class of work; and in consequence agriculture, even under
the English system, cannot move fast in the direction of the methods of manufacture.
But yet there are considerable forces tending to push it in that direction. The progress
of invention is constantly increasing the number of serviceable, but expensive
machines, for most of which a small farmer can find employment during only a very
short time. He may hire some of them; but there are many the use of which he can get
only by cooperation with his neighbours; and the uncertainties of the weather prevent
this plan from working very smoothly in practice123 .
Again, the farmer must go beyond the results of his own and his father's experience in
order to keep abreast of the changes of the day. He should be able to follow the
movements of agricultural science and practice closely enough to see their chief
practical applications to his own farm. To do all this properly requires a trained and
versatile mind; and a farmer who has these qualities could find time to direct the
general course of the management of several hundred, or even of several thousand
acres; and the mere superintendence of his men's work in matters of detail is not a
task fitting for him. The work which he ought to do is as difficult as that of a large
manufacturer, who would not spend his own strength on minute supervision which he
can easily hire subordinates to do. A farmer, who can do this higher work, must be
wasting his strength on work that is beneath him, unless he employs many gangs of
workmen each of them under a responsible foreman. But there are not many farms
which give scope for this, and there is therefore very little inducement for really able
men to enter the business of farming; the best enterprise and ability of the country
generally avoid agriculture and go to trades in which there is room for a man of first-
rate ability to do nothing but high class work, to do a great deal of it, and therefore to
get high earnings of management124 .
PLL v6.0 (generated September, 2011)
374
http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/1676Online Library of Liberty: Principles of Economics (8th ed.)
If it be assumed, as is the modern fashion, that the farmer is not to work habitually
with his men and to encourage them by his presence, it seems best for the economy of
production that farms should be as large as is practicable under the existing conditions
of land tenure; so as to give room for the use of highly specialized machines and for
the exercise of great ability on the part of the farmer. But if a farm is not very large,
and if, as is often the case, the farmer has no greater ability and activity of mind than
is commonly to be found among the better class of working foremen in manufactures;
then it would be best for others, and in the long run for himself, that he should return
to the old plan of working among his men. Perhaps also his wife might return to some
of those lighter tasks in and near the farmhouse which tradition ascribes to her. They
require discretion and judgment, they are not inconsistent with education and culture;
and combined with it they would raise and not lower the tone of her life, and her real
claims to a good social position. There is some reason for thinking that the stern
action of the principle of natural selection is now displacing those farmers, who have
not the faculty to do difficult head-work, and yet decline to do hand-work. Their
places are being taken by men of more than average natural ability who, with the help
of modern education, are rising from the ranks of labourers; who are quite able to
manage the ordinary routine work of a model farm; and who are giving to it a new life
and spirit by calling their men to come and work, instead of telling them to go and
work. Very large farms being left out of view, it is with rather small farms worked on
these principles that the immediate future of English agriculture seems to lie. Small
holdings have great advantages wherever so much care has to be given to individual
plants, that machinery is out of place. But modern applications of scientific methods
are giving an increasing importance to that economy of technical skill which can be
attained in a large nursery for choice flowers and fruits, with several highly paid
assistants.
§ 9. We may next consider how far landlords will in their own interest adjust the size
of holdings to the real needs of the people. Small holdings often require more
expensive buildings, roads and fences, and involve greater trouble and incidental
expenses of management to the landlord in proportion to their acreage than do large
holdings; and while a large farmer who has some rich land can turn poor soils to good
account, small holdings will not flourish generally except on good soil125 . Their
gross rental per acre must therefore always be at a higher rate than that of large farms.
But it is contended that, especially when land is heavily burdened by settlements,
landlords are unwilling to incur the expense of subdividing farms, unless they see
their way to rents for small holdings that will give them, in addition to high profits on
their outlay, a heavy insurance fund against the chance of having to throw the
holdings together again; and that the rental for small holdings, and especially for those
of only a few acres, is extravagantly high in many parts of the country. Sometimes the
prejudices of the landlord and his desire for undisputed authority make him positively
refuse to sell or let land to persons who are not in harmony with him on social,
political or religious questions. It seems certain that evils of this kind have always
been confined to a few districts, and that they are rapidly diminishing, but they rightly
attract much attention; for there is a public need in every district for small holdings, as
well as large; for allotments and large gardens; and generally for holdings so small
that they can be worked by people who have some other occupation126 .

http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/1676Online Library of Liberty: Principles of Economics (8th ed.)
And lastly though peasant proprietorship, as a system, is unsuited to the economic
conditions of England, to her soil, her climate, and the temper of her people, yet there
are a few peasant proprietors in England who are perfectly happy in this condition;
and there are a few others who would buy small plots of land and would live happily
on them, if they could get just what they wanted where they wanted it. Their temper is
such that they do not mind working hard and living sparely, provided they need call
no one master; they love quiet and dislike excitement; and they have a great capacity
for growing fond of land. Reasonable opportunity should be given to such people to
invest their savings in small plots of land, on which they may raise suitable crops with
their own hands; and at the very least the present grievous legal charges on the
transfer of small plots should be diminished.
Co-operation might seem likely to flourish in agriculture and to combine the
economies of production on a large scale with many of the joys and the social gains of
small properties. It requires habits of mutual trust and confidence; and unfortunately
the bravest and the boldest, and therefore the most trustful, of the countrymen have
always moved to the towns, and agriculturists are a suspicious race. But Denmark,
Italy, Germany, and lastly Ireland have led the way in a movement which seems full
of promise for organized co-operation in the handling of dairy produce, in the making
of butter and cheese; in buying farmers' requisites and in selling farmers' produce: and
Britain is following in their wake. The movement is however of limited scope: it
scarcely touches work in the field itself.
As co-operation might combine more of the advantages of all systems of tenure, so
the cottier system of Ireland often combined the disadvantages of all; but its worst
evils and their causes have almost disappeared and the economic elements of the
problem are just now overshadowed by the political. We must therefore pass it by127
.
§ 10. The failures of the English system of land tenure in Ireland have brought into
clear relief difficulties which are inherent in it, but which have been kept in the
background in England by the conformity of the system to the business habits and the
character of the people. The chief of these difficulties arise from the fact that while
the system is competitive in its essence, the conditions of agriculture even in England
offer a strong resistance to the full action of free competition. To begin with, there are
special difficulties in ascertaining the facts on which that action must be based. We
have just noticed the difficulty of keeping exact farming accounts: to this must be
added that a farmer's calculations as to the rent which it is worth his while to
undertake to pay, are further hampered by the difficulty of deciding what is a normal
harvest and a normal level of prices. For good and bad seasons come so much in
cycles that many years are required to afford a trustworthy average of them128 : and
in those many years the industrial environment is likely to have changed much; the
local demand, the facilities for selling his own produce in distant markets and those
which assist competitors from a distance to sell their produce in his local markets may
all have changed.
The landlord in determining what rent to accept is met by this difficulty and also by
another, arising out of variations in the standards of ability among farmers in different
PLL v6.0 (generated September, 2011)
376
http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/1676Online Library of Liberty: Principles of Economics (8th ed.)
parts of the country. The producer's surplus, or English rent, of a farm is that excess
which its produce yields over its expenses of cultivation, including normal profits to
the farmer: it being assumed that that farmer's ability and enterprise are such as are
normal for farms of that class in that place. The difficulty in view is to decide whether
these last words are to be interpreted broadly or narrowly.
It is clear that if a farmer falls below the standard of ability of his own district, if his
only forte is in driving hard bargains, if his gross produce is small and his net produce
even smaller in proportion; in such a case the landlord acts in the interest of all when
he hands over the farm to a more competent tenant, who will pay better wages, obtain
a much higher net produce and pay a somewhat higher rent. On the other hand, when
the local standard of normal ability and enterprise is low, it is not clearly right from an
ethical point of view, nor is it clearly in the business interests of the landlord in the
long run, that he should endeavour to take to himself a greater rent than can be paid
by a farmer who reaches that standard; even though it could be obtained by importing
a farmer from another district in which the standard is higher129 .
Closely related to this question is one as to the freedom the tenant should have to
develop the natural capabilities of his land at his own risk, with the understanding that
if he is successful he is to retain something more than mere normal profits on his
enterprise. So far as minor improvements go, this difficulty is in a great measure met
by long leases. These have done much for Scotland: but they have disadvantages of
their own. And as has been often observed, "the English tenant has always something
of a lease even when he has no lease": and again, "there are traces of métayage even
in tenures which are thoroughly English." When seasons and markets are favourable
to the farmer, he pays his full rent and avoids making demands on the landlord that
might set him thinking whether the rent ought not to be raised. When things go badly,
the landlord, partly from sympathy and partly as a matter of business, makes
temporary remissions of rent, and bears the expense of repairs, etc., which he would
otherwise have left for the farmer. There may thus be much give and take between
landlord and tenant without any change of nominal rent130 .
Custom has always given to the English tenant some partial security for compensation
for improvements made by him; and legislation has recently caught up custom, and
even passed it. The tenant is now practically secure against the raising of his rent on
account of increased yield of the soil due to improvements of a reasonable nature
made by himself: and on leaving he can claim compensation for the unexhausted
value of them, to be fixed by arbitration131 .
Finally a word may be said as to private and public interests with regard to open
spaces in towns. Wakefield and the American economists have taught us how a
sparsely inhabited new district is enriched by the advent of every new settler. The
