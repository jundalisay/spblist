§ 1. The field of employment which any place offers for labour and capital depends,
firstly, on its natural resources; secondly, on the power of turning them to good
account, derived from its progress of knowledge and of social and industrial
organization; and thirdly, on the access that it has to markets in which it can sell those
things of which it has a superfluity. The importance of this last condition is often
underrated; but it stands out prominently when we look at the history of new
countries.

It is commonly said that wherever there is abundance of good land to be had free of
rent, and the climate is not unhealthy, the real earnings of labour and the interest on
capital must both be high. But this is only partially true. The early colonists of
America lived very hardly. Nature gave them wood and meat almost free: but they
had very few of the comforts and luxuries of life. 

And even now there are, especially
in South America and Africa, many places to which nature has been abundantly
generous, which are nevertheless shunned by labour and capital, because they have no
ready communications with the rest of the world. On the other hand high rewards may
be offered to capital and labour by a mining district in the midst of an alkaline desert,
when once communications have been opened up with the outer world, or again by a
trading centre on a barren sea-coast; though, if limited to their own resources, they
could support but a scanty population, and that in abject poverty. And the splendid
markets which the old world has offered to the products of the new, since the growth
of steam communication, have rendered North America, Australia and parts of Africa
and South America, the richest large fields for the employment of capital and labour
that there have ever been.

But after all the chief cause of the modern prosperity of new countries lies in the
markets that the old world offers, not for goods delivered on the spot, but for promises
to deliver goods at a distant date. A handful of colonists having assumed rights of
perpetual property in vast tracts of rich land, are anxious to reap in their own
generation its future fruits; and as they cannot do this directly, they do it indirectly, by
selling in return for the ready goods of the old world promises to pay much larger
quantities of the goods that their own soil will produce in a future generation. In one
form or another they mortgage their new property to the old world at a very high rate
of interest. Englishmen and others, who have accumulated the means of present
enjoyment, hasten to barter them for larger promises in the future than they can get at
home: a vast stream of capital flows to the new country, and its arrival there raises the
rate of wages very high. The new capital filters but slowly towards the outlying
districts: it is so scarce there, and there are so many persons eager to have it, that it
often commands for a long time two per cent. a month, from which it falls by gradual
stages down to six, or perhaps even five per cent., a year. For the settlers being full of
enterprise, and seeing their way to acquiring private title-deeds to property that will shortly be of great value, are eager to become independent undertakers, and if
possible employers of others; so wage-earners have to be attracted by high wages,
which are paid in a great measure out of the commodities borrowed from the old
world on mortgages, or in other ways.

It is, however, difficult to estimate exactly the real rate of wages in outlying parts of
new countries. The workers are picked men with a natural bias towards adventure;
hardy, resolute, and enterprising; men in the prime of life, who do not know what
illness is; and the strain of one kind and another which they go through, is more than
the average English, and much more than the average European labourer could
sustain. There are no poor among them, because there are none who are weak: if
anyone becomes ailing, he is forced to retire to some more thickly-peopled place
where there is less to be earned, but where also a quieter and less straining life is
possible. Their earnings are very high if reckoned in money; but they have to buy at
very high prices, or altogether dispense with, many of the comforts and luxuries
which they would have obtained freely, or at low prices, if they had lived in more
settled places. Many of these things however meet only artificial wants; and they can
be easily foregone, where no one has them and no one expects them.

As population increases, the best situations being already occupied, nature gives
generally less return of raw produce to the marginal effort of the cultivators; and this
tends a little to lower wages. But even in agriculture the law of increasing return is
constantly contending with that of diminishing return, and many of the lands which
were neglected at first give a generous response to careful cultivation; and meanwhile
the development of roads and railroads, and the growth of varied markets and varied
industries, render possible innumerable economies in production. Thus the tendencies
to increasing and diminishing return appear pretty well balanced, sometimes the one,
sometimes the other being the stronger.

If labour and capital increase at equal rates; and if, taking one thing with another, the
law of production is that of constant return, there will be no change in the reward to
be divided between a dose of capital and labour; that is, between capital and labour
working together in the same proportions as before; there need not therefore be any
change in wages or interest.

If however capital increases much faster than labour, the rate of interest is likely to
fall; and then the rate of wages will probably rise at the expense of the share of a
given quantum of capital. But yet the aggregate share of capital may increase faster
than the aggregate share of labour139 .

But whether the law of production of commodities be one of constant return or not,
that of the production of new title-deeds to land is one of rapidly diminishing return.
The influx of foreign capital, though perhaps as great as ever, becomes less in
proportion to the population; wages are no longer paid largely with commodities
borrowed from the old world: and this is the chief reason of the subsequent fall in the
necessaries, comforts and luxuries of life which can be earned by work of a given
efficiency. But two other causes tend to lower average daily wages measured in
money. For, as the comforts and luxuries of civilization increase, the average efficiency of labour is generally lowered by the influx of immigrants of a less sturdy
character than the earlier settlers: and many of these new comforts and luxuries do not
enter directly into money wages, but are an addition to it140 .

§ 2. England's present economic condition is the direct result of tendencies to
production on a large scale, and to wholesale dealings in labour as well as in goods
which had long been slowly growing; but which in the eighteenth century received a
twofold impetus from mechanical inventions, and the growth of consumers beyond
the seas, who imported large quantities of goods of the same pattern. Then were the
first beginnings of machine made interchangeable parts, and the application of special
machinery to make special machinery for use in every branch of industry. Then first
was seen the full force which the law of increasing return gives in a manufacturing
country with localized industries and large capitals; particularly when many of the
large stocks of capital are combined together either into Joint-stock or Regulated
companies, or into modern Trusts. And then began that careful "grading" of goods for
sale in distant markets, which has already led to national and even international
speculative combinations in produce markets and stock-exchanges; and the future of
which, no less than that of more lasting combinations among producers, whether
undertakers of industry or working men, is the source of some of the gravest practical
problems with which the coming generation will have to deal.

The key-notes of the modern movement are the reduction of a great number of tasks
to one pattern; the diminution of friction of every kind which might hinder powerful
agencies from combining their action and spreading their influence over vast areas;
and the development of transport by new methods and new forces. The macadamized
roads and the improved shipping of the eighteenth century broke up local
combinations and monopolies, and offered facilities for the growth of others
extending over a wider area: and in our own age the same double tendency is resulting
from every new extension and cheapening of communication by land and sea, by
printing-press and telegraph and telephone.

§ 3. But though in the eighteenth century, as now, the real national dividend of
England depended much on the action of the law of increasing return with regard to
her exports, the mode of dependence has very much changed. Then England had
something approaching to a monopoly of the new methods of manufacture; and each
bale of her goods would be sold—at all events when their supply was artificially
limited—in return for a vast amount of the produce of foreign countries. But, partly
because the time was not yet ripe for carrying bulky goods great distances, her
imports from the far-east and the far-west consisted chiefly of comforts and luxuries
for the well-to-do; they had but little direct effect in lowering the labour-cost of
necessaries to the English workman. Indirectly indeed her new trade lowered the cost
of hardware, clothing and such other English manufactures as he consumed; because
the production on a large scale of these things for consumers beyond the sea
cheapened them for him. But it had very little effect on the cost of his food; and that
was left to rise under the tendency to diminishing return, which was called into action
by the rapid increase of population in new manufacturing districts where the old
customary restraints of a narrow village life did not exist. A little later the great French war, and a series of bad harvests, raised that cost to much the highest point it
has ever reached in Europe.

But gradually the influence of foreign trade began to tell on the cost of production of
our staple food. As the population of America spread westward from the Atlantic,
richer and still richer wheat soils have come under cultivation; and the economies of
transport have increased so much, especially in recent years, that the total cost of
importing a quarter of wheat from the farms on the outskirts of cultivation has
diminished rapidly, though the distance of that margin has been increasing.

And thus
England has been saved from the need of more and more intensive cultivation. The
bleak hill-sides, up which the wheat-fields were laboriously climbing in Ricardo's
time, have returned to pasture; and the ploughman works now only where land will
yield plentiful returns to his labour: whereas if England had been limited to her own
resources, he must have plodded over ever poorer and poorer soils, and must have
gone on continually reploughing land that had already been well ploughed, in the
hope of adding by this heavy toil an extra bushel or two to the produce of each acre.
Perhaps in an average year now, the ploughing which only just pays its expenses, the
ploughing "on the margin of cultivation," gives twice as much produce as it gave in
Ricardo's time, and fully five times as much as it would have given now if with her
present population England had been compelled to raise all her own food.

§ 4. Every improvement in the manufacturing arts increased England's power of
meeting the various wants of backward countries; so that it answered their purpose to
divert their energies from making things by hand for their own use, to growing raw
material with which to buy manufactures from her. In this way the progress of
invention opened a wider field for the sale of her special products, and enabled her
more and more to confine her own production of food to conditions under which the
law of diminishing return did not make itself much felt. But this good fortune has
been short-lived. Her improvements have been followed, and latterly often
anticipated, by America and Germany and other countries: and her special products
have lost nearly all their monopoly value. Thus the amount of food and other raw
material which can be bought in America with a ton of steel cannot be more than the
produce of as much capital and labour as would make a ton of steel there by the new
processes; and therefore it has fallen as the efficiency of English and American labour
in making steel has increased. It is for this reason, as well as because of the heavy
tariffs levied on her goods by many countries, that in spite of England's large trade,
the progress of invention in the manufacturing arts has added less than might have
been otherwise expected to her real national dividend.

It is no slight gain that she can make cheaply clothes and furniture and other
commodities for her own use: but those improvements in the arts of manufacture
which she has shared with other nations, have not directly increased the amount of
raw produce which she can obtain from other countries with the product of a given
quantity of her own capital and labour. Probably more than three-fourths of the whole
benefit she has derived from the progress of manufactures during the nineteenth
century has been through its indirect influences in lowering the cost of transport of
men and goods, of water and light, of electricity and news: for the dominant economic
fact of our own age is the development not of the manufacturing, but of the transport industries. It is these that are growing most rapidly in aggregate volume and in
individual power, and which are giving rise to the most anxious questions as to the
tendencies of large capitals to turn the forces of economic freedom to the destruction
of that freedom: but, on the other hand, it is they also which have done by far the most
towards increasing England's wealth.

§ 5. Thus the new economic age has brought with it great changes in the relative
values of labour and the chief requisites of life; and many of these changes are of a
character which could not have been anticipated at the beginning of last century. The
America then known was ill-suited for growing wheat; and the cost of carrying it
great distances by land was prohibitive. The labour value of wheat—that is the
amount of labour which will purchase a peck of wheat—was then at its highest point,
and now is at its lowest. It would appear that agricultural wages have been generally
below a peck of wheat a day; but that in the first half of the eighteenth century they
were about a peck, in the fifteenth a peck and a half or perhaps a little more, while
now they are two or three pecks. Prof. Rogers's estimates for the middle ages are
higher: but he seems to have taken the wages of the more favoured part of the
population as representative of the whole. In the middle ages, even after a fairly good
harvest, the wheat was of a lower quality than the ordinary wheat of to-day; while
after a bad harvest much of it was so musty that now-a-days it would not be eaten at
all; and the wheat seldom became bread without paying a high monopoly charge to
the mill belonging to the lord of the manor.

It is true that, where population is very sparse, nature supplies grass and therefore
animal food almost gratis; and in South America beggars pursue their calling on
horseback. During the middle ages however the population of England was always
dense enough to give a considerable labour value to meat, though it was of poor
quality. For cattle, though only about a fifth as heavy as now, had very large frames:
their flesh was chiefly in those parts from which the coarsest joints come; and since
they were nearly starved in the winter and fed up quickly on the summer grass, the
meat contained a large percentage of water, and lost a great part of its weight in
cooking. At the end of the summer they were slaughtered and salted: and salt was
dear. Even the well-to-do scarcely tasted fresh meat during the winter. A century ago
very little meat was eaten by the working classes; while now, though its price is a
little higher than it was then, they probably consume more of it, on the average, than
at any other time in English history.

Turning next to the rent of house-room, we find that ground-rents in town have risen,
both extensively and intensively. For an increasing part of the population is living in
houses on which ground-rents at an urban scale have to be paid, and that scale is
rising. But house rent proper, that is what remains of the total rent after deducting the
full rental value of the ground, is probably little, if at all, higher than at any previous
time for similar accommodation; for the rate of profits on the turnover which is earned
by capital engaged in building is now low, and the labour cost of building materials
has not much altered. And it must be remembered that those who pay the high town
rents get in return the amusements and other advantages of modern town life, which
many of them would not be willing to forego for the sake of a much greater gain than
their total rent.

The labour value of wood, though lower than at the beginning of the century, is higher
than in the middle ages: but that of mud, brick or stone walls has not much changed;
while that of iron—to say nothing of glass—has fallen much.
And indeed the popular belief that house rent proper has risen, appears to be due to an
imperfect acquaintance with the way in which our forefathers were really housed. The
modern suburban artisan's cottage contains sleeping accommodation far superior to
that of the gentry in the middle ages; and the working classes had then no other beds
than loose straw, reeking with vermin, and resting on damp mud floors. Even these
were probably less unwholesome, when bare and shared between human beings and
live stock, than when an attempt at respectability covered them with rushes, which
were nearly always vile with long accumulated refuse: but it is undeniable that the
housing of the very poorest classes in our towns now is destructive both of body and
soul; and that with our present knowledge and resources we have neither cause nor
excuse for allowing it to continue141 .

Fuel, like grass, is often a free gift of nature to a sparse population; and during the
middle ages the cottagers could generally, though not always, get the little brushwood
fire needed to keep them warm as they huddled together round it in huts which had no
chimney through which the heat could go to waste. But as population increased the
scarcity of fuel pressed heavily on the working classes, and would have arrested
England's progress altogether, had not coal been ready to take the place of wood as
fuel for domestic purposes, as well as for smelting iron. It is now so cheap that even
the comparatively poor can keep themselves warm indoors without living in an
unwholesome and stupefying atmosphere.

This is one of the great services that coal has wrought for modern civilization.
Another is to provide cheap underclothing, without which cleanliness is impossible
for the masses of the people in a cold climate: and that is perhaps the chief of the
benefits that England has gained from the direct application of machinery to making
commodities for her own use. Another, and not less important service, is to provide
abundant water, even in large towns142 ; and another to supply, with the aid of
mineral oil, that cheap and artificial light which is needed not only for some of man's
work, but, what is of higher moment, for the good use of his evening leisure. To this
group of requisites for a civilized life, derived from coal on the one hand, and modern
means of transport on the other, we must add, as has just been noticed, the cheap and
thorough means of communication of news and thought by steam-presses, by steam-
carried letters and steam-made facilities for travel. These agencies, aided by
electricity, are rendering possible the civilization of the masses in countries the
climate of which is not so warm as to be enervating; and are preparing the way for
true self-government and united action by the whole people, not merely of a town
such as Athens, Florence or Bruges, but a broad country, and even in some respects of
the whole civilized world143 .

§ 6. We have seen that the national dividend is at once the aggregate net product of,
and the sole source of payment for, all the agents of production within the country;
that the larger it is, the larger, other things being equal, will be the share of each agent of production, and that an increase in the supply of any agent will generally lower its
price, to the benefit of other agents.

This general principle is specially applicable to the case of land. An increase in the
amount of productiveness of the land that supplies any market redounds in the first
instance to the benefit of those capitalists and workers who are in possession of other
agents of production for the same market. And the influence on values which has been
exerted in the modern age by the new means of transport is nowhere so conspicuous
as in the history of land; its value rises with every improvement in its communications
with markets in which its produce can be sold, and its value falls with every new
access to its own markets of produce from more distant places. It is not very long ago
that the home counties were full of fears that the making of good roads would enable
the more distant parts of England to compete with them in supplying London with
food; and now the differential advantages of English farms are in some respects being
lowered by the importation of food that has travelled on Indian and American
railroads, and been carried in ships made of steel and driven by steam turbines.

But as Malthus contended, and Ricardo admitted, anything that promotes the
prosperity of the people promotes also in the long run that of the landlords of the soil.
It is true that English rents rose very fast when, at the beginning of last century, a
series of bad harvests struck down a people that could not import their food; but a rise
so caused could not from the nature of the case have gone very much further. And the
adoption of free trade in corn in the middle of the century, followed by the expansion
of American wheat-fields, is rapidly raising the real value of the land urban and rural
taken together; that is, it is raising the amount of the necessaries, comforts and
luxuries of life which can be purchased by the aggregate rental of all the landowners
urban and rural taken together144 .

§ 7. But though the development of the industrial environment tends on the whole to
raise the value of land, it more often than not lessens the value of machinery and other
kinds of fixed capital, in so far as their value can be separated from that of the sites on
which they rest. A sudden burst of prosperity may indeed enable the existing stock of
appliances in any trade to earn for a time a very high income. But things which can be
multiplied without limit cannot retain for long a scarcity value; and if they are fairly
durable, as for instance ships and blast furnaces and textile machinery, they are likely
to suffer great depreciation from the rapid progress of improvement.
The value of such things as railways and docks however depends in the long run
chiefly on their situation. If that is good, the progress of their industrial environment
will raise their net value even after allowance has been made for the charges to which
they may be put in keeping their appliances abreast of the age145 .
§ 8. Political Arithmetic may be said to have begun in England in the seventeenth
century; and from that time onwards we find a constant and nearly steady increase in
the amount of accumulated wealth per head of the population146 .
Man, though still somewhat impatient of delay, has gradually become more willing to
sacrifice ease or other enjoyment in order to obtain them in the future. He has acquired a greater "telescopic" faculty; that is, he has acquired an increased power of
realizing the future and bringing it clearly before his mind's eye: he is more prudent,
and has more self-control, and is therefore more inclined to estimate at a high rate
future ills and benefits—these terms being used broadly to include the highest and
lowest affections of the human mind. He is more unselfish, and therefore more
inclined to work and save in order to secure a future provision for his family; and
there are already faint signs of a brighter time to come, in which there will be a
general willingness to work and save in order to increase the stores of public wealth
and of public opportunities for leading a higher life.

But though he is more willing than in earlier ages to incur present ills for the sake of
future benefits, it is doubtful whether we can now trace a continued increase in the
amount of exertion which he is willing to undergo for the sake of obtaining positive
pleasures, whether present or future. During many generations the industry of the
western world has steadily become more sedulous: holidays have diminished, the
hours of work have increased, and people have from choice or necessity contented
themselves with less and less search for pleasure outside their work. But it would
seem that this movement has reached its maximum, and is now declining. In all
grades of work except the very highest, people are getting to prize relaxation more
highly than before, and are becoming more impatient of the fatigue that results from
excessive strain; and they are perhaps on the whole less willing than they used to be to
undergo the constantly increasing "discommodity" of very long hours of work, for the
sake of obtaining present luxuries. These causes would make them less willing than
before to work hard in order to provide against distant needs, were it not that there is
an even more rapid increase in their power of realizing the future, and
perhaps—though this is more doubtful—in their desire for that social distinction
which comes from the possession of some small store of accumulated wealth.

This increase of capital per head tended to diminish its marginal utility; and therefore
the rate of interest on new investments fell, though not uniformly. It was reported to
be 10 per cent. during a great part of the middle ages; but it fell to 3 per cent. in the
earlier half of the eighteenth century. The subsequent vast industrial and political
demand for capital raised it again, and it was relatively high during the great war. It
fell when the political drain had ceased, the gold supply at the time being very small;
but it rose in the third quarter of last century, when new gold abounded, and capital
was much needed for railways and the development of new countries. After 1873 an
era of peace, combined with a slackening of the gold supply, lowered interest; but
now it is rising again, partly in consequence of an increased gold supply147 .
§ 9. The growth of general enlightenment and of a sense of responsibility towards the
young has turned a great deal of the increasing wealth of the nation from investment
as material capital to investment as personal capital. There has resulted a largely
increased supply of trained abilities, which has much increased the national dividend,
and raised the average income of the whole people: but it has taken away from these
trained abilities much of that scarcity value which they used to possess, and has
lowered their earnings not indeed absolutely, but relatively to the general advance;
and it has caused many occupations, which not long ago were accounted skilled, and
which are still spoken of as skilled, to rank with unskilled labour as regards wages.

A striking instance is that of writing. It is true that many kinds of office work require
a rare combination of high mental and moral qualities; but almost any one can be
easily taught to do the work of a copying clerk, and probably there will soon be few
men or women in England who cannot write fairly well. When all can write, the work
of copying, which used to earn higher wages than almost any kind of manual labour,
will rank among unskilled trades. In fact the better kinds of artisan work educate a
man more, and will be better paid than those kinds of clerk's work which call for
neither judgment nor responsibility. And, as a rule, the best thing that an artisan can
do for his son is to bring him up to do thoroughly the work that lies at his hand, so
that he may understand the mechanical, chemical or other scientific principles that
bear upon it; and may enter into the spirit of any new improvement that may be made
in it. If his son should prove to have good natural abilities, he is far more likely to rise
to a high position in the world from the bench of an artisan than from the desk of a
clerk.

Again a new branch of industry is often difficult simply because it is unfamiliar; and
men of great force and skill are required to do work, which can be done by men of
ordinary capacity or even by women and children, when the track has once been well
beaten: its wages are high at first, but they fall as it becomes familiar. And this has
caused the rise of average wages to be underrated, because it so happens that many of
the statistics, which seem typical of general movements of wages, are taken from
trades which were comparatively new a generation or two ago, and are now within the
grasp of men of much less real ability than those who pioneered the way for them148
.
The consequence of such changes as these is to increase the number of those
employed in occupations which are called skilled, whether the term is now properly
applied or not: and this constant increase in the numbers of workers in the higher
classes of trades has caused the average of all labour to rise much faster than the
average of representative wages in each trade149 .

In the middle ages, though some men of great ability remained artisans all their lives,
and became artists; yet as a class the artisans ranked more nearly with the unskilled
labourers than they do now. At the beginning of the new industrial era in the middle
of the eighteenth century the artisans had lost much of their old artistic traditions and
had not yet acquired that technical command over their instruments, that certainty and
facility in the exact performance of difficult tasks which belong to the modern skilled
artisan. A change set in early in last century, and observers were struck by the social
gulf that was opening out between skilled and unskilled labour; and the rise of the
wages of the artisan, to about double those of ordinary labour. For indeed the great
increase in the demand for highly skilled labour, especially in the metal trades,
stimulated a rapid absorption of the strongest characters among the labourers and their
children into the ranks of the artisans. The breaking down just at that time of the old
exclusiveness of the artisans, was making them less than before an aristocracy by
birth and more than before an aristocracy by worth; and this rise in the quality of
artisans enabled them to maintain a rate of wages much above that of ordinary labour
for a long while. But gradually some of the simpler forms of skilled trades began to
lose their scarcity value, as their novelty wore off; and at the same time continually increasing demands began to be made on the ability of those in some trades, that were
traditionally ranked as unskilled. The navvy for instance, and the agricultural
labourer, have been increasingly trusted with expensive and complicated machinery,
which had been thought to belong only to the skilled trades, and the real wages of
these two representative occupations have risen fast. The rise of wages of agricultural
labourers would be more striking than it is, did not the spread of modern notions to
agricultural districts cause many of the ablest children born there to leave the fields
for the railway or the workshop, to become policemen, or to act as carters or porters in
towns. Those who are left behind in the fields have received a better education than
was to be had in earlier times; and, though having perhaps less than an average share
of natural ability, they earn much higher real wages than their fathers.
There are some skilled and responsible occupations, such as those of the head heaters
and rollers in iron works, which require great physical strength, and involve much
discomfort: and in them wages are very high. For the temper of the age makes those
who can do high-class work, and can earn good wages easily, refuse to undergo
hardship, except for a very high reward150 .

§ 10. We may next consider the changes in the relative wages of old and young men,
of women and children.

The conditions of industry change so fast that long experience is in some trades
almost a disadvantage, and in many it is of far less value than a quickness in taking
hold of new ideas and adapting one's habits to new conditions. A man is likely to earn
less after he is fifty years old than before he is thirty; and the knowledge of this is
tempting artisans to follow the example of unskilled labourers, whose natural
inclination to marry early has always been encouraged by the desire that their family
expenses may begin to fall off before their own wages begin to shrink.
A second and even more injurious tendency of the same kind is that of the wages of
children to rise relatively to those of their parents. Machinery has displaced many
men, but not many boys; the customary restrictions which excluded them from some
trades are giving way; and these changes, together with the spread of education, while
doing good in almost every other direction, are doing harm in this that they are
enabling boys, and even girls, to set their parents at defiance and start in life on their
own account.

The wages of women are for similar reasons rising fast relatively to those of men.
And this is a great gain in so far as it tends to develop their faculties; but an injury in
so far as it tempts them to neglect their duty of building up a true home, and of
investing their efforts in the personal capital of their children's character and abilities.
§ 11. The relative fall in the incomes to be earned by moderate ability, however
carefully trained, is accentuated by the rise in those that are obtained by many men of
extraordinary ability. There never was a time at which moderately good oil paintings
sold more cheaply than now, and there never was a time at which first-rate paintings
sold so dearly. A business man of average ability and average good fortune gets now a
lower rate of profits on his capital than at any previous time; while yet the operations, in which a man exceptionally favoured by genius and good luck can take part, are so
extensive as to enable him to amass a huge fortune with a rapidity hitherto unknown.
The causes of this change are chiefly two; firstly, the general growth of wealth; and
secondly, the development of new facilities for communication, by which men, who
have once attained a commanding position, are enabled to apply their constructive or
speculative genius to undertakings vaster, and extending over a wider area, than ever
before.

It is the first cause, almost alone, that enables some barristers to command very high
fees; for a rich client whose reputation, or fortune, or both, are at stake will scarcely
count any price too high to secure the services of the best man he can get: and it is this
again that enables jockeys and painters and musicians of exceptional ability to get
very high prices. In all these occupations the highest incomes earned in our own
generation are the highest that the world has yet seen. But so long as the number of
persons who can be reached by a human voice is strictly limited, it is not very likely
that any singer will make an advance on the £10,000, said to have been earned in a
season by Mrs Billington at the beginning of last century, nearly as great as that which
the business leaders of the present generation have made on those of the last.
For the two causes have co-operated to put enormous power and wealth in the hands
of those business men of our own generation in America and elsewhere, who have
had first-rate genius and have been favoured by fortune. It is true that a great part of
these gains have come, in some cases, from the wrecks of the rival speculators who
had been worsted in the race. But in others they were earned mainly by the supreme
economizing force of a great constructive genius working at a new and large problem
with a free hand: for instance the founder of the Vanderbilt family, who evolved the
New York Central Railroad system out of chaos, probably saved to the people of the
United States more than he accumulated himself151 .

§ 12. But these fortunes are exceptional. The diffusion of education, and prudent
habits among the masses of the people, and the opportunities which the new methods
of business offer for the safe investment of small capitals, are telling on the side of
moderate incomes. The returns of the income tax and the house tax, the statistics of
consumption of commodities, the records of salaries paid to the higher and the lower
ranks of employees of Government and public companies, all indicate that middle
class incomes are increasing faster than those of the rich; that the earnings of artisans
are increasing faster than those of the professional classes, and that the wages of
healthy and vigorous unskilled labourers are increasing faster even than those of the
average artisan. The aggregate income of the very rich is perhaps not a larger part of
the whole in England now than in earlier times. But in America the aggregate value of
land is rising fast; the higher strains of the working population are yielding ground to
lower strains of immigrants; and great financiers are acquiring vast power: and it may
possibly be true that the aggregate income from property is rising relatively to that
from labour, and that the aggregate income of the very rich is rising fastest of all.
It must be admitted that a rise in wages would lose part of its benefit, if it were
accompanied by an increase in the time spent in enforced idleness. Inconstancy of employment is a great evil, and rightly attracts public attention. But several causes
combine to make it appear to be greater than it really is.

When a large factory goes on half time, rumour bruits the news over the whole
neighbourhood, and perhaps the newspapers spread it all over the country. But few
people know when an independent workman, or even a small employer, gets only a
few days' work in a month; and in consequence, whatever suspensions of industry
there are in modern times, are apt to seem more important than they are relatively to
those of earlier times. In earlier times some labourers were hired by the year: but they
were not free, and were kept to their work by personal chastisement. There is no good
cause for thinking that the mediæval artisan had constant employment. And the most
persistently inconstant employment now to be found in Europe is in those non-
agricultural industries of the West which are most nearly mediæval in their methods,
and in those industries of Eastern and Southern Europe in which mediæval traditions
are strongest152 .

In many directions there is a steady increase in the proportion of employees who are
practically hired by the year. This is for instance the general rule in many of those
trades connected with transport which are growing fastest; and which are, in some
respects, the representative industries of the second half of the nineteenth century, as
the manufacturing trades were of the first half. And though the rapidity of invention,
the fickleness of fashion, and above all the instability of credit, do certainly introduce
disturbing elements into modern industry; yet, as we shall see presently, other
influences are working strongly in the opposite direction, and there seems to be no
good reason for thinking that inconstancy of employment is increasing on the whole.
