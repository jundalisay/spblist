JOINT AND COMPOSITE DEMAND. JOINT AND
COMPOSITE SUPPLY

§ 1. Bread satisfies man's wants directly: and the demand for it is said to be direct. But
a flour mill and an oven satisfy wants only indirectly, by helping to make bread, etc.,
and the demand for them is said to be indirect. More generally:—
The demand for raw materials and other means of production is indirect and is
derived from the direct demand for those directly serviceable products which they
help to produce.
The services of the flour mill and the oven are joined together in the ultimate product,
bread: the demand for them is therefore called a joint demand. Again, hops and malt
are complementary to one another; and are joined together in the common destination
of ale: and so on. Thus the demand for each of several complementary things is
derived from the services which they jointly render in the production of some ultimate
product, as for instance a loaf of bread, a cask of ale. In other words there is a joint
demand for the services which any of these things render in helping to produce a thing
which satisfies wants directly and for which there is therefore a direct demand: the
direct demand for the finished product is in effect split up into many derived demands
for the things used in producing it46 .
To take another illustration, the direct demand for houses gives rise to a joint demand
for the labour of all the various building trades, and for bricks, stone, wood, etc.
which are factors of production of building work of all kinds, or as we may say for
shortness, of new houses. The demand for any one of these, as for instance the labour
of plasterers, is only an indirect or derived demand.
Let us pursue this last illustration with reference to a class of events that are of
frequent occurrence in the labour market; the period over which the disturbance
extends being short, and the causes of which we have to take account as readjusting
demand and supply being only such as are able to operate within that short period.
This case has important practical bearings, which give it a special claim on our
attention; but we should notice that, referring as it does to short periods, it is an
exception to our general rule of selecting illustrations in this and the neighbouring
chapters from cases in which there is time enough for the full long-period action of
the forces of supply to be developed.
Let us then suppose that the supply and demand for building being in equilibrium,
there is a strike on the part of one group of workers, say the plasterers, or that there is
some other disturbance to the supply of plasterers' labour. In order to isolate and make
a separate study of the demand for that factor, we suppose firstly that the general conditions of the demand for new houses remain unchanged (that is, that the demand
schedule for new houses remains valid); and secondly we assume that there is no
change in the general conditions of supply of the other factors, two of which are of
course the business faculties and the business organizations of the master builders;
(that is, we assume that their lists of supply prices also remain valid). Then a
temporary check to the supply of plasterers' labour will cause a proportionate check to
the amount of building: the demand price for the diminished number of houses will be
a little higher than before; and the supply prices for the other factors of production
will not be greater than before47 . Thus new houses can now be sold at prices which
exceed by a good margin the sum of the prices at which these other requisites for the
production of houses can be bought; and that margin gives the limit to the possible
rise of the price that will be offered for plasterers' labour, on the supposition that
plasterers' labour is indispensable. The different amounts of this margin,
corresponding to different checks to the supply of plasterers' labour, are governed by
the general rule that:— The price that will be offered for any thing used in producing
a commodity is, for each separate amount for the commodity, limited by the excess of
the price at which that amount of the commodity can find purchasers, over the sum of
the prices at which the corresponding supplies of the other things needed for making it
will be forthcoming.
To use technical terms, the demand schedule for any factor of production of a
commodity can be derived from that for the commodity by subtracting from the
demand price of each separate amount of the commodity the sum of the supply prices
for corresponding amounts of the other factors48 .
§ 2. When however we come to apply this theory to the actual conditions of life, it
will be important to remember that if the supply of one factor is disturbed, the supply
of others is likely to be disturbed also. In particular, when the factor of which the
supply is disturbed is one class of labour, as that of the plasterers, the employers'
earnings generally act as a buffer. That is to say, the loss falls in the first instance on
them; but by discharging some of their workmen and lowering the wages of others,
they ultimately distribute a great part of it among the other factors of production. The
details of the process by which this is effected are various, and depend on the action
of trade combinations, on the higgling and bargaining of the market, and on other
causes with which we are not just at present concerned.
Let us inquire what are the conditions, under which a check to the supply of a thing
that is wanted not for direct use, but as a factor of production of some commodity,
may cause a very great rise in its price. The first condition is that the factor itself
should be essential, or nearly essential to the production of the commodity, no good
substitute being available at a moderate price.
The second condition is that the commodity in the production of which it is a
necessary factor, should be one for which the demand is stiff and inelastic; so that a
check to its supply will cause consumers to offer a much increased price for it rather
than go without it; and this of course includes the condition that no good substitutes
for the commodity are available at a price but little higher than its equilibrium price. If
the check to house building raises the price of houses very much, builders, anxious to secure the exceptional profits, will bid against one another for such plasterers' labour
as there is in the market49 .

The third condition is that only a small part of the expenses of production of the
commodity should consist of the price of this factor. Since the plasterer's wages are
but a small part of the total expenses of building a house, a rise of even 50 per cent. in
them would add but a very small percentage to the expenses of production of a house
and would check demand but little50 .
The fourth condition is that even a small check to the amount demanded should cause
a considerable fall in the supply prices of other factors of production; as that will
increase the margin available for paying a high price for this one51 . If, for instance,
bricklayers and other classes of workmen, or the employers themselves cannot easily
find other things to do, and cannot afford to remain idle, they may be willing to work
for much lower earnings than before, and this will increase the margin available for
paying higher wages to plasterers. These four conditions are independent, and the
effects of the last three are cumulative.
The rise in plasterers' wages would be checked if it were possible either to avoid the
use of plaster, or to get the work done tolerably well and at a moderate price by
people outside the plasterers' trade: the tyranny, which one factor of production of a
commodity might in some cases exercise over the other factors through the action of
derived demand, is tempered by the principle of substitution52 .
Again, an increased difficulty in obtaining one of the factors of a finished commodity
can often be met by modifying the character of the finished product. Some plasterers'
labour may be indispensable; but people are often in doubt how much plaster work it
is worth while to have in their houses, and if there is a rise in its price they will have
less of it. The intensity of the satisfaction of which they would be deprived if they had
a little less of it, is its marginal utility; the price which they are just willing to pay in
order to have it, is the true demand price for plasterers' work up to the amount which
is being used.
So again there is a joint demand for malt and hops in ale. But their proportions can be
varied. A higher price can be got for an ale which differs from others only in
containing more hops; and this excess price represents the demand for hops53 .
The relations between plasterers, bricklayers, etc., are representative of much that is
both instructive and romantic in the history of alliances and conflicts between trades-
unions in allied trades. But the most numerous instances of joint demand are those of
the demand for a raw material and the operatives who work it up; as for instance
cotton or jute or iron or copper, and those who work up these several materials.
Again, the relative prices of different articles of food vary a good deal with the supply
of skilled cooks' labour: thus for instance many kinds of meat and many parts of
vegetables which are almost valueless in America, where skilled cooks are rare and
expensive, have a good value in France, where the art of cooking is widely diffused.


§ 3. We have already54 discussed the way in which the aggregate demand for any
commodity is compounded of the demands of the different groups of people who may
need it. But we now may extend this notion of composite demand to requisites of
production which are needed by several groups of producers.
Nearly every raw material and nearly every kind of labour is applied in many different
branches of industry, and contributes to the production of a great variety of
commodities. Each of these commodities has its own direct demand; and from that the
derived demand for any of the things used in making it can be found, and the thing is
"distributed between its various uses" in the manner which we have already
discussed55 . The various uses are rivals, or competitors with one another; and the
corresponding derived demands are rival or competitive demands relatively to one
another. But in relation to the supply of the product, they co-operate with one another;
being "compounded" into the total demand that carries off the supply: in just the same
way as the partial demands of several classes of society for a finished commodity are
aggregated, or compounded together into the total demand for it56 .
§ 4. We may now pass to consider the case of joint products: i.e. of things which
cannot easily be produced separately; but are joined in a common origin, and may
therefore be said to have a joint supply, such as beef and hides, or wheat and straw57 .
This case corresponds to that of things which have a joint demand, and it may be
discussed almost in the same words, by merely substituting "demand" for "supply,"
and vice versâ. As there is a joint demand for things joined in a common destination:
so there is a joint supply of things which have a common origin. The single supply of
the common origin is split up into so many derived supplies of the things that proceed
from it58 .

For instance, since the repeal of the Corn Laws much of the wheat consumed in
England has been imported, of course without any straw. This has caused a scarcity
and a consequent rise in the price of straw, and the farmer who grows wheat looks to
the straw for a great part of the value of the crop. The value of straw then is high in
countries which import wheat, and low in those which export wheat. In the same way
the price of mutton in the wool-producing districts of Australia was at one time very
low. The wool was exported, the meat had to be consumed at home; and as there was
no great demand for it, the price of the wool had to defray almost the whole of the
joint expenses of production of the wool and the meat. Afterwards the low price of
meat gave a stimulus to the industries of preserving meat for exportation, and now its
price in Australia is higher.
There are very few cases of joint products the cost of production of both of which
together is exactly the same as that of one of them alone. So long as any product of a
business has a market value, it is almost sure to have devoted to it some special care
and expense, which would be diminished, or dispensed with if the demand for that
product were to fall very much. Thus, for instance, if straw were valueless, farmers
would exert themselves more than they do to make the ear bear as large a proportion
as possible to the stalk. Again, the importation of foreign wool has caused English
sheep to be adapted by judicious crossing and selection so as to develop heavy
weights of good meat at an early age, even at the expense of some deterioration of
their wool. It is only when one of two things produced by the same process is
valueless, unsaleable, and yet does not involve any expense for its removal, that there
is no inducement to attempt to alter its amount; and, it is only in these exceptional
cases that we have no means of assigning its separate supply price to each of the joint
products. For when it is possible to modify the proportions of these products, we can
ascertain what part of the whole expense of the process of production would be saved,
by so modifying these proportions as slightly to diminish the amount of one of the
joint products without affecting the amounts of the others. That part of the expense is
the expense of production of the marginal element of that product; it is the supply
price of which we are in search59 .
But these are exceptional cases. It more frequently happens that a business, or even an
industry finds its advantage in using a good deal of the same plant, technical skill, and
business organization for several classes of products. In such cases the cost of
anything used for several purposes has to be defrayed by its fruits in all of them: but
there is seldom any rule of nature to determine either the relative importance of these uses, or the proportions in which the total cost should be distributed among them:
much depends on the changing features of markets60 .

§ 5. We may pass to the problem of composite supply which is analogous to that of
composite demand. A demand can often be satisfied by any one of several routes,
according to the principle of substitution. These various routes are rivals or
competitors with one another; and the corresponding supplies of commodities are
rival, or competitive supplies relatively to one another. But in relation to the demand
they co-operate with one another; being "compounded" into the total supply that
meets the demand61 .
If the causes which govern their production are nearly the same, they may for many
purposes be treated as one commodity62 . For instance, beef and mutton may be
treated as varieties of one commodity for many purposes; but they must be treated as
separate for others, as for instance for those in which the question of the supply of
wool enters. Rival things are however often not finished commodities, but factors of
production: for instance, there are many rival fibres which are used in making
ordinary printing paper. We have just noticed how the fierce action of derived demand
for one of several complementary supplies, as e.g. for the supply of plasterers' labour,
was liable to be moderated, when the demand was met by the competitive supply of a
rival thing, which could be substituted for it63 .
§ 6. All the four chief problems which have been discussed in this chapter have some
bearing on the causes that govern the value of almost every commodity: and many of
the most important cross connections between the values of different commodities are
not obvious at first sight.
Thus when charcoal was generally used in making iron, the price of leather depended
in some measure on that of iron; and the tanners petitioned for the exclusion of
foreign iron in order that the demand on the part of English iron smelters for oak
charcoal might cause the production of English oak to be kept up, and thus prevent
oak bark from becoming dear64 . This instance may serve to remind us of the way in
which an excessive demand for a thing may cause its sources of supply to be
destroyed, and thus render scarce any joint products that it may have: for the demand
for wood on the part of the ironmakers led to a relentless destruction of many forests
in England. Again, an excessive demand for lamb was assigned as a cause of the
prevailing scarcity of sheep some years ago; while some argued on the contrary that
the better the price to be got for spring lamb sold to the rich, the more profitable
would be the production of sheep, and the cheaper would mutton be for the people.
The fact is that an increase of demand may have opposite effects according as it does
or does not act so suddenly as to prevent producers from adapting their action to it.
Again, the development of railways and other means of communication for the benefit
of one trade, as for instance wheat growing in some parts of America and silver
mining in others, greatly lowers some of the chief expenses of production of nearly
every other product of those districts. Again, the prices of soda, and bleaching
materials and other products of industries, the chief raw material of which is salt,
move up and down relatively to one another with almost every improvement in the various processes which are used in those industries; and every change in those prices
affects the prices of many other goods, for the various products of the salt industries
are more or less important factors in many branches of manufacture.

Again, cotton and cotton-seed oil are joint products, and the recent fall in the price of
cotton is largely due to the improved manufacture and uses of cotton-seed oil: and
further, as the history of the cotton famine shows, the price of cotton largely affects
that of wool, linen and other things of its own class; while cotton-seed oil is ever
opening up new rivalries with things of its own class. Again, many new uses have
been found for straw in manufacture; and these inventions are giving value to straw
that used to be burnt in the West of America, and tend to hinder the rise in the
marginal cost of producing wheat65 .
