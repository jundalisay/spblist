THE INVESTMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES.

§ 1. The first difficulty to be cleared up in our study of normal values, is the nature of
the motives which govern the investment of resources for a distant return. It will be
well to begin by watching the action of a person who neither buys what he wants nor
sells what he makes, but works on his own behalf; and who therefore balances the
efforts and sacrifices which he makes on the one hand against the pleasures which he
expects to derive from their fruit on the other, without the intervention of any money
payments at all.

Let us then take the case of a man who builds a house for himself on land, and of
materials, which nature supplies gratis; and who makes his implements as he goes, the
labour of making them being counted as part of the labour of building the house. He
would have to estimate the efforts required for building on any proposed plan; and to
allow almost instinctively an amount increasing in geometrical proportion (a sort of
compound interest) for the period that would elapse between each effort and the time
when the house would be ready for his use. The utility of the house to him when
finished would have to compensate him not only for the efforts, but for the waitings22
.

If the two motives, one deterring, the other impelling, seemed equally balanced, he
would be on the margin of doubt. Probably the gain would much more than outweigh
the "real" cost with regard to some part of the house. But as he turned over more and
more ambitious plans, he would at last find the advantages of any further extension
balanced by the efforts and waitings required for making it; and that extension of the
building would be on the outer limit, or margin of profitableness of the investment of
his capital.

There would probably be several ways of building parts of the house; some parts for
instance might almost equally well be built of wood or of rough stones: the
investment of capital on each plan for each part of the accommodation would be
compared with the advantages offered thereby, and each would be pushed forward till
the outer limit or margin of profitableness had been reached. Thus there would be a
great many margins of profitableness: one corresponding to each kind of plan on
which each kind of accommodation might be provided.

§ 2. This illustration may serve to keep before us the way in which the efforts and
sacrifices which are the real cost of production of a thing, underlie the expenses which
are its money cost. But, as has just been remarked, the modern business man
commonly takes the payments which he has to make, whether for wages or raw
material, as he finds them; without staying to inquire how far they are an accurate
measure of the efforts and sacrifices to which they correspond. His expenditure is generally made piece-meal; and the longer he expects to wait for the fruit of any
outlay, the richer must that fruit be in order to compensate him. The anticipated fruit
may not be certain; and in that case he will have to allow for the risk of failure. After
making that allowance, the fruit of the outlay must be expected to exceed the outlay
itself by an amount which, independently of his own remuneration, increases at
compound interest in proportion to the time of waiting23 . Under this head are to be
entered the heavy expenses, direct and indirect, which every business must incur in
building up its connection.

For brevity we may speak of any element of outlay (allowance being made for the
remuneration of the undertaker himself) when increased by compound interest in this
way, as accumulated; just as we used the term discounted to represent the present
value of a future gratification. Each element of outlay has then to be accumulated for
the time which will elapse between its being incurred and its bearing fruit; and the
aggregate of these accumulated elements is the total outlay involved in the enterprise.
The balance between efforts and the satisfactions resulting from them may be made
up to any day that is found convenient. But whatever day is chosen, one simple rule
must be followed:—Every element whether an effort or a satisfaction, which dates
from a time anterior to that day, must have compound interest for the interval
accumulated upon it: and every element, which dates from a time posterior to that
day, must have compound interest for the interval discounted from it. If the day be
anterior to the beginning of the enterprise, then every element must be discounted.
But if, as is usual in such cases, the day be that when the efforts are finished, and the
house is ready for use; then the efforts must carry compound interest up to that day,
and the satisfactions must all be discounted back to that day.

Waiting is an element of cost as truly as effort is, and it is entered in the cost when
accumulated: it is therefore of course not counted separately. Similarly, on the
converse side, whatever money or command over satisfaction "comes in" at any time
is part of the income of that time: if the time is before the day for which accounts are
balanced up, then it must be accumulated up to that day; if after, it must be discounted
back. If, instead of being converted to immediate enjoyment, it is used as a stored up
source of future income, that later income must not be counted as an additional return
to the investment24 .

If the enterprise were, say, to dig out a dock-basin on a contract, the payment for
which would be made without fail when the work was finished; and if the plant used
in the work might be taken to be worn out in the process, and valueless at the end of
it; then the enterprise would be just remunerative if this aggregate of outlays,
accumulated up to the period of payment, were just equal to that payment.
But, as a rule, the proceeds of the sales come in gradually; and we must suppose a
balance-sheet struck, looking both backwards and forwards. Looking backwards we
should sum up the net outlays, and add in accumulated compound interest on each
element of outlay. Looking forwards we should sum up all net incomings, and from
the value of each subtract compound interest for the period during which it would be
deferred. The aggregate of the net incomings so discounted would be balanced against
the aggregate of the accumulated outlays: and if the two were just equal, the business would be just remunerative. In calculating the outgoings the head of the business must
reckon in the value of his own work25 .

§ 3. At the beginning of his undertaking, and at every successive stage, the alert
business man strives so to modify his arrangements as to obtain better results with a
given expenditure, or equal results with a less expenditure. In other words, he
ceaselessly applies the principle of substitution, with the purpose of increasing his
profits; and, in so doing, he seldom fails to increase the total efficiency of work, the
total power over nature which man derives from organization and knowledge.

Every locality has incidents of its own which affect in various ways the methods of
arrangement of every class of business that is carried on in it: and even in the same
place and the same trade no two persons pursuing the same aims will adopt exactly
the same routes. The tendency to variation is a chief cause of progress; and the abler
are the undertakers in any trade the greater will this tendency be. In some trades, as
for instance cotton-spinning, the possible variations are confined within narrow limits;
no one can hold his own at all who does not use machinery, and very nearly the latest
machinery, for every part of the work. But in others, as for instance in some branches
of the wood and metal trades, in farming, and in shopkeeping, there can be great
variations. For instance, of two manufacturers in the same trade, one will perhaps
have a larger wages bill and the other heavier charges on account of machinery: of
two retail dealers one will have a larger capital locked up in stock and the other will
spend more on advertisements and other means of building up the immaterial capital
of a profitable trade connection. And in minor details the variations are numberless.

Each man's actions are influenced by his special opportunities and resources, as well
as by his temperament and his associations: but each, taking account of his own
means, will push the investment of capital in his business in each several direction
until what appears in his judgment to be the outer limit, or margin, of profitableness is
reached; that is, until there seems to him no good reason for thinking that the gains
resulting from any further investment in that particular direction would compensate
him for his outlay. The margin of profitableness, even in regard to one and the same
branch or sub-branch of industry, is not to be regarded as a mere point on any one
fixed line of possible investment; but as a boundary line of irregular shape cutting one
after another every possible line of investment.

§ 4. This principle of substitution is closely connected with, and is indeed partly based
on, that tendency to a diminishing rate of return from any excessive application of
resources or of energies in any given direction, which is in accordance with general
experience. It is thus linked up with the broad tendency of a diminishing return to
increased applications of capital and labour to land in old countries which plays a
prominent part in classical economics. And it is so closely akin to the principle of the
diminution of marginal utility that results in general from increased expenditure, that
some applications of the two principles are almost identical. It has already been
observed that new methods of production bring into existence new commodities, or
lower the price of old commodities so as to bring them within the reach of increased
numbers of consumers: that on the other hand changes in the methods and volume of
consumption cause new developments of production, and new distribution of the resources of production: and that though some methods of consumption which
contribute most to man's higher life, do little if anything towards furthering the
production of material wealth, yet production and consumption are intimately
correlated26 . But now we are to consider more in detail how the distribution of the
resources of production between different industrial undertakings is the counterpart
and reflex of the distribution of the consumers' purchases between different classes of
commodities27 .

Let us revert to the primitive housewife, who having "a limited number of hanks of
yarn from the year's shearing, considers all the domestic wants for clothing and tries
to distribute the yarn between them in such a way as to contribute as much as possible
to the family wellbeing. She will think she has failed if, when it is done, she has
reason to regret that she did not apply more to making, say, socks, and less to vests.
But if, on the other hand, she hit on the right points to stop at, then she made just so
many socks and vests that she got an equal amount of good out of the last bundle of
yarn that she applied to socks, and the last she applied to vests28 ." If it happened that
two ways of making a vest were open to her, which were equally satisfactory as
regards results, but of which one, while using up a little more yarn, involved a little
less trouble than the other; then her problems would be typical of those of the larger
business world. They would include first decisions as to the relative urgency of
various ends; secondly, decisions as to the relative advantages of various means of
attaining each end; thirdly, decisions, based on these two sets of decisions, as to the
margin up to which she could most profitably carry the application of each means
towards each end.

These three classes of decisions have to be taken on a larger scale by the business
man, who has more complex balancings and adjustments to make before reaching
each decision29 . Let us take an illustration from the building trade. Let us watch the
operations of a "speculative builder" in the honourable sense of the term: that is, a
man who sets out to erect honest buildings in anticipation of general demand; who
bears the penalty of any error in his judgment; and who, if his judgment is approved
by events, benefits the community as well as himself. Let him be considering whether
to erect dwelling houses, or warehouses, or factories or shops. He is trained to form at
once a fairly good opinion as to the method of working most suitable for each class of
building, and to make a rough estimate of its cost. He estimates the cost of various
sites adapted for each class of building: and he reckons in the price that he would have
to pay for any site as a part of his capital expenditure, just as he does the expense to
which he would be put for laying foundations in it, and so on. He brings this estimate
of cost into relation with his estimate of the price he is likely to get for any given
building, together with its site. If he can find no case in which the demand price
exceeds his outlays by enough to yield him a good profit, with some margin against
risks, he may remain idle. Or he may possibly build at some risk in order to keep his
most trusty workmen together, and to find some occupation for his plant and his
salaried assistance: but more on this later on.

Suppose him now to have decided that (say) villa residences of a certain type, erected
on a plot of ground which he can buy, are likely to yield him a good profit. The main
end to be sought being thus settled, he sets himself to study more carefully the means by which it is to be obtained, and, in connection with that study, to consider possible
modifications in the details of his plans.
Given the general character of the houses to be built, he will have to consider in what
proportions to use various materials—brick, stone, steel, cement, plaster, wood, etc.,
with a view to obtaining the result which will contribute most, in proportion to its
cost, to the efficiency of the house in gratifying the artistic taste of purchasers and in
ministering to their comfort. In thus deciding what is the best distribution of his
resources between various commodities, he is dealing with substantially the same
problem as the primitive housewife, who has to consider the most economic
distribution of her yarn between the various needs of her household.

Like her, he has to reflect that the yield of benefit which any particular use gave
would be relatively large up to a certain point, and would then gradually diminish.
Like her, he has so to distribute his resources that they have the same marginal utility
in each use: he has to weigh the loss that would result from taking away a little
expenditure here, with the gain that would result from adding a little there. In effect
both of them work on lines similar to those which guide the farmer in so adjusting the
application of his capital and labour to land, that no field is stinted of extra cultivation
to which it would have given a generous return, and none receives so great an
expenditure as to call into strong activity the tendency to diminishing return in
agriculture30 .

Thus it is that the alert business man, as has just been said, "pushes the investment of
capital in his business in each several direction until what appears in his judgment to
be the outer limit, or margin, of profitableness is reached; that is, until there seems to
him no good reason for thinking that the gains resulting from any further investment
in that particular direction would compensate him for his outlay." He never assumes
that roundabout methods will be remunerative in the long run. But he is always on the
look out for roundabout methods that promise to be more effective in proportion to
their cost than direct methods: and he adopts the best of them, if it lies within his
means.

§ 5. Some technical terms relating to costs may be considered here. When investing
his capital in providing the means of carrying on an undertaking, the business man
looks to being recouped by the price obtained for its various products; and he expects
to be able under normal conditions to charge for each of them a sufficient price; that
is, one which will not only cover the special, direct, or prime cost, but also bear its
proper share of the general expenses of the business; and these we may call its
general, or supplementary cost. These two elements together make its total cost.
There are great variations in the usage of the term Prime cost in business. But it is
taken here in a narrow sense. Supplementary costs are taken to include standing
charges on account of the durable plant in which much of the capital of the business
has been invested, and also the salaries of the upper employees: for the charges to
which the business is put on account of their salaries cannot generally be adapted
quickly to changes in the amount of work there is for them to do. There remains
nothing but the (money) cost of the raw material used in making the commodity and the wages of that part of the labour spent on it which is paid by the hour or the piece
and the extra wear-and-tear of plant. This is the special cost which a manufacturer has
in view, when his works are not fully employed, and he is calculating the lowest price
at which it will be worth his while to accept an order, irrespectively of any effect that
his action may have in spoiling the market for future orders, and trade being slack at
the time. But in fact he must as a rule take account of this effect: the price at which it
is just worth his while to produce, even when trade is slack, is in practice generally a
good deal above this prime cost, as we shall see later on31 .

§ 6. Supplementary cost must generally be covered by the selling price to some
considerable extent in the short run. And they must be completely covered by it in the
long run; for, if they are not, production will be checked. Supplementary costs are of
many different kinds; and some of them differ only in degree from prime costs. For
instance, if an engineering firm is in doubt whether to accept an order at a rather low
price for a certain locomotive, the absolute prime costs include the value of the raw
material and the wages of the artisans and labourers employed on the locomotive. But
there is no clear rule as to the salaried staff: for, if work is slack, they will probably
have some time on their hands; and their salaries will therefore commonly be classed
among general or supplementary costs. The line of division is however often blurred
over. For instance, foremen and other trusted artisans are seldom dismissed merely
because of a temporary scarcity of work; and therefore an occasional order may be
taken to fill up idle time, even though its price does not cover their salaries and wages.
That is they may not be regarded as prime costs in such a case. But, of course the staff
in the office can be in some measure adjusted to variations in the work of the firm by
leaving vacancies unfilled and even by weeding out inefficient men during slack
times; and by getting extra help or putting out some of the work in busy times.
If we pass from such tasks to larger and longer tasks, as for instance the working out a
contract to deliver a great number of locomotives gradually over a period of several
years, then most of the office work done in connection with that order must be
regarded as special to it: for if it had been declined and nothing else taken in its place,
the expenses under the head of salaries could have been reduced almost to a
proportionate extent.

The case is much stronger when we consider a fairly steady market for any class of
staple manufactures extending over a long time. For then the outlay incurred for
installing specialized skill and organization, the permanent office staff, and the
durable plant of the workshops can all be regarded as part of the costs necessary for
the process of production. That outlay will be increased up to a margin at which the
branch of manufacture seems in danger of growing too fast for its market.
In the next chapter the argument of Chapter III. and of this chapter is continued. It is
shown in more detail how those costs which most powerfully act on supply and
therefore on price, are limited to a narrow and arbitrary group in the case of a single
contract for, say, a locomotive; but are much fuller, and correspond much more truly
to the broad features of industrial economy in the case of a continuous supply to a
fairly steady general market: the influence of cost of production on value does not
show itself clearly except in relatively long periods; and it is to be estimated with regard to a whole process of production rather than a particular locomotive, or a
particular parcel of goods. And a similar study is made in Chapters VIII.—X. of
variations in the character of those prime and supplementary costs which consist of
charges for interest (or profits) on investments in agents of production, according as
the periods of the market under consideration are long or short.

Meanwhile it may be noticed that the distinction between prime and supplementary
costs operates in every phase of civilization, though it is not likely to attract much
attention except in a capitalistic phase. Robinson Crusoe had to do only with real
costs and real satisfactions: and an old-fashioned peasant family, which bought little
and sold little, arranged its investments of present "effort and waiting" for future
benefits on nearly the same lines. But, if either were doubting whether it was worth
while to take a light ladder on a trip to gather wild fruits, the prime costs alone would
be weighed against the expected benefits: and yet the ladder would not have been
made, unless it had been expected to render sufficient service in the aggregate of
many little tasks, to remunerate the cost of making it. In the long run it had to repay
its total costs, supplementary as well as prime.

Even the modern employer has to look at his own labour as a real cost in the first
instance. He may think that a certain enterprise is likely to yield a surplus of money
incomings over money outgoings (after proper allowances for risks and for
discountings of future happenings); but that the surplus will amount to less than the
money equivalent of the trouble and worry that the enterprise will cause to himself:
and, in that case, he will avoid it32 .
