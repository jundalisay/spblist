§ 1. Economics, like every other science, collects facts, arranges and interprets them, and draws inferences from them. 

"Observation and description, definition and classification are the preparatory activities. But what we
desire to reach thereby is a knowledge of the interdependence of economic
phenomena.... 

Induction and deduction are both needed for scientific thought as the
right and left foot are both needed for walking11 ." The methods required for this
twofold work are not peculiar to economics; they are the common property of all
sciences. 

All the devices for the discovery of the relations between cause and effect,
which are described in treatises on scientific method, have to be used in their turn by
the economist: there is not any one method of investigation which can properly be
called the method of economics; but every method must be made serviceable in its
proper place, either singly or in combination with others. 

As the number of combinations that can be made on the chess-board, is so great that probably no two
games exactly alike were ever played; so no two games which the student plays with
nature to wrest from her her hidden truths, which were worth playing at all, ever made
use of quite the same methods in quite the same way.

But in some branches of economic inquiry and for some purposes, it is more urgent to
ascertain new facts, than to trouble ourselves with the mutual relations and
explanations of those which we already have. While in other branches there is still so
much uncertainty as to whether those causes of any event which lie on the surface and
suggest themselves at first are both true causes of it and the only causes of it, that it is
even more urgently needed to scrutinize our reasoning about facts which we already
know, than to seek for more facts.

For this and other reasons, there always has been and there probably always will be a
need for the existence side by side of workers with different aptitudes and different
aims, some of whom give their chief attention to the ascertainment of facts, while
others give their chief attention to scientific analysis; that is taking to pieces complex
facts, and studying the relations of the several parts to one another and to cognate
facts. It is to be hoped that these two schools will always exist; each doing its own
work thoroughly, and each making use of the work of the other. Thus best may we
obtain sound generalizations as to the past and trustworthy guidance from it for the
future.
§ 2. Those physical sciences, which have progressed most beyond the points to which
they were brought by the brilliant genius of the Greeks, are not all of them strictly
speaking "exact sciences." But they all aim at exactness. That is they all aim at
precipitating the result of a multitude of observations into provisional statements,
which are sufficiently definite to be brought under test by other observations of
nature. These statements, when first put forth, seldom claim a high authority. But after

they have been tested by many independent observations, and especially after they
have been applied successfully in the prediction of coming events, or of the results of
new experiments, they graduate as laws. A science progresses by increasing the
number and exactness of its laws; by submitting them to tests of ever increasing
severity; and by enlarging their scope till a single broad law contains and supersedes a
number of narrower laws, which have been shown to be special instances of it.
In so far as this is done by any science, a student of it can in certain cases say with
authority greater than his own (greater perhaps than that of any thinker, however able,
who relies on his own resources and neglects the results obtained by previous
workers), what results are to be expected from certain conditions, or what are the true
causes of a certain known event.
Although the subject-matter of some progressive physical sciences is not, at present at
least, capable of perfectly exact measurement; yet their progress depends on the
multitudinous co-operation of armies of workers. They measure their facts and define
their statements as closely as they can: so that each investigator may start as nearly as
possible where those before him left off. Economics aspires to a place in this group of
sciences: because though its measurements are seldom exact, and are never final; yet
it is ever working to make them more exact, and thus to enlarge the range of matters
on which the individual student may speak with the authority of his science.
§ 3. Let us then consider more closely the nature of economic laws, and their
limitations. Every cause has a tendency to produce some definite result if nothing
occurs to hinder it. Thus gravitation tends to make things fall to the ground: but when
a balloon is full of gas lighter than air, the pressure of the air will make it rise in spite
of the tendency of gravitation to make it fall. The law of gravitation states how any
two things attract one another; how they tend to move towards one another, and will
move towards one another if nothing interferes to prevent them. The law of
gravitation is therefore a statement of tendencies.
It is a very exact statement—so exact that mathematicians can calculate a Nautical
Almanac, which will show the moments at which each satellite of Jupiter will hide
itself behind Jupiter. They make this calculation for many years beforehand; and
navigators take it to sea, and use it in finding out where they are. Now there are no
economic tendencies which act as steadily and can be measured as exactly as
gravitation can: and consequently there are no laws of economics which can be
compared for precision with the law of gravitation.
But let us look at a science less exact than astronomy. The science of the tides
explains how the tide rises and falls twice a day under the action of the sun and the
moon: how there are strong tides at new and full moon, and weak tides at the moon's
first and third quarter; and how the tide running up into a closed channel, like that of
the Severn, will be very high; and so on. Thus, having studied the lie of the land and
the water all round the British isles, people can calculate beforehand when the tide
will probably be at its highest on any day at London Bridge or at Gloucester; and how
high it will be there. They have to use the word probably, which the astronomers do
not need to use when talking about the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites. For, though
PLL v6.0 (generated September, 2011)
24
http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/1676Online Library of Liberty: Principles of Economics (8th ed.)
many forces act upon Jupiter and his satellites, each one of them acts in a definite
manner which can be predicted beforehand: but no one knows enough about the
weather to be able to say beforehand how it will act. A heavy downpour of rain in the
upper Thames valley, or a strong north-east wind in the German Ocean, may make the
tides at London Bridge differ a good deal from what had been expected.
The laws of economics are to be compared with the laws of the tides, rather than with
the simple and exact law of gravitation. For the actions of men are so various and
uncertain, that the best statement of tendencies, which we can make in a science of
human conduct, must needs be inexact and faulty. This might be urged as a reason
against making any statements at all on the subject; but that would be almost to
abandon life. Life is human conduct, and the thoughts and emotions that grow up
around it. By the fundamental impulses of our nature we all—high and low, learned
and unlearned—are in our several degrees constantly striving to understand the
courses of human action, and to shape them for our purposes, whether selfish or
unselfish, whether noble or ignoble. And since we must form to ourselves some
notions of the tendencies of human action, our choice is between forming those
notions carelessly and forming them carefully. The harder the task, the greater the
need for steady patient inquiry; for turning to account the experience, that has been
reaped by the more advanced physical sciences; and for framing as best we can well
thought-out estimates, or provisional laws, of the tendencies of human action.
§ 4. The term "law" means then nothing more than a general proposition or statement
of tendencies, more or less certain, more or less definite. Many such statements are
made in every science: but we do not, indeed we can not, give to all of them a formal
character and name them as laws. We must select; and the selection is directed less by
purely scientific considerations than by practical convenience. If there is any general
statement which we want to bring to bear so often, that the trouble of quoting it at
length, when needed, is greater than that of burdening the discussion with an
additional formal statement and an additional technical name, then it receives a
special name, otherwise not12 .
Thus a law of social science, or a Social Law, is a statement of social tendencies; that
is, a statement that a certain course of action may be expected under certain
conditions from the members of a social group.
Economic laws, or statements of economic tendencies, are those social laws which
relate to branches of conduct in which the strength of the motives chiefly concerned
can be measured by a money price.
There is thus no hard and sharp line of division between those social laws which are,
and those which are not, to be regarded also as economic laws. For there is a
continuous gradation from social laws concerned almost exclusively with motives that
can be measured by price, to social laws in which such motives have little place; and
which are therefore generally as much less precise and exact than economic laws, as
those are than the laws of the more exact physical sciences.

Corresponding to the substantive "law" is the adjective "legal." But this term is used
only in connection with "law" in the sense of an ordinance of government; not in
connection with "law" the sense of a statement of relation between cause and effect.
The adjective used for this purpose is derived from "norma," a term which is nearly
equivalent to "law," and might perhaps with advantage be substituted for it in
scientific discussions. And following our definition of an economic law, we may say
that the course of action which may be expected under certain conditions from the
members of an industrial group is the normal action of the members of that group
relatively to those conditions.
This use of the term Normal has been misunderstood; and it may be well to say
something as to the unity in difference which underlies various uses of the term.
When we talk of a Good man or a Strong man, we refer to excellence or strength of
those particular physical mental or moral qualities which are indicated in the context.
A strong judge has seldom the same qualities as a strong rower; a good jockey is not
always of exceptional virtue. In the same way every use of the term normal implies
the predominance of certain tendencies which appear likely to be more or less
steadfast and persistent in their action over those which are relatively exceptional and
intermittent. Illness is an abnormal condition of man: but a long life passed without
any illness is abnormal. During the melting of the snows, the Rhine rises above its
normal level: but in a cold dry spring when it is less than usual above that normal
level, it may be said to be abnormally low (for that time of year). In all these cases
normal results are those which may be expected as the outcome of those tendencies
which the context suggests; or, in other words, which are in accordance with those
"statements of tendency," those Laws or Norms, which are appropriate to the context.
This is the point of view from which it is said that normal economic action is that
which may be expected in the long run under certain conditions (provided those
conditions are persistent) from the members of an industrial group. It is normal that
bricklayers in most parts of England are willing to work for 10d. an hour, but refuse to
work for 7d. In Johannesburg it may be normal that a brick-layer should refuse work
at much less than £1 a day. The normal price of bona fide fresh laid eggs may be
taken to be a penny when nothing is said as to the time of the year: and yet threepence
may be the normal price in town during January; and twopence may be an abnormally
low price then, caused by "unseasonable" warmth.
Another misunderstanding to be guarded against arises from the notion that only those
economic results are normal, which are due to the undisturbed action of free
competition. But the term has often to be applied to conditions in which perfectly free
competition does not exist, and can hardly even be supposed to exist; and even where
free competition is most dominant, the normal conditions of every fact and tendency
will include vital elements that are not a part of competition nor even akin to it. Thus,
for instance, the normal arrangement of many transactions in retail and wholesale
trade, and on Stock and Cotton Exchanges, rests on the assumption that verbal
contracts, made without witnesses, will be honourably discharged; and in countries in
which this assumption cannot legitimately be made, some parts of the Western
doctrine of normal value are inapplicable. Again, the prices of various Stock
PLL v6.0 (generated September, 2011)

http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/1676Online Library of Liberty: Principles of Economics (8th ed.)
Exchange securities are affected "normally" by the patriotic feelings not only of the
ordinary purchasers, but of the brokers themselves: and so on.
Lastly it is sometimes erroneously supposed that normal action in economics is that
which is right morally. But that is to be understood only when the context implies that
the action is being judged from the ethical point of view. When we are considering the
facts of the world, as they are, and not as they ought to be, we shall have to regard as
"normal" to the circumstances in view, much action which we should use our utmost
efforts to stop. For instance, the normal condition of many of the very poorest
inhabitants of a large town is to be devoid of enterprise, and unwilling to avail
themselves of the opportunities that may offer for a healthier and less squalid life
elsewhere; they have not the strength, physical, mental and moral, required for
working their way out of their miserable surroundings. The existence of a
considerable supply of labour ready to make match-boxes at a very low rate is normal
in the same way that a contortion of the limbs is a normal result of taking strychnine.
It is one result, a deplorable result, of those tendencies the laws of which we have to
study. This illustrates one peculiarity which economics shares with a few other
sciences, the nature of the material of which can be modified by human effort.
Science may suggest a moral or practical precept to modify that nature and thus
modify the action of laws of nature. For instance, economics may suggest practical
means of substituting capable workers for those who can only do such work as match-
box making; as physiology may suggest measures for so modifying the breeds of
cattle that they mature early, and carry much flesh on light frames. The laws of the
fluctuation of credit and prices have been much altered by increased powers of
prediction.
Again when "normal" prices are contrasted with temporary or market prices, the term
refers to the dominance in the long run of certain tendencies under given conditions.
But this raises some difficult questions which may be postponed13 .
§ 5. It is sometimes said that the laws of economics are "hypothetical." Of course, like
every other science, it undertakes to study the effects which will be produced by
certain causes, not absolutely, but subject to the condition that other things are equal,
and that the causes are able to work out their effects undisturbed. Almost every
scientific doctrine, when carefully and formally stated, will be found to contain some
proviso to the effect that other things are equal: the action of the causes in question is
supposed to be isolated; certain effects are attributed to them, but only on the
hypothesis that no cause is permitted to enter except those distinctly allowed for. It is
true however that the condition that time must be allowed for causes to produce their
effects is a source of great difficulty in economics. For meanwhile the material on
which they work, and perhaps even the causes themselves, may have changed; and the
tendencies which are being described will not have a sufficiently "long run" in which
to work themselves out fully. This difficulty will occupy our attention later on.
The conditioning clauses implied in a law are not continually repeated, but the
common sense of the reader supplies them for himself. In economics it is necessary to
repeat them oftener than elsewhere, because its doctrines are more apt than those of
any other science to be quoted by persons who have had no scientific training, and

who perhaps have heard them only at second hand, and without their context. One
reason why ordinary conversation is simpler in form than a scientific treatise, is that
in conversation we can safely omit conditioning clauses; because, if the hearer does
not supply them for himself, we quickly detect the misunderstanding, and set it right.
Adam Smith and many of the earlier writers on economics attained seeming
simplicity by following the usages of conversation, and omitting conditioning clauses.
But this has caused them to be constantly misunderstood, and has led to much waste
of time and trouble in profitless controversy; they purchased apparent ease at too great
a cost even for that gain14 .

Though economic analysis and general reasoning are of wide application, yet every
age and every country has its own problems; and every change in social conditions is
likely to require a new development of economic doctrines15 .
