§ 1. We have seen that the economist must be greedy of facts; but that facts by
themselves teach nothing. History tells of sequences and coincidences; but reason
alone can interpret and draw lessons from them. The work to be done is so various
that much of it must be left to be dealt with by trained common sense, which is the
ultimate arbiter in every practical problem. Economic science is but the working of
common sense aided by appliances of organized analysis and general reasoning,
which facilitate the task of collecting, arranging, and drawing inferences from
particular facts. Though its scope is always limited, though its work without the aid of
common sense is vain, yet it enables common sense to go further in difficult problems
than would otherwise be possible.

Economic laws are statements with regard to the tendencies of man's action under
certain conditions. They are hypothetical only in the same sense as are the laws of the
physical sciences: for those laws also contain or imply conditions. But there is more
difficulty in making the conditions clear, and more danger in any failure to do so, in
economics than in physics. The laws of human action are not indeed as simple, as
definite or as clearly ascertainable as the law of gravitation; but many of them may
rank with the laws of those natural sciences which deal with complex subject-matter.
The raison d'être of economics as a separate science is that it deals chiefly with that
part of man's action which is most under the control of measurable motives; and
which therefore lends itself better than any other to systematic reasoning and analysis.
We cannot indeed measure motives of any kind, whether high or low, as they are in
themselves: we can measure only their moving force. Money is never a perfect
measure of that force; and it is not even a tolerably good measure unless careful
account is taken of the general conditions under which it works, and especially of the
riches or poverty of those whose action is under discussion. But with careful
precautions money affords a fairly good measure of the moving force of a great part
of the motives by which men's lives are fashioned.

The study of theory must go hand in hand with that of facts: and for dealing with most
modern problems it is modern facts that are of the greatest use. For the economic
records of the distant past are in some respects slight and untrustworthy; and the
economic conditions of early times are wholly unlike those of the modern age of free
enterprise, of general education, of true democracy, of steam, of the cheap press and
the telegraph.

§ 2. Economics has then as its purpose firstly to acquire knowledge for its own sake,
and secondly to throw light on practical issues. But though we are bound, before
entering on any study, to consider carefully what are its uses, we should not plan out
our work with direct reference to them. For by so doing we are tempted to break off each line of thought as soon as it ceases to have an immediate bearing on that
particular aim which we have in view at the time: the direct pursuit of practical aims
leads us to group together bits of all sorts of knowledge, which have no connection
with one another except for the immediate purposes of the moment; and which throw
but little light on one another. Our mental energy is spent in going from one to
another; nothing is thoroughly thought out; no real progress is made.
The best grouping, therefore, for the purposes of science is that which collects
together all those facts and reasonings which are similar to one another in nature: so
that the study of each may throw light on its neighbour. By working thus for a long
time at one set of considerations, we get gradually nearer to those fundamental unities
which are called nature's laws: we trace their action first singly, and then in
combination; and thus make progress slowly but surely. The practical uses of
economic studies should never be out of the mind of the economist, but his special
business is to study and interpret facts and to find out what are the effects of different
causes acting singly and in combination.

§ 3. This may be illustrated by enumerating some of the chief questions to which the
economist addresses himself. He inquires:—
What are the causes which, especially in the modern world, affect the consumption
and production, the distribution and exchange of wealth; the organization of industry
and trade; the money market; wholesale and retail dealing; foreign trade, and the
relations between employers and employed? How do all these movements act and
react upon one another? How do their ultimate differ from their immediate
tendencies?

Subject to what limitations is the price of anything a measure of its desirability? What
increase of wellbeing is primâ facie likely to result from a given increase in the
wealth of any class of society? How far is the industrial efficiency of any class
impaired by the insufficiency of its income? How far would an increase of the income
of any class, if once effected, be likely to sustain itself through its effects in increasing
their efficiency and earning power?

How far does, as a matter of fact, the influence of economic freedom reach (or how
far has it reached at any particular time) in any place, in any rank of society, or in any
particular branch of industry? What other influences are most powerful there; and
how is the action of all these influences combined? In particular, how far does
economic freedom tend of its own action to build up combinations and monopolies,
and what are their effects? How are the various classes of society likely to be affected
by its action in the long run; what will be the intermediate effects while its ultimate
results are being worked out; and, account being taken of the time over which they
will spread, what is the relative importance of these two classes of ultimate and
intermediate effects? What will be the incidence of any system of taxes? What
burdens will it impose on the community, and what revenue will it afford to the State?

§ 4. The above are the main questions with which economic science has to deal
directly, and with reference to which its main work of collecting facts, of analysing them and reasoning about them should be arranged. The practical issues which,
though lying for the greater part outside the range of economic science, yet supply a
chief motive in the background to the work of the economist, vary from time to time,
and from place to place, even more than do the economic facts and conditions which
form the material of his studies. The following problems seem to be of special
urgency now in our own country:

How should we act so as to increase the good and diminish the evil influences of
economic freedom, both in its ultimate results and in the course of its progress? If the
first are good and the latter evil, but those who suffer the evil, do not reap the good;
how far is it right that they should suffer for the benefit of others?
Taking it for granted that a more equal distribution of wealth is to be desired, how far
would this justify changes in the institutions of property, or limitations of free
enterprise even when they would be likely to diminish the aggregate of wealth? In
other words, how far should an increase in the income of the poorer classes and a
diminution of their work be aimed at, even if it involved some lessening of national
material wealth? How far could this be done without injustice, and without slackening
the energies of the leaders of progress? How ought the burdens of taxation to be
distributed among the different classes of society?

Ought we to rest content with the existing forms of division of labour? Is it necessary
that large numbers of the people should be exclusively occupied with work that has no
elevating character? Is it possible to educate gradually among the great mass of
workers a new capacity for the higher kinds of work; and in particular for undertaking
co-operatively the management of the business in which they are themselves
employed?

What are the proper relations of individual and collective action in a stage of
civilization such as ours? How far ought voluntary association in its various forms,
old and new, to be left to supply collective action for those purposes for which such
action has special advantages? What business affairs should be undertaken by society
itself acting through its government, imperial or local? Have we, for instance, carried
as far as we should the plan of collective ownership and use of open spaces, of works
of art, of the means of instruction and amusement, as well as of those material
requisites of a civilized life, the supply of which requires united action, such as gas
and water, and railways?

When government does not itself directly intervene, how far should it allow
individuals and corporations to conduct their own affairs as they please? How far
should it regulate the management of railways and other concerns which are to some
extent in a position of monopoly, and again of land and other things the quantity of
which cannot be increased by man? Is it necessary to retain in their full force all the
existing rights of property; or have the original necessities for which they were meant
to provide, in some measure passed away?
Are the prevailing methods of using wealth entirely justifiable? What scope is there
for the moral pressure of social opinion in constraining and directing individual action in those economic relations in which the rigidity and violence of government
interference would be likely to do more harm than good? In what respect do the duties
of one nation to another in economic matters differ from those of members of the
same nation to one another?

Economics is thus taken to mean a study of the economic aspects and conditions of
man's political, social and private life; but more especially of his social life. The aims
of the study are to gain knowledge for its own sake, and to obtain guidance in the
practical conduct of life, and especially of social life. The need for such guidance was
never so urgent as now; a later generation may have more abundant leisure than we
for researches that throw light on obscure points in abstract speculation, or in the
history of past times, but do not afford immediate aid in present difficulties.
But though thus largely directed by practical needs, economics avoids as far as
possible the discussion of those exigencies of party organization, and those
diplomacies of home and foreign politics of which the statesman is bound to take
account in deciding what measures that he can propose will bring him nearest to the
end that he desires to secure for his country. It aims indeed at helping him to
determine not only what that end should be, but also what are the best methods of a
broad policy devoted to that end. But it shuns many political issues, which the
practical man cannot ignore: and it is therefore a science, pure and applied, rather than
a science and an art. And it is better described by the broad term "Economics" than by
the narrower term "Political Economy."

§ 5. The economist needs the three great intellectual faculties, perception, imagination
and reason: and most of all he needs imagination, to put him on the track of those
causes of visible events which are remote or lie below the surface, and of those effects
of visible causes which are remote or lie below the surface.
The natural sciences and especially the physical group of them have this great
advantage as a discipline over all studies of man's action, that in them the investigator
is called on for exact conclusions which can be verified by subsequent observation or
experiment. His fault is soon detected if he contents himself with such causes and
such effects as lie on the surface; or again if he ignores the mutual interaction of the
forces of nature, wherein every movement modifies and is modified by all that
surround it. Nor does the thorough student of physics rest satisfied with a mere
general analysis; he is ever striving to make it quantitative; and to assign its proper
proportion to each element in his problem.

In sciences that relate to man exactness is less attainable. The path of least resistance
is sometimes the only one open: it is always alluring; and though it is also always
treacherous, the temptation is great to follow it even when a more thorough way can
be fought out by resolute work. The scientific student of history is hampered by his
inability to experiment and even more by the absence of any objective standard to
which his estimates of relative proportion can be referred. Such estimates are latent in
almost every stage of his argument: he cannot conclude that one cause or group of
causes has been overridden by another without making some implicit estimate of their
relative weights. And yet it is only by a great effort that he perceives how dependent he is on his own subjective impressions. The economist also is hampered by this
difficulty, but in a less degree than other students of man's action; for indeed he has
some share in those advantages which give precision and objectivity to the work of
the physicist. So long, at all events, as he is concerned with current and recent events,
many of his facts group themselves under classes as to which statements can be made
that are definite, and often were approximately accurate numerically: and thus he is at
some advantage in seeking for causes and for results which lie below the surface, and
are not easily seen; and in analyzing complex conditions into their elements and in
reconstructing a whole out of many elements.

In smaller matters, indeed, simple experience will suggest the unseen. It will, for
instance, put people in the way of looking for the harm to strength of character and to
family life that comes from ill-considered aid to the thriftless; even though what is
seen on the surface is almost sheer gain. But greater effort, a larger range of view, a
more powerful exercise of the imagination are needed in tracking the true results of,
for instance, many plausible schemes for increasing steadiness of employment. For
that purpose it is necessary to have learnt how closely connected are changes in credit,
in domestic trade, in foreign trade competition, in harvests, in prices; and how all of
these affect steadiness of employment for good and for evil. It is necessary to watch
how almost every considerable economic event in any part of the Western world
affects employment in some trades at least in almost every other part. If we deal only
with those causes of unemployment which are near at hand, we are likely to make no
good cure of the evils we see; and we are likely to cause evils, that we do not see. And
if we are to look for those which are far off and weigh them in the balance, then the
work before us is a high discipline for the mind.

Again, when by a "standard rule" or any other device wages are kept specially high in
any trade, imagination set agoing will try to track the lives of those who are prevented
by the standard rule from doing work, of which they are capable, at a price that people
are willing to pay for it. Are they pushed up, or are they pushed down? If some are
pushed up and some pushed down, as commonly happens, is it the many that are
pushed up and the few that are pushed down, or the other way about? If we look at
surface results, we may suppose that it is the many who are pushed up. But if, by the
scientific use of the imagination, we think out all the ways in which prohibitions,
whether on Trade Union authority or any other, prevent people from doing their best
and earning their best, we shall often conclude that it is the many who have been
pushed down, and the few who have been pushed up. Partly under English influence,
some Australasian colonies are making bold ventures, which hold out specious
promise of greater immediate comfort and ease to the workers. Australasia has indeed
a great reserve of borrowing power in her vast landed property: and should the
proposed short cuts issue in some industrial decadence, the fall may be slight and
temporary. But it is already being urged that England should move on similar lines:
and a fall for her would be more serious. What is needed, and what we may hope is
coming in the near future, is a larger study of such schemes of the same kind and by
the same order of minds as are applied to judging a new design for a battleship with
reference to her stability in bad weather.

In such problems as this it is the purely intellectual, and sometimes even the critical
faculties, which are most in demand. But economic studies call for and develop the
faculty of sympathy, and especially that rare sympathy which enables people to put
themselves in the place, not only of their comrades, but also of other classes. This
class sympathy is, for instance, strongly developed by inquiries, which are becoming
every day more urgent, of the reciprocal influences which character and earnings,
methods of employment and habits of expenditure exert on one another; of the ways
in which the efficiency of a nation is strengthened by and strengthens the confidences
and affections which hold together the members of each economic group—the family,
employers and employees in the same business, citizens of the same country; of the
good and evil that are mingled in the individual unselfishness and the class selfishness
of professional etiquette and of trade union customs; and of movements by which our
growing wealth and opportunities may best be turned to account for the wellbeing of
the present and coming generations.

§ 6. The economist needs imagination especially in order that he may develop his
ideals. But most of all he needs caution and reserve in order that his advocacy of
ideals may not outrun his grasp of the future.

After many more generations have passed, our present ideals and methods may seem
to belong to the infancy, rather than to the maturity of man. One definite advance has
already been made. We have learnt that every one until proved to be hopelessly weak
or base is worthy of full economic freedom: but we are not in a position to guess
confidently to what goal the advance thus begun will ultimately lead. In the later
Middle Ages a rough beginning was made of the study of the industrial organism,
regarded as embracing all humanity. Each successive generation has seen further
growths of that organism; but none has seen so large a growth as our own. The
eagerness with which it has been studied has grown with its growth; and no parallel
can be found in earlier times to the breadth and variety of the efforts that have been
made to comprehend it. But the chief outcome of recent studies is to make us
recognize more fully, than could be done by any previous generation, how little we
know of the causes by which progress is being fashioned, and how little we can
forecast the ultimate destiny of the industrial organism.

Some harsh employers and politicians, defending exclusive class privileges early in
last century, found it convenient to claim the authority of political economy on their
side; and they often spoke of themselves as "economists." And even in our own time,
that title has been assumed by opponents of generous expenditure on the education of
the masses of the people, in spite of the fact that living economists with one consent
maintain that such expenditure is a true economy, and that to refuse it is both wrong
and bad business from a national point of view. But Carlyle and Ruskin, followed by
many other writers who had no part in their brilliant and ennobling poetical visions,
have without examination held the great economists responsible for sayings and deeds
to which they were really averse; and in consequence there has grown up a popular
misconception of their thoughts and character.

The fact is that nearly all the founders of modern economics were men of gentle and
sympathetic temper, touched with the enthusiasm of humanity. They cared little for wealth for themselves; they cared much for its wide diffusion among the masses of
the people. They opposed antisocial monopolies however powerful. In their several
generations they supported the movement against the class legislation which denied to
trade unions privileges that were open to associations of employers; or they worked
for a remedy against the poison which the old Poor Law was instilling into the hearts
and homes of the agricultural and other labourers; or they supported the factory acts,
in spite of the strenuous opposition of some politicians and employers who claimed to
speak in their name. They were without exception devoted to the doctrine that the
wellbeing of the whole people should be the ultimate goal of all private effort and all
public policy. But they were strong in courage and caution; they appeared cold,
because they would not assume the responsibility of advocating rapid advances on
untried paths, for the safety of which the only guarantees offered were the confident
hopes of men whose imaginations were eager, but not steadied by knowledge nor
disciplined by hard thought.

Their caution was perhaps a little greater than necessary: for the range of vision even
of the great seers of that age was in some respects narrower than is that of most
educated men in the present time; when, partly through the suggestions of biological
study, the influence of circumstances in fashioning character is generally recognized
as the dominant fact in social science. Economists have accordingly now learnt to take
a larger and more hopeful view of the possibilities of human progress. They have
learnt to trust that the human will, guided by careful thought, can so modify
circumstances as largely to modify character; and thus to bring about new conditions
of life still more favourable to character; and therefore to the economic, as well as the
moral, wellbeing of the masses of the people. Now as ever it is their duty to oppose all
plausible short cuts to that great end, which would sap the springs of energy and
initiative.

The rights of property, as such, have not been venerated by those master minds who
have built up economic science; but the authority of the science has been wrongly
assumed by some who have pushed the claims of vested rights to extreme and
antisocial uses. It may be well therefore to note that the tendency of careful economic
study is to base the rights of private property not on any abstract principle, but on the
observation that in the past they have been inseparable from solid progress; and that
therefore it is the part of responsible men to proceed cautiously and tentatively in
abrogating or modifying even such rights as may seem to be inappropriate to the ideal
conditions of social life.
