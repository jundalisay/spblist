§ 1. Economics is a study of men as they live and move and think in the ordinary business of life.

But it concerns itself chiefly with those motives which affect, most
powerfully and most steadily, man's conduct in the business part of his life. Everyone
who is worth anything carries his higher nature with him into business; and, there as
elsewhere, he is influenced by his personal affections, by his conceptions of duty and
his reverence for high ideals. And it is true that the best energies of the ablest
inventors and organizers of improved methods and appliances are stimulated by a
noble emulation more than by any love of wealth for its own sake. But, for all that, the
steadiest motive to ordinary business work is the desire for the pay which is the
material reward of work. The pay may be on its way to be spent selfishly or
unselfishly, for noble or base ends; and here the variety of human nature comes into
play. But the motive is supplied by a definite amount of money: and it is this definite
and exact money measurement of the steadiest motives in business life, which has
enabled economics far to outrun every other branch of the study of man. Just as the
chemist's fine balance has made chemistry more exact than most other physical
sciences; so this economist's balance, rough and imperfect as it is, has made
economics more exact than any other branch of social science. But of course
economics cannot be compared with the exact physical sciences: for it deals with the
ever changing and subtle forces of human nature4.

The advantage which economics has over other branches of social science appears
then to arise from the fact that its special field of work gives rather larger
opportunities for exact methods than any other branch. It concerns itself chiefly with
those desires, aspirations and other affections of human nature, the outward
manifestations of which appear as incentives to action in such a form that the force or
quantity of the incentives can be estimated and measured with some approach to
accuracy; and which therefore are in some degree amenable to treatment by scientific
machinery. An opening is made for the methods and the tests of science as soon as the
force of a person's motives—not the motives themselves—can be approximately
measured by the sum of money, which he will just give up in order to secure a desired
satisfaction; or again by the sum which is just required to induce him to undergo a
certain fatigue.
It is essential to note that the economist does not claim to measure any affection of the
mind in itself, or directly; but only indirectly through its effect. No one can compare
and measure accurately against one another even his own mental states at different
times: and no one can measure the mental states of another at all except indirectly and
conjecturally by their effects. Of course various affections belong to man's higher
nature and others to his lower, and are thus different in kind. But, even if we confine
our attention to mere physical pleasures and pains of the same kind, we find that they
can only be compared indirectly by their effects. In fact, even this comparison is
PLL v6.0 (generated September, 2011)

necessarily to some extent conjectural, unless they occur to the same person at the
same time.
For instance the pleasures which two persons derive from smoking cannot be directly
compared: nor can even those which the same person derives from it at different
times. But if we find a man in doubt whether to spend a few pence on a cigar, or a cup
of tea, or on riding home instead of walking home, then we may follow ordinary
usage, and say that he expects from them equal pleasures.
If then we wish to compare even physical gratifications, we must do it not directly,
but indirectly by the incentives which they afford to action. If the desires to secure
either of two pleasures will induce people in similar circumstances each to do just an
hour's extra work, or will induce men in the same rank of life and with the same
means each to pay a shilling for it; we then may say that those pleasures are equal for
our purposes, because the desires for them are equally strong incentives to action for
persons under similar conditions.
Thus measuring a mental state, as men do in ordinary life, by its motor-force or the
incentive which it affords to action, no new difficulty is introduced by the fact that
some of the motives of which we have to take account belong to man's higher nature,
and others to his lower.
For suppose that the person, whom we saw doubting between several little
gratifications for himself, had thought after a while of a poor invalid whom he would
pass on his way home; and had spent some time in making up his mind whether he
would choose a physical gratification for himself, or would do a kindly act and rejoice
in another's joy. As his desires turned now towards the one, now the other, there
would be change in the quality of his mental states; and the philosopher is bound to
study the nature of the change.
But the economist studies mental states rather through their manifestations than in
themselves; and if he finds they afford evenly balanced incentives to action, he treats
them primâ facie as for his purpose equal. He follows indeed in a more patient and
thoughtful way, and with greater precautions, what everybody is always doing every
day in ordinary life. He does not attempt to weigh the real value of the higher
affections of our nature against those of our lower: he does not balance the love for
virtue against the desire for agreeable food. He estimates the incentives to action by
their effects just in the same way as people do in common life. He follows the course
of ordinary conversation, differing from it only in taking more precautions to make
clear the limits of his knowledge as he goes. He reaches his provisional conclusions
by observations of men in general under given conditions without attempting to
fathom the mental and spiritual characteristics of individuals. But he does not ignore
the mental and spiritual side of life. On the contrary, even for the narrower uses of
economic studies, it is important to know whether the desires which prevail are such
as will help to build up a strong and righteous character. And in the broader uses of
those studies, when they are being applied to practical problems, the economist, like
every one else, must concern himself with the ultimate aims of man, and take account
of differences in real value between gratifications that are equally powerful incentives
PLL v6.0 (generated September, 2011)
15
http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/1676Online Library of Liberty: Principles of Economics (8th ed.)
to action and have therefore equal economic measures. A study of these measures is
only the starting-point of economics: but it is the starting-point5 .
§ 2. There are several other limitations of the measurement of motive by money to be
discussed. The first of these arises from the necessity of taking account of the
variations in the amount of pleasure, or other satisfaction, represented by the same
sum of money to different persons and under different circumstances.
A shilling may measure a greater pleasure (or other satisfaction) at one time than at
another even for the same person; because money may be more plentiful with him, or
because his sensibility may vary6 . And persons whose antecedents are similar, and
who are outwardly like one another, are often affected in very different ways by
similar events. When, for instance, a band of city school children are sent out for a
day's holiday in the country, it is probable that no two of them derive from it
enjoyment exactly the same in kind, or equal in intensity. The same surgical operation
causes different amounts of pain to different people. Of two parents who are, so far as
we can tell, equally affectionate, one will suffer much more than the other from the
loss of a favourite son. Some who are not very sensitive generally are yet specially
susceptible to particular kinds of pleasure and pain; while differences in nature and
education make one man's total capacity for pleasure or pain much greater than
another's.
It would therefore not be safe to say that any two men with the same income derive
equal benefit from its use; or that they would suffer equal pain from the same
diminution of it. Although when a tax of £1 is taken from each of two persons having
an income of £300 a-year, each will give up that £1 worth of pleasure (or other
satisfaction) which he can most easily part with, i.e. each will give up what is
measured to him by just £1; yet the intensities of the satisfaction given up may not be
nearly equal.
Nevertheless, if we take averages sufficiently broad to cause the personal peculiarities
of individuals to counterbalance one another, the money which people of equal
incomes will give to obtain a benefit or avoid an injury is a good measure of the
benefit or injury. If there are a thousand persons living in Sheffield, and another
thousand in Leeds, each with about £100 a-year, and a tax of £1 is levied on all of
them; we may be sure that the loss of pleasure or other injury which the tax will cause
in Sheffield is of about equal importance with that which it will cause in Leeds: and
anything that increased all the incomes by £1 would give command over equivalent
pleasures and other benefits in the two towns. This probability becomes greater still if
all of them are adult males engaged in the same trade; and therefore presumably
somewhat similar in sensibility and temperament, in taste and education. Nor is the
probability much diminished, if we take the family as our unit, and compare the loss
of pleasure that results from diminishing by £1 the income of each of a thousand
families with incomes of £100 a-year in the two places.
Next we must take account of the fact that a stronger incentive will be required to
induce a person to pay a given price for anything if he is poor than if he is rich. A
shilling is the measure of less pleasure, or satisfaction of any kind, to a rich man than
PLL v6.0 (generated September, 2011)
16
http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/1676Online Library of Liberty: Principles of Economics (8th ed.)
to a poor one. A rich man in doubt whether to spend a shilling on a single cigar, is
weighing against one another smaller pleasures than a poor man, who is doubting
whether to spend a shilling on a supply of tobacco that will last him for a month. The
clerk with £100 a-year will walk to business in a much heavier rain than the clerk with
£300 a-year; for the cost of a ride by tram or omnibus measures a greater benefit to
the poorer man than to the richer. If the poorer man spends the money, he will suffer
more from the want of it afterwards than the richer would. The benefit that is
measured in the poorer man's mind by the cost is greater than that measured by it in
the richer man's mind.
But this source of error also is lessened when we are able to consider the actions and
the motives of large groups of people. If we know, for instance, that a bank failure has
taken £200,000 from the people of Leeds and £100,000 from those of Sheffield, we
may fairly assume that the suffering caused in Leeds has been about twice as great as
in Sheffield; unless indeed we have some special reason for believing that the
shareholders of the bank in the one town were a richer class than those in the other; or
that the loss of employment caused by it pressed in uneven proportions on the
working classes in the two towns.
By far the greater number of the events with which economics deals affect in about
equal proportions all the different classes of society; so that if the money measures of
the happiness caused by two events are equal, it is reasonable and in accordance with
common usage to regard the amounts of the happiness in the two cases as equivalent.
And, further, as money is likely to be turned to the higher uses of life in about equal
proportions, by any two large groups of people taken without special bias from any
two parts of the western world, there is even some primâ facie probability that equal
additions to their material resources will make about equal additions to the fullness of
life, and the true progress of the human race.
§ 3. To pass to another point. When we speak of the measurement of desire by the
action to which it forms the incentive, it is not to be supposed that we assume every
action to be deliberate, and the outcome of calculation. For in this, as in every other
respect, economics takes man just as he is in ordinary life: and in ordinary life people
do not weigh beforehand the results of every action, whether the impulses to it come
from their higher nature or their lower7 .
Now the side of life with which economics is specially concerned is that in which
man's conduct is most deliberate, and in which he most often reckons up the
advantages and disadvantages of any particular action before he enters on it. And
further it is that side of his life in which, when he does follow habit and custom, and
proceeds for the moment without calculation, the habits and customs themselves are
most nearly sure to have arisen from a close and careful watching the advantages and
disadvantages of different courses of conduct. There will not in general have been any
formal reckoning up of two sides of a balance-sheet: but men going home from their
day's work, or in their social meetings, will have said to one another, "It did not
answer to do this, it would have been better to do that," and so on. What makes one
course answer better than another, will not necessarily be a selfish gain, nor any
material gain; and it will often have been argued that "though this or that plan saved a
PLL v6.0 (generated September, 2011)

http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/1676Online Library of Liberty: Principles of Economics (8th ed.)
little trouble or a little money, yet it was not fair to others," and "it made one look
mean," or "it made one feel mean."
It is true that when a habit or a custom, which has grown up under one set of
conditions, influences action under other conditions, there is so far no exact relation
between the effort and the end which is attained by it. In backward countries there are
still many habits and customs similar to those that lead a beaver in confinement to
build himself a dam; they are full of suggestiveness to the historian, and must be
reckoned with by the legislator. But in business matters in the modern world such
habits quickly die away.
Thus then the most systematic part of people's lives is generally that by which they
earn their living. The work of all those engaged in any one occupation can be
carefully observed; general statements can be made about it, and tested by comparison
with the results of other observations; and numerical estimates can be framed as to the
amount of money or general purchasing power that is required to supply a sufficient
motive for them.
The unwillingness to postpone enjoyment, and thus to save for future use, is measured
by the interest on accumulated wealth which just affords a sufficient incentive to save
for the future. This measurement presents however some special difficulties, the study
of which must be postponed.
§ 4. Here, as elsewhere, we must bear in mind that the desire to make money does not
itself necessarily proceed from motives of a low order, even when it is to be spent on
oneself. Money is a means towards ends, and if the ends are noble, the desire for the
means is not ignoble. The lad who works hard and saves all he can, in order to be able
to pay his way afterwards at a University, is eager for money; but his eagerness is not
ignoble. In short, money is general purchasing power, and is sought as a means to all
kinds of ends, high as well as low, spiritual as well as material8 .
Thus though it is true that "money" or "general purchasing power" or "command over
material wealth," is the centre around which economic science clusters; this is so, not
because money or material wealth is regarded as the main aim of human effort, nor
even as affording the main subject-matter for the study of the economist, but because
in this world of ours it is the one convenient means of measuring human motive on a
large scale. If the older economists had made this clear, they would have escaped
many grievous misrepresentations; and the splendid teachings of Carlyle and Ruskin
as to the right aims of human endeavour and the right uses of wealth, would not then
have been marred by bitter attacks on economics, based on the mistaken belief that
that science had no concern with any motive except the selfish desire for wealth, or
even that it inculcated a policy of sordid selfishness9 .
Again, when the motive to a man's action is spoken of as supplied by the money
which he will earn, it is not meant that his mind is closed to all other considerations
save those of gain. For even the most purely business relations of life assume honesty
and good faith; while many of them take for granted, if not generosity, yet at least the
absence of meanness, and the pride which every honest man takes in acquitting
PLL v6.0 (generated September, 2011)
18

himself well. Again, much of the work by which people earn their living is
pleasurable in itself; and there is truth in the contention of socialists that more of it
might be made so. Indeed even business work, that seems at first sight unattractive,
often yields a great pleasure by offering scope for the exercise of men's faculties, and
for their instincts of emulation and of power. For just as a racehorse or an athlete
strains every nerve to get in advance of his competitors, and delights in the strain; so a
manufacturer or a trader is often stimulated much more by the hope of victory over
his rivals than by the desire to add something to his fortune10 .
§ 5. It has indeed always been the practice of economists to take careful account of all
the advantages which attract people generally towards an occupation, whether they
appear in a money form or not. Other things being equal, people will prefer an
occupation in which they do not need to soil their hands, in which they enjoy a good
social position, and so on; and since these advantages affect, not indeed every one
exactly in the same way, but most people in nearly the same way, their attractive force
can be estimated and measured by the money wages to which they are regarded as
equivalent.
Again, the desire to earn the approval, to avoid the contempt of those around one is a
stimulus to action which often works with some sort of uniformity in any class of
persons at a given time and place; though local and temporary conditions influence
greatly not only the intensity of the desire for approval, but also the range of persons
whose approval is desired. A professional man, for instance, or an artisan will be very
sensitive to the approval or disapproval of those in the same occupation, and care little
for that of other people; and there are many economic problems, the discussion of
which would be altogether unreal, if care were not taken to watch the direction and to
estimate pretty closely the force of motives such as these.
As there may be a taint of selfishness in a man's desire to do what seems likely to
benefit his fellow-workers, so there may be an element of personal pride in his desire
that his family should prosper during his life and after it. But still the family affections
generally are so pure a form of altruism, that their action might have shown little
semblance of regularity, had it not been for the uniformity in the family relations
themselves. As it is, their action is fairly regular; and it has always been fully
reckoned with by economists, especially in relation to the distribution of the family
income between its various members, the expenses of preparing children for their
future career, and the accumulation of wealth to be enjoyed after the death of him by
whom it has been earned.
It is then not the want of will but the want of power, that prevents economists from
reckoning in the action of motives such as these; and they welcome the fact that some
kinds of philanthropic action can be described in statistical returns, and can to a
certain extent be reduced to law, if sufficiently broad averages are taken. For indeed
there is scarcely any motive so fitful and irregular, but that some law with regard to it
can be detected by the aid of wide and patient observation. It would perhaps be
possible even now to predict with tolerable closeness the subscriptions that a
population of a hundred thousand Englishmen of average wealth will give to support
hospitals and chapels and missions; and, in so far as this can be done, there is a basis
PLL v6.0 (generated September, 2011)
19
http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/1676Online Library of Liberty: Principles of Economics (8th ed.)
for an economic discussion of supply and demand with reference to the services of
hospital nurses, missionaries and other religious ministers. It will however probably
be always true that the greater part of those actions, which are due to a feeling of duty
and love of one's neighbour, cannot be classed, reduced to law and measured; and it is
for this reason, and not because they are not based on self-interest, that the machinery
of economics cannot be brought to bear on them.
§ 6. Perhaps the earlier English economists confined their attention too much to the
motives of individual action. But in fact economists, like all other students of social
science, are concerned with individuals chiefly as members of the social organism. As
a cathedral is something more than the stones of which it is made, as a person is
something more than a series of thoughts and feelings, so the life of society is
something more than the sum of the lives of its individual members. It is true that the
action of the whole is made up of that of its constituent parts; and that in most
economic problems the best starting-point is to be found in the motives that affect the
individual, regarded not indeed as an isolated atom, but as a member of some
particular trade or industrial group; but it is also true, as German writers have well
urged, that economics has a great and an increasing concern in motives connected
with the collective ownership of property, and the collective pursuit of important
aims. The growing earnestness of the age, the growing intelligence of the mass of the
people, and the growing power of the telegraph, the press, and other means of
communication are ever widening the scope of collective action for the public good;
and these changes, together with the spread of the co-operative movement, and other
kinds of voluntary association are growing up under the influence of various motives
besides that of pecuniary gain: they are ever opening to the economist new
opportunities of measuring motives whose action it had seemed impossible to reduce
to any sort of law.
But in fact the variety of motives, the difficulties of measuring them, and the manner
of overcoming those difficulties are among the chief subjects with which we shall be
occupied in this treatise. Almost every point touched in the present chapter will need
to be discussed in fuller detail with reference to some one or more of the leading
problems of economics.

§ 7. To conclude provisionally: economists study the actions of individuals, but study
them in relation to social rather than individual life; and therefore concern themselves
but little with personal peculiarities of temper and character. They watch carefully the
conduct of a whole class of people, sometimes the whole of a nation, sometimes only
those living in a certain district, more often those engaged in some particular trade at
some time and place: and by the aid of statistics, or in other ways, they ascertain how
much money on the average the members of the particular group, they are watching,
are just willing to pay as the price of a certain thing which they desire, or how much
must be offered to them to induce them to undergo a certain effort or abstinence that
they dislike. The measurement of motive thus obtained is not indeed perfectly
accurate; for if it were, economics would rank with the most advanced of the physical
sciences; and not, as it actually does, with the least advanced.

But yet the measurement is accurate enough to enable experienced persons to forecast
fairly well the extent of the results that will follow from changes in which motives of
this kind are chiefly concerned. Thus, for instance, they can estimate very closely the
payment that will be required to produce an adequate supply of labour of any grade,
from the lowest to the highest, for a new trade which it is proposed to start in any
place. When they visit a factory of a kind that they have never seen before, they can
tell within a shilling or two a week what any particular worker is earning, by merely
observing how far his is a skilled occupation and what strain it involves on his
physical, mental and moral faculties. And they can predict with tolerable certainty
what rise of price will result from a given diminution of the supply of a certain thing,
and how that increased price will react on the supply.
And, starting from simple considerations of this kind, economists go on to analyse the
causes which govern the local distribution of different kinds of industry, the terms on
which people living in distant places exchange their goods with one another, and so
on: and they can explain and predict the ways in which fluctuations of credit will
affect foreign trade; or again the extent to which the burden of a tax will be shifted
from those on whom it is levied, on to those for whose wants they cater; and so on.
In all this they deal with man as he is: not with an abstract or "economic" man; but a
man of flesh and blood. They deal with a man who is largely influenced by egoistic
motives in his business life to a great extent with reference to them; but who is also
neither above vanity and recklessness, nor below delight in doing his work well for its
own sake, or in sacrificing himself for the good of his family, his neighbours, or his
country; a man who is not below the love of a virtuous life for its own sake. They deal
with man as he is: but being concerned chiefly with those aspects of life in which the
action of motive is so regular that it can be predicted, and the estimate of the motor-
forces can be verified by results, they have established their work on a scientific basis.
For in the first place, they deal with facts which can be observed, and quantities which
can be measured and recorded; so that when differences of opinion arise with regard
to them, the differences can be brought to the test of public and well-established
records; and thus science obtains a solid basis on which to work. In the second place,
the problems, which are grouped as economic, because they relate specially to man's
conduct under the influence of motives that are measurable by a money price, are
found to make a fairly homogeneous group. Of course they have a great deal of
subject-matter in common: that is obvious from the nature of the case. But, though not
so obvious à priori, it will also be found to be true that there is a fundamental unity of
form underlying all the chief of them; and that in consequence, by studying them
together, the same kind of economy is gained, as by sending a single postman to
deliver all the letters in a certain street, instead of each one entrusting his letters to a
separate messenger. For the analyses and organized processes of reasoning that are
wanted for any one group of them, will be found generally useful for other groups.
The less then we trouble ourselves with scholastic inquiries as to whether a certain
consideration comes within the scope of economics, the better. If the matter is
important let us take account of it as far as we can. If it is one as to which there exist
divergent opinions, such as cannot be brought to the test of exact and well-ascertained knowledge; if it is one on which the general machinery of economic analysis and
reasoning cannot get any grip, then let us leave it aside in our purely economic
studies. But let us do so simply because the attempt to include it would lessen the
certainty and the exactness of our economic knowledge without any commensurate
gain; and remembering always that some sort of account of it must be taken by our
ethical instincts and our common sense, when they as ultimate arbiters come to apply
to practical issues the knowledge obtained and arranged by economics and other
sciences.
