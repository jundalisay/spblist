Among the Chinese population of the 4 prefectures, the clan name Li is very common. 

At the present time, many descended from the Li who have the Wang surname. 

In 1174, the head of the wild Li of the Wu-chi-shan, Wang-Chung-Ki, gathered the neighboring 80 Li villages with a population of 1,820 adult males for submitting to China. 

Chung-ki and the various chiefs, in all 81 men, went to Kiung-chou to present themselves and bound themselves by an oath taken in the Hien-ying-miau by stone-rubbing and blood-drinking to give up misdoing and desist from rapine and acts of violence.

The Prefect of Kiung-chou arranged  drawings of their outward appearance and clothing which were submitted to the Viceroy. It showed the natives who wore their hair in a knot uncovered, wrapped the lower part of the knot with red silk, or wrapped the hair entirely in coloured silk, or else they wore little
ornamented bamboo hats. All of them wore 2 silver combs stuck in their hair. 

Some of them wore a short embroidered skirt. Wang Chung-ki was further distinguishable by a blue turban and a long red silk brocade gown, bound round with a girdle.

He himself said that this was a brocade gown which one of his ancestors received from the Emperor for having ceded a piece of land to the Chinese Government in 1119-1126.




Its products are also found in foreign lands. The difference is in their quality.

Its gharu-wood from Kiung far surpass those from foreign lands by the quality and strength of their perfume. 

Those from South Vietnam and Chonla India are not to be compared with them. 

On the other hand, Hainan's yellow wax is nothing compared to that of Sumatra. It is even inferior to that of the Visayas. 

Its other prodcts are mostly like those of foreign lands, with the exception of betel-nuts
and cotton which are extraordinarily plentiful. 

The Cantonese traders look principally to cotton as a profitable article.
