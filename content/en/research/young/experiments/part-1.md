for the intervalappropriateto the disappearanceof the brightest
light; and it may be inferred that if they had been wholly
exempted from its effects, the measure would have been some-
what smaller. Now the analogous interval, deduced from the
experiments of NEWTONon thin plates, is .oooo 12, which is
about one-eighth less than the former,result; and this appears
to be a coincidence fully sufficientto authorise us to attribute
these two classes of phenotnena to the same cause. It is very
easily shown, with respect to the colours of thin plates, that
each kind of light disappears and reappears, where the diffe-
relices of the routes of two of its portions are in arithtnetical
progression; and we have seen that the same law may be in
general inferred from the phenomena of diffracted light, even
independently of the analogy.
The distributionof the colours is also so similar in both cases,
as to point immediately to a similarity in the causes. In the
thirteenth observrationof the second part of the first book,
NEWTONrelates, that the interval of the glasses where the rings
appearedin red light, was to the interval where they appeared
in violet light, as 14 to 9; and, in the eleventh observationof
the third book, that the distances between the fringes, under the
same circumstanoes,were the 22d and 27th of an,inch. Hence,
deducting the breadth of the hair, and takiig the squares, in
order to find the relationof the differenceof tnie routes,we have
the proportionof 14 to 04 which scarcely-diffIrs from the pro-
portion observed in the colours of th~ethin plate.
We Imay readily determine,from this general pri'nci)e, the
form of the crested fringes of GRIMALDI, alreadydescribed1;for
it Willappear that, under the circuinstances of the experimeutr
related, the points in which the differencesof the lengths of the

stantquantity,and in which, therefore,-thesamekindsof light
ought to appearor disappear,are always found in equilateral
hyperbolas,of which the axes coincidewith the outlinesof the
shadow,andthe asymptotesnearlywith the diagonalline. Such,
therefore,must be the directionof the fringes, and this con-k
clusionagreesperfectlywiththe observation.But it mustbe re-
marked,-thatthe partsnearthe outlinesof the shadow,are so
Muchshadedof, as to renderthe characterof the curve some-
what less decidedlymarkedwhere it approachesto its axis.
These fringeshavea slightresemblanceto the,hyperbolicfringes
observedby NEWTON; but the analogyis only-distant.
III. APPLICATION TO THE SUPERNU4MERARY RAINBOWS.
The repetitionsof colours sometimes observedwithin the
commonrainbow,and describedin the PhilosophicalTransac-
tions, by Dr. LANGWITH and Mr. DAVAL, admit also a very easy
and completeexplanationfromthe same principles. Dr. PEM-
BERTON has attemptedto point out an analogybetweenthese
colours and those of thin plates; but the irregularreflection'
from the posteriorsurfaceof the drop,to which alone he attri-
butesthe appearance,mustbe fartoo weakto produceanyvisible
effects. In orderto understandthe phenomenon,we have only
to attendto the two 1portionsof light which are exhibitedin the
commondiagramsexplanatoryof the rainbow,regularlyreflected
from the posteriorsurfaceof the drop,and crossingeach other
in various.directicns, till, at the angle of the greatest deviation,
they coincide with each other, so as to produce, by the greater
intensity of this redoubled light, the common rainbow of 41
degrees. Other paers of these two portions will quit the drop
relative to physical Optis. 9
in directionsparallel to each other; and these would exhibit a
continued diffusion of fainter light, for ,S5 within the bright
terminationwhich forms the rainbow, but for the general law
of interference,which, as in other similar cases, divides the light
into concentric rings; the mnagnitudeof these rings depending
on that of the drop, according to the differenceof time occupied
in the passageof the two portions,which thus proceedin parallel
directions to the spectator'seye, after having been differently
refractedand reflected within the drop. This difference varies
at first, nearly as the square of the angular distance from the
primitive rainbow: and, if the first additionalred be at the dis-
tance of 2?from the red of the rainbow, so as to interferea little
with the primitive violet, the fourth additional'red will be at a
distance of nearly 2' more ; and the intermediate colours will
occupy a space nearly equal to the original rainbow. In order
to producethis effect, the dropsmust be about 7- of an inch, or
.013, in diameter: it would be sufficientif they were between
6 and A. The reason that such supernumerarycolours are-
not often seen, must be, that it does not often happen that drops
so nearly equal are found together: but, that this may some-
times happen, is not in itself at all improbable: we measure
even medicines by droppingthem from a phial,and it may easily
be conceived that the drops formed by natural operationsmay
sometimes be as uniformas any that-can be produced by art.
How accuratelythis theory coincides with the observation,may
best be determined from Dr. LANGWITH'S 'Own words.

From a considerationof the nature of the secondaryrainbow,
of 5 ,fit may be inferred, that if any such supernumerary colours
were seen attending this rainbow, they would necessarily be
external to it, instead of internal. The circles sometimes seen
encompassingthe observer'sshadow in a mist, are perhapsmore
nearly related to the common colours of thin plates as seen by
reflection.
IV. ARGUMENTATIVE INFERENCE RESPECTING THE NATURE Or
LIGHT.
The experiment of GRIMALDI, on the crested fringes within
the shadow, together with several others of his observations,
equally important,has been left unnoticed by NEWTON. Those
who are attachedto the NEWTONIAN theory of light, or to the
hypotheses of modern opticians, founded on views still less en-
larged, would. do well to endeavour to imagine any thing like
an explanation of these experiments, derived from their own
doctrines; and, if they fail in the attempt, to refrain at least
from idle declamation against a system which is foUndedon the
accuracy of its applicationto all these facts, and to a thousand
others of a similar nature.
From the experimentsand calculations which have been pre-
mised, we may be allowed to infer, that homogeneous light, at
certain equal distances in the directionof its motion, is possessed
of opposite qualities, capableof neutralisingor destroying each

for thesamelight, passingthroughthe samemedium.Fromthe
agreementof the measures,and fromthe similarityof the phe-
nomena,vwemay conclude,that 'theseintervalsare the sameas
are concernedin the productionof the colours of thin plates;
but these are shown,by the experimentsof NEWTON, to be the
smaller,the denserthe medium; andd,sinceit maybe presumed
that theirnumbermust necessarilyremainunalteredin a given
quantityof light, it follows of course, that light moves more
slowly in a denser, than ih a rarer medium; and this being
granted, it mnuLstbe allowed, that refraction is not the effct of
an attractiveforcedirectedto a densermedium. The advocates
for the projectilehypothesisof light, must considerwhichlink
in this chainof reasoningthey mayjudge to be the-mostfeeble;
for, hitherto?I have advancedin this Paper no general hypo-=
thesis whatever. But, since we know that sound divergesin
concentricsuperficies,and that musicalsoundsconsistof oppo--
site qualities,capableof neutralisingeach other,and succeeding
at certainequal intervals,which are differentaccordingto the
differenceof the note, we are fully authorisedto conclude,that
theremust be some strong resemblancebetweenthe natureof
soundand that of light.
I have not, in the course of these investigations,foundany
reasonto supposethe presenceof such an inflectingmediumin
the neighbourhoodof dense substancesas I was formerlyin-
clinedto attributeto them; and, upon consideringthe pheno-
mena of the aberrationof the stars, I am-disposedto believe,

scribedthem.
V. REMARKSON THECOLOURSOF NATURALBODIES*
Exper. . I havealreadyadduced,in illustrationof NEWTON'S
comparisonof the colours of naturalbodies with those of thin
plates, Dr. WOLLASTON'S observationson the blue light of the
lower part of a candle, which appears,when; viewed through
a prism, to be divided into five portions. I have lately observed
a similar instance, still 'more strongly marked, in the light
transmittedby the blue glass sold by the opticians. This light is
separatedby the prism -intoseven distinct portions,nearly equal
in magnitude,but somewhat broader,and less accuratelydefined,
towards the violet end of the spectrum. The first two are red,
the third is yellowish green, the fourth green, the fifth blue, the
sixth bluish violet, and the seventh violet. This division agrees
very nearly with that of the light reflected by a plate of air 6
of an inch in thickness, corresponding to the i th series of red
and the 18th of violet. A similar plate of a metallic oxide, would
perhaps be about - of an inch in thickness. But it must be
confessed, that there are strong reasons fur believing the colour-
ing particles of natural bodies in general to be incomparably
smaller than this; and it is probable that the analogy, suggested
by NEWTON, is somewhat less close than he imagined. The
light reflected by a plate of air, at any thickness nearly corre-
sponding to the 1ith red, appears to the eye to be very nearly
white; but, under favourablecircumstances,the iith red and
the neighbouringcolours may still be distinguished. The light
of some kinds of colouredglass is pure red; that of others, red
with a littlegreen: some interceptall the light, except the extreme
relative tophysical Optics.
red and the blue. In the blue light of a candle,expandedby
the prism,the portionsof each colourappearto be narrower,
and the interveningdark spaces wider, than in the analogous
spectrumderivedfrom the light reflectedfrom a thin plate.
The light of burningalcoholappearsto be green and viclict
only. The pink dye sold in the shops,which is a preparation
of the carthamus,affordsa good specimenof a yellow green
light regularlyreflected,and a crimsonprobablyproducedby
transmission.
VI. EXPERIMENT ON THE DARK RAYS OF RITTER.
Exper.6. The existenceof solar rays accompanyinglight,
more refrangiblethan the violet rays, and cognisableby their
chemicaleffects,was first ascertainedby Mr. RITTER: but Dr.
WOLLASTON made the same experimentsa very short time after-
wards,without having been informedof what leadbeen done
on the Continent.Theseraysappearto extendbeyondthe violet
rays of the prismaticspectrum, through a space nearly equal to
that which is occupiedby the violet. In orderto completethe
comparisonof their propertieswith those of visiblelight, I was
desirousof examiningthe effect of their reflectionfrom a thin
plate of air, capableof producingthe well known rings of colours.
For this purpose, I formed an image of? the rings, by means of
-thesolar microscope,with the apparatuswhich I have described
in the Journals of the Royal Institution,and I threw this hMnage
on paper dippedin a solution of nitrate of silver, placed at the
distanceof aboutnine inchesfrom the microscope. In the course
of an hour, portions of three dark rings were very distinctly
visible, much smaller than the brightest rings of the coloured
image, and coincidingvery nearly, in their dimensions,with the
i6 Dr. YOUNG'SExperimentsand Calculations,&c.
-ringsof violetlight thatappeareduponthe interpositionof violet
glass. I thoughtthe darkrings were a little smallerthan the
violet rings,but the differencewas not sufficientlygreat to be
accuratelyascertained.;-it might be as muchas. or T'oof the
diameters, but not greater. It is the lessI surprising that the
differenceshould be so small, as the dimensions of the coloured
rings do not by any meansvary at the violet end of the spec-s
trum,so rapidlyas at the red end. For performingthis experi-
ment with very greataccuracy,a heliostatewouldbe necessary,
since the motionof the sun causesa slight change in the place
of the image; and leather,impregnatedwith the muriateof
silver,wouldindicatethe effectwith greaterdelicacy .The ex-
periment,however,in its presentstate, is sufficientto complete
the analogyof the invisiblewith the visiblerays, and to show
that they are equally liable to the general law which is the
principalsubjectof this Paper., If we had-thermometerssuffi.-
ciently delicate,it is probablethat we mightacquire,by similar
means, informationstill more interesting,with respect to the
rays of invisibleheat discoveredby Dr. HERSCHEL; but at pre-
sent thereis greatreasonto doubtof the practicabilityof such
an experiment
