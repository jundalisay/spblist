<!-- IV. Of The Difference Between Analytical and Synthetical Judgements. -->

The judgements of subject to predicate is from a relation created in 2 ways: 

 <!-- is cogitated (I mention affirmative judgements only here; the application to negative will be very easy), this relation is possible in two different ways. -->

1. The predicate `B` belongs to the subject `A`

This is passive-thinking [analytical judgement] and is explicative.

 <!-- as somewhat which is contained (though covertly) in the conception A; or -->

Passive-thinking happens when the predicate is connected to the subject through identity.

<!-- Analytical judgements (affirmative) are those in which the connection of the predicate with the subject is cogitated  -->

<!-- This adds in the predicate nothing to the conception of the subject, but only analyse it into its constituent conceptions, which were thought already in the subject, although in a confused manner;  -->

<!-- an analytical judgement are extended-->
"All bodies occupy space" is passive-thinking because:
- I do not need to go beyond the idea of body to find extension connected with it.
- I merely need to become conscious of the many properties in that idea-subject to discover this predicate in it.

<!-- which I think in that conception, in order to  -->
<!-- analyse the conception or -->

2. The predicate `B` lies completely out of the subject `A` but is connected with it

This is active-connective-thinking [synthetical judgement] and is augmentative. 
<!-- -->

These are not connected by identity.

 <!-- in which this connection is cogitated without , are called synthetical judgements.  -->

<!-- This adds to our conceptions of the subject a predicate which was not contained in it, and which no analysis could ever have discovered therein.  -->

In "All bodies are heavy" the predicate is something totally different from the idea of a body. 

<!-- that which I think in the mere conception of a body. By  -->

The addition of the predicate makes it require active-connective-thinking. [because heavy is not inherent in a body, but space is]

<!-- , therefore, it becomes a synthetical judgement. -->

Judgements of experience, as such, are always of active-thinking. 

<!-- synthetical.  -->

Passive-thinking cannot be groundied on experience.

This is because in passive-thinking, I do not need to go out of the ideas in my mind. 

 <!--  are extended sphere of my conceptions, and therefore recourse to the testimony of experience is quite unnecessary.  empirical  -->

"Bodies occupy space" is not a sense-based judgement. It is a within-the-mind proposition.

This is because, I already have all the ideas needed for that idea.*

{{< n n="That idea came from experience and so Kant is false" >}}

<!-- in my conception all the requisite conditions for the judgement, and  -->

I only need to extract the predicate or sub ideas from the main idea. I could never do this from experience.

 <!-- conception, according to the principle of contradiction, and thereby at the same time become conscious of the necessity of the judgement, a necessity which I could never learn from experience.  -->

My main idea of body does not have inherently the sub ideas of weight. The idea of weight in a body is an effect of experience which lets me add more ideas to the idea of a body. 

<!-- On the other hand, though at first I do not at all include the predicate of weight in my conception of body in general, that conception still indicates an object of experience, a part of the totality of experience, to which I can still add other parts;  -->

This is from observing that bodies are heavy.

I can add ideas of extension, impenetrability, shape, etc.

This adds to my knowledge. 

From this, I can make the main idea: "All bodies are heavy."

<!-- all which are cogitated in this conception. But now I extend my knowledge, and looking back on experience from which I had derived this conception of body, I find weight at all times connected with the above characteristics, and therefore I synthetically add to my conceptions this as a predicate, and say, "All bodies are heavy." Thus it is experience upon which rests the possibility of the synthesis of the predicate of weight with the conception of body, because both conceptions, although the one is not contained in the other, still belong to one another (only contingently, however), as parts of a whole, namely, of experience, which is itself a synthesis of intuitions. -->


 <!-- to synthetical judgements a priori, -->
But for active-connective-thinking within-the-mind, such aid is entirely wanting.

I can think of idea `B` being connected to idea `A`. But what more can I say about them?

<!-- If I go out of and beyond the conception A, in order to recognize another B as connected with it, what foundation have I to rest on, whereby to render the synthesis possible?  -->

<!-- I have here no longer the advantage of looking out in the sphere of experience for what I want. Let us take,  -->

For example, "Everything that happens has a cause." 

In the idea "something that happens" I think an existence from which I can derive ideas from passive-thinking. 

<!-- which a certain time antecedes, and from this I can derive analytical judgements. conception   conception conception-->

But the active-connective-thinking of a cause lies quite out of the above idea. The idea of cause indicates something entirely different from "that which happens," and is consequently not contained in that idea [of effect]. 

The general idea of effect [that which happens] is entirely different from effect. 

That cause is unknown, but is connected to the idea of effect. 


<!-- How then am I able to assert concerning the general conception—"that which happens"—something entirely different from that conception, and to recognize the conception of cause although not contained in it, yet as belonging to it, and even necessarily? 

What is here the unknown = X, upon which the understanding rests when it believes it has found, out of the conception A a foreign predicate B, which it nevertheless considers to be connected with it?  -->


The principle in "Everything that happens has a cause" connects cause with effect [everything] universally and relationally. 

Therefore, it is completely within-the-mind and from pure conceptions.*

{{< n n="In Yogic science, the realization of the cause of everything is called samadhi and is an experience from the 6th sense or the heart chakra. The cause cannot be produced intellectually. This destroys Kant's whole work even before it starts" >}}

<!-- It cannot be experience, because the principle adduced annexes the two representations, cause and effect, to the representation existence, not only with universality, which experience cannot give, but also with the expression of necessity, therefore  -->


 <!-- synthetical analytical  conceptions -->
The aim of our speculative within-the-mind knowledge depends on such active-thinking augmentative propositions.

Passive-thinking judgements are highly important and necessary.

But its goal is only to arrive at that clearness of ideas needed for a sure and extended synthesis of ideas.

<!-- , and this alone is a real acquisition. -->
