### 6. The Universal Problem of Pure Reason

<!-- It is extremely advantageous to be able to bring a number of investigations under the formula of a single problem. 

For in this manner, we not only facilitate our own labour, inasmuch as we define it clearly to ourselves, but also render it more easy for others to decide whether we have done justice to our undertaking.  -->

The proper problem of pure reason is: "How are active-connective-thinking judgements within-the-mind possible?"

This great problem is why metaphysics has been in uncertainty and contradiction*.

{{< n n="The contradiction is from the difference between the higher and lower minds, as an effect of the Positive Force fightng the Negative" >}}

 <!-- science has hitherto remained in so vacillating a state of , is only to be attributed to the fact that , and perhaps even the difference between analytical and synthetical judgements, did not sooner suggest itself to philosophers.  -->


The rise or fall of Metaphysics depends on solving or not solving this problem.*  

{{< n n="This is solved by Superphysics" >}}

<!-- Upon the solution of this problem, or upon sufficient proof of the impossibility of synthetical knowledge a priori, depends the existence or downfall of the science of .  -->

David Hume came the nearest of all to this problem.
- But he was not precise nor universal.

He stopped short at the active-connective-thinking proposition of cause and effect by insisting that that was impossible within-the-mind. 

<!--  the connection of an effect with its cause (principium causalitatis), insisting that such proposition a priori was impossible. 
 According to his conclusions, then, all that we term  -->

It follows that Metaphysics is a mere delusion.*
- It arises from the fancied insight of reason into that which is sense-based. 

{{< n n="This is opposite of our conclusion. Hume's maxim is that mentality creates reality. And so it would propel metaphysics to popularity and utility. But for some reason, later writers who read Hume made the opposite conclusion as what Kant did. And so they kill metaphysics instead of making it grow leaps and bounds" >}}


This destroys all pure philosophy.

But I am different because I focus on imposition [of within-the-mind ideas onto reality]. 
- This is proven by pure mathematics, something that Hume did not think of.

<!-- in truth borrowed from experience, and to which habit has given the appearance of necessity. Against this assertion, destructive to all pure philosophy, he would have been guarded, had he had our problem before his eyes in its universality. For he would then have perceived that, according to his own argument, there likewise could not be any pure mathematical science, which assuredly cannot exist without synthetical propositions a priori—an absurdity from which his good understanding must have saved him. -->


I aim to use pure mental abstractions as the foundation for the construction of all sciences which contain theoretical within-the-mind knowledge of objects.

<!-- , that is to say, the answer to the following questions:

To solve problem of pure reason 

In the solution of the above problem is at the same time comprehended the possibility of the use of pure reason 

as the foundation and construction of all sciences which contain theoretical knowledge a priori of objects, that is to say, the answer to the following questions: -->

How is pure [abstract] mathematical science possible?

How is pure [abstract] natural science possible?

<!-- Respecting these sciences, as they do certainly exist, it may with propriety be asked, how they are possible?—for that they must be possible is shown by the fact of their really existing.* But as to metaphysics, the miserable progress it has hitherto made, and the fact that of no one system yet brought forward, far as regards its true aim, can it be said that this science really exists, leaves any one at liberty to doubt with reason the very possibility of its existence.

     [*Footnote: As to the existence of pure natural science, or
     physics, perhaps many may still express doubts. But we have
     only to look at the different propositions which are
     commonly treated of at the commencement of proper
     (empirical) physical science—those, for example, relating
     to the permanence of the same quantity of matter, the vis
     inertiae, the equality of action and reaction, etc.—to be
     soon convinced that they form a science of pure physics
     (physica pura, or rationalis), which well deserves to be
     separately exposed as a special science, in its whole
     extent, whether that be great or confined.] -->

<!-- Yet, in a certain sense, this kind of knowledge must unquestionably be looked upon as given; in other words, metaphysics must be considered as really existing, if not as a science, nevertheless as a natural disposition of the human mind (metaphysica naturalis). For human reason, without any instigations imputable to the mere vanity of great knowledge, unceasingly progresses, urged on by its own feeling of need, towards such questions as cannot be answered by any empirical application of reason, or principles derived therefrom; and so there has ever really existed in every man some system of metaphysics. It will always exist, so soon as reason awakes to the exercise of its power of speculation. And now the question arises: "How is metaphysics, as a natural disposition, possible?" In other words,  -->


How, from the nature of universal human reason, do those questions arise which pure reason proposes to itself, and which it is impelled by its own feeling of need to answer as well as it can?

Questions such as "did the world have a beginning? or has existed from eternity?" have been answered with contradictions. 

We must not stick with metaphysics for this. 

But how is metaphysics possible as a science?

<!-- But as in all the attempts hitherto made to answer the questions which reason is prompted by its very nature to propose to itself, for example, whether the world had a beginning, or has existed from eternity, it has always met with unavoidable contradictions, we must not rest satisfied with the mere natural disposition of the mind to metaphysics, that is, with the existence of the faculty of pure reason, whence, indeed, some sort of metaphysical system always arises; but it must be possible to arrive at certainty in regard to the question whether we know or do not know the things of which metaphysics treats. We must be able to arrive at a decision on the subjects of its questions, or on the ability or inability of reason to form any judgement respecting them; and therefore either to extend with confidence the bounds of our pure reason, or to set strictly defined and safe limits to its action. This last question, which arises out of the above universal problem, would properly run thus: "How is metaphysics possible as a science?" -->

Thus, the critique of reason leads naturally and necessarily to science.

<!-- The dogmatical use of reason without criticism leads to groundless assertions, against which others equally specious can always be set, thus ending unavoidably in scepticism.

Besides, this science cannot be of great and formidable prolixity, because it has not to do with objects of reason, the variety of which is inexhaustible, but merely with Reason herself and her problems; problems which arise out of her own bosom, and are not proposed to her by the nature of outward things, but by her own nature. 

And when once Reason has previously become able completely to understand her own power in regard to objects which she meets with in experience, it will be easy to determine securely the extent and limits of her attempted application to objects beyond the confines of experience.

We may and must, therefore, regard the attempts hitherto made to establish metaphysical science dogmatically as non-existent. For what of analysis, that is, mere dissection of conceptions, is contained in one or other, is not the aim of, but only a preparation for metaphysics proper, which has for its object the extension, by means of synthesis, of our a priori knowledge. And for this purpose, mere analysis is of course useless, because it only shows what is contained in these conceptions, but not how we arrive, a priori, at them; and this it is her duty to show, in order to be able afterwards to determine their valid use in regard to all objects of experience, to all knowledge in general. But little self-denial, indeed, is needed to give up these pretensions, seeing the undeniable, and in the dogmatic mode of procedure, inevitable contradictions of Reason with herself, have long since ruined the reputation of every system of metaphysics that has appeared up to this time. It will require more firmness to remain undeterred by difficulty from within, and opposition from without, from endeavouring, by a method quite opposed to all those hitherto followed, to further the growth and fruitfulness of a science indispensable to human reason—a science from which every branch it has borne may be cut away, but whose roots remain indestructible.
