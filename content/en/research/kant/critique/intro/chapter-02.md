### 2. The Human Intellect Has Cognitions within-the-mind

<!-- "a priori". -->

How do we distinguish a pure from an empirical cognition?

<!-- Experience no doubt teaches us that this or that object is constituted in such and such a manner, but not that it could not possibly exist otherwise. Now, in the first place, if we have  -->

<!-- necessity -->
A within-the-mind proposition has cause and effect in its very conception.

An absolutely within-the-mind proposition is not derived from any other proposition.

<!-- empirical, unless from one equally involving the idea of necessity, it is absolutely priori.  -->

An experience-based judgement is never strict and absolute. It only has an assumed and comparative universality (by induction).

<!-- therefore, the most we can say is—so far as we have hitherto observed, there is no exception to this or that rule.  -->

A judgement is strictly and absolutely universal if it admits of no possible exception.

This is only possible if it is not derived from experience, but is absolutely within-the-mind.*

{{< n n="Kant actually goes into the realm of ideas which are perfect in themselves" >}}


### Real World Universality Versus Within-the-mind Universality

<!-- Empirical -->
Experience-based universality is, therefore, only an arbitrary extension of validity.

This extension creates valid propositions in most cases even if it is asserted that the proposition is valid in all. 

<!-- , to that which is asserted of a proposition which holds good in all;  -->

For example, in the affirmation, "All bodies are heavy." 

On the contrary, strict universality comes from judgements from within-the-mind.

<!-- , it necessarily indicates another peculiar source of knowledge, namely, a faculty of cognition a priori.  -->

<!-- Necessity and strict universality, therefore, are  -->

The infallible test for distinguishing within-the-mind knowledge and real-world knowledge is:
- imposability
- relationality

 <!-- universal cause and effect. -->

<!-- pure from empirical knowledge, and are inseparably connected with each other.  cause and effect -->

When we use relation:
- it is easier to detect real world limitations.  
- we are more convinced by the biases within-our-minds than relations to other ideas

<!-- cause and effect -->

This is why we should separate the relationality and imposability of our own ideas.

<!-- cause and effect and universality  -->

<!-- But as in the use of these criteria the empirical  is sometimes more easily detected than the contingency of the judgement, or the unlimited universality which we attach to a judgement is often a more convincing proof than its necessity, it may be advisable to use the criteria separately, each being by itself infallible. -->


We have judgements that are related yet are imposable. 

<!-- cause and effect, yet are universal to us.  -->

<!-- Now, that in the sphere of human cognition we have judgements which are necessary, and in the strictest sense universal, consequently pure a priori, it will be an easy matter to show.  -->

<!-- If we desire an example from the sciences, we need only take any proposition in mathematics. If we cast our eyes upon the commonest operations of the understanding, the proposition, -->

An example is "Every change must have a cause."

The idea of a cause involves the connected idea of an effect.

This is strictly imposable to all [universal].

<!-- of the law, that the very notion of a cause would entirely disappear, were we to derive it, like Hume, from a frequent association of what happens with that which precedes; and the habit thence originating of connecting representations—the necessity inherent in the judgement being therefore merely subjective. 

Besides, without seeking for such examples of principles existing a priori in cognition, we might easily show that such principles are the indispensable basis of the possibility of experience itself, and consequently prove their existence a priori. 

For whence could our experience itself acquire certainty, if all the rules on which it depends were themselves empirical, and consequently fortuitous? 

No one, therefore, can admit the validity of the use of such rules as first principles. -->

 <!-- pure a priori -->
I establish these facts:

1. We have a faculty of absolutely within-the-mind cognition.

2. Its proper tests are tendency-of-mind-to-impose-on-others and relation

<!-- cause-and-effect.  -->

<!-- universality and necessity. -->

A within-the-mind origin is manifest in judgements and ideas. 

<!-- conceptions, is an a priori origin .  -->

For example, we can remove all the physical attributes of a thing so that its body vanishes. But the space which it occupied still remains.*

{{< n n="Classically, this was called extension or metaphysical space" >}}

 <!-- if we take away by degrees from our conceptions of a body all that can be referred to mere sensuous experience—colour, hardness or softness, weight, even impenetrability—the body will then vanish;  -->

It is utterly impossible to eliminate this space in our minds. This space is the substance of that object in our minds.*

{{< n n="In yogic science, this substance is the citta which takes the form of the object" >}}

<!-- This space is  to annihilate in thought. Again, if we take away, in like manner, from our empirical conception of any object, corporeal or incorporeal, all properties which mere experience has taught us to connect with it, still we cannot think away those through which we cogitate it as substance, or adhering to substance, although our conception of substance is more determined than that of an object.  -->

This substance is has its seat in our within-the-mind faculty of cognition.
 
<!-- Compelled, therefore, by that necessity with which the conception of substance forces itself upon us, we must confess that it  a priori -->
