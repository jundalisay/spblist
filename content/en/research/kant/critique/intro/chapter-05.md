### 5. All Theoretical Sciences of the Abstract Mind Have Principles Based on Active-thinking Within-the-mind 

<!-- Synthetical Judgements "a priori" are contained as Principles. -->

1. Mathematical judgements are always active-connective-thinking.

 <!-- synthetical. -->

<!-- Hitherto this fact, though incontestably true and very important in its consequences, seems to have escaped the analysts of the human mind, nay, to be in complete opposition to all their conjectures.

For as it was found that a synthetical -->

Mathematical conclusions all proceed according to the principle of contradiction.

 <!-- (which the nature of every apodeictic certainty requires), people became persuaded that the fundamental principles of the science also were recognized and admitted in the same way. But the notion is fallacious; empirical for although  -->

An active-connective-thinking proposition can be discerned through contradiction.

But this is possible only when it is preceded by another active-thinking proposition, from which the other is deduced, but never of itself.

Proper mathematical propositions are always within-the-mind judgements.

They are not sense-based because they carry with them the idea of cause-effect which cannot be given by experience.

 <!-- conception of necessity,  If this be demurred to, it matters not; I will then limit my assertion to pure mathematics, the very conception of which implies that it consists of knowledge altogether non-empirical and a priori. -->

<!-- We might, indeed at first suppose that the proposition analytical -->

`7 + 5 = 12` might be a merely passive proposition.

 <!-- following (according to the principle of contradiction) from the conception of a sum of seven and five.  -->

But if we regard it more narrowly, we find that our conception of the sum of 7 + 5 contains only the uniting of both sums into one. 

whereby it cannot at all be cogitated what this single number is which embraces both.

The idea of 12 is not obtained by merely thinking of the union of 7 and 5.

<!-- ; and we may analyse our conception of such a possible sum as long as we will, still we shall never discover in it the notion of twelve.  passivelyuse our pass and have recourse to an intuition-->

We must go beyond these ideas, and imagine our 5 fingers* and then, by one by one, add the idea of 7.

{{< n n="But seeing the fingers is sense-based. So this refutes Kant's entire argument that mathematics is a priori" >}}

Finally, I see see the number 12 arise.

<!-- , for example, or like Segner in his Arithmetic five points, and so by degrees, add the units contained in the five given in the intuition, to the conception of seven. For I first take the number 7, and, for the conception of 5 calling in the aid of the fingers of my hand as objects of intuition, I add the units, which I before took together to make up the number 5, gradually now by means of the material image my hand, to the number 7, and by this process, I at length  That 7 should be added to 5, I have certainly cogitated in my conception of a sum = 7 + 5, but not that this sum was equal to 12. -->

Arithmetical propositions are therefore always active-connective-thinking. This is more easily proven by large numbers.* 

{{< n n="It is more obvious in large numbers because human memory is limited and so it needs more mental energy to create the ideas of large numbers." >}}

 <!-- synthetical, of which we may become more clearly convinced by trying large numbers.  -->

<!-- For it will thus become quite evident that, turn and twist our conceptions as we may, it is impossible, without having recourse to intuition, to arrive at the sum total or product by means of the mere analysis of our conceptions. Just as little is any principle of pure geometry analytical.  -->


 <!-- synthetical -->
"A straight line between 2 points is the shortest" is an active-thinking proposition. 

The idea of straight is qualitative, not quantitative. 

The idea of the shortest is therefore wholly an addition. Passive-thinking will not lead to an idea of a straight line from a shortest line.

<!--  is not implied by 

by no analysis can it be extracted from our conception of a . Intuition -->

Passive-knowing must here help for us to combine the idea that the shortest line is straight.

 <!-- line lend its aid, by means of which, and thus only, our synthesis is possible.analytical, -->

Some few principles preposited by geometricians:
- are really active-thinking
- depend on the principle of contradiction.

They serve like identical propositions linking in the chain of method, not as principles—for example, a = a, the whole is equal to itself, or (a+b) —> a, the whole is greater than its part.

These principles derive their validity from pure ideas. Yet they are only admitted in mathematics because they can be presented passively. 

<!-- -thiinkingintuition. -->

What causes us here commonly to believe that 

We tend to think that:
- the predicate of such apodeictic judgements is already in our minds.
- therefore, the judgement is passive.*

{{< n n="Some math and geometry can be passively rendered from memory." >}}

 <!-- therefore analytical,  -->

But this wrong idea is merely the equivocal nature of the expression.

We must join in thought a predicate to a given conception.
- This necessity cleaves already to the conception. 

We really actively-think about this [idea that comes passively] obscurely. 

<!-- But the question is, not what we must join in thought to the given conception, but what we really think therein, though only obscurely, and  -->

Then it becomes manifest that the predicate necessarily is actively-connected to these ideas by passive knowing. 

<!-- ,  indeed, yet not as thought in the conception itself, but by virtue of an intuition, which must be added to the conception. -->


<!-- The science of natural philosophy  synthetical -->

2. Physics contains in itself within-the-mind active-thinking judgements as principles.

Two examples are:
- The Conservation of Matter
- Newton's Third Law

<!-- "In all changes of the material world, the quantity of matter remains unchanged"

 or, that, "In all communication of motion, action and reaction must always be equal."  necessity, and therefore their origin  synthetical -->

Both of these:
- are active-thinking propositions yet conceived within-the-mind
- have the relation, as cause and effect, clear within-the-mind 

The idea of matter does not include its permanence, but merely its presence in the space which it fills.

I therefore really go beyond the idea of matter, in order to think on to it something a priori, which I did not think in it. 

<!-- The proposition is therefore not analytical, but synthetical, and nevertheless conceived a priori; and so it is with regard to the other propositions of the pure part of natural philosophy. analytically-->


3. Metaphysics has active-thinking propositions within-the-mind

<!-- , even if we look upon it merely as an attempted science, yet, from the nature of human reason, an indispensable one, we find that it must contain synthetical propositions a priori. It is not merely the duty of  -->

Metaphysics dissects and thereby passively illustrates the ideas which we form of things within-the-mind. 

But we seek to widen the range of our within-the-mind knowledge.

This is why must use principles that add something to the original idea through active-connective-thinking within-the-mind beyond the limits of experience. 

For example, in the proposition, "the world must have a beginning" and such like.

Thus metaphysics only has active-connective-thinking within-the-mind propositions.
