{{< n n="We replace a priori with confined-to-mind, conceptions with active knowings, and intuition with passive knowing" >}}
 <!-- a priori -->
<!-- The only  is that of 

Space and time are -->

The pure form of phenomena is space and time.
- This is the only passive-knowing confined-to-mind 

<!-- intuition -->

<!--conception a priori -->

An active-knowing of space and time as quanta may be presented within-the-mind passively. It can be constructed:
- alone with their quality (figure) or
- as number
  - This is the mere synthesis of the homogeneous 

Number is pure quantity. 

The matter of phenomena happens in space and time. 
- This can be presented only in perception, a posteriori. 

 <!-- conception  a priori  empirical  conception confined-to-mind-->
<!-- The only active-knowing which represents this sense-based content of phenomena is the active-knowing of a thing in general. -->

The only idea which represents the sensory-content of the phenomena is the idea of the thing in general. 

 <!-- a priori  synthetical  conception  a posteriori -->

The idea of the thing in general is:
- confined-to-mind
- a product of active-thinking

The idea of the thing in general:
- gives us the rule for the synthesis of the ideas which may be contained in the corresponding sense-based perception.
- is utterly inadequate to give a confined-to-mind passive-knowing of the real object.

<!-- The   cognition of this idea only  -->
<!-- , which must necessarily be empirical. -->

Active-thinking propositions which relate to things in general, of which confined-to-mind passive-knowings are impossible, are transcendental.

 <!-- an a priori intuition of which ,   -->

<!-- Synthetical propositions,  -->

This is why transcendental propositions:
- cannot be framed through the construction of active-knowings. 
- are confined-to-mind
- based entirely on ideas themselves

<!--  conceptions
 conceptions; they are a priori, and .  -->


Transcendental propositions contain merely the rule of how we are to seek in the real world the active-thinking unity of things which cannot be passively-known within the mind.

<!-- intuited a priori.

 synthetical unity of that  -->

Transcendental propositions cannot present any of the conceptions which appear in them in a passive-knowing confined-to-mind.

 <!-- a priori intuition. synthetical-->

These can be given only by experience.

This expereince is possible only through these active-knowing principles.

To form an active-knowing judgement of an idea, we must go beyond it to the passive-knowing that gives it.

 <!-- intuition in which it is given.  analytical -->


The judgement is merely passive if it keeps to what is contained in the idea.
- In this case, it is merely an explanation of that idea. 

<!-- what we have cogitated in the conception.  -->

But I can go from the idea to the abstract or real passive-knowing that it comes from. 

 <!-- pure or empirical intuition which corresponds to it.  -->

I can proceed to examine my conception in concreto, and to cognize, either a priori or a posterio, what I find in the object of the conception. 

Confined-to-mind cognition is rational.
- It becomes a mathematical cognition through the construction of the idea.

External-mind cognition is purely a sense-based cognition.

It does not have relation and imposition. 

<!-- necessity and universality.  -->

Thus I may analyse the idea of gold.

But I gain no new information from this analysis.

I merely enumerate the different properties connected with the notion of gold.

 <!-- indicated by the word. -->

<!-- My knowledge has gained in logical clearness and arrangement, but no addition has been made to it.  -->

But if I take real gold and examine it with my senses, I can create several active-mind propositions, though sense-based.

  <!-- synthetical—although still empirical—.  -->

I can passively create a mathematical idea of a triangle confined-to-mind. In this way, I attain rational-active-knowing.

<!-- synthetical cognition.  -->

But when the transcendental active-knowing of anything is presented to my mind, it does not indicate either a sensory or abstract passive-knowing.

<!-- conception of reality, or substance, or power is  -->

 <!-- empirical or pure intuition, synthesis-->

Instead, it indicates merely the active-thinking of senory passive-knowings which cannot be given confined-to-mind.

 <!-- empirical intuitions,  -->

 <!-- a priori.  -->

The synthesis in such an idea cannot proceed within-the-mind without the aid of experience—to the intuition which corresponds to the conception; 

 <!-- synthetical -->
This is why none of these active-knowings can produce a determinative active-thinking proposition. 

They can never present more than a principle of the synthesis* of possible sense-based passive-knowings. 

 <!-- empirical intuitions. synthetical  -->

A transcendental proposition is, therefore, an active cognition of reason by means of pure ideas and the discursive method.

<!-- synthetical  empirical -->

It renders possible all active unity in sense-based cognition, though it cannot present us with any passive-knowings confined-to-mind. 

<!-- intuition a priori. -->

[*Footnote: In the case of the conception of cause, I do really go beyond the empirical conception of an event—but not to the intuition which presents this conception in concreto, but only to the
time-conditions, which may be found in experience to correspond to
the conception. My procedure is, therefore, strictly according to
conceptions; I cannot in a case of this kind employ the construction of
conceptions, because the conception is merely a rule for the synthesis
of perceptions, which are not pure intuitions, and which, therefore,
cannot be given a priori.]
