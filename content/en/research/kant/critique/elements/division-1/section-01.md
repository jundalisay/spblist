### 2. Metaphysical Exposition of this Conception

Our external senses give our minds the representation of external objects as being in space. 
- These give us their shape, dimensions, and relations to each other

<!-- By means of the external sense (a property of the mind), we represent to ourselves objects as without us, and these all in space.  -->

The mind uses the internal sense to contemplates itself or its internal state.

<!-- , gives, indeed, no intuition of the soul as an object. -->

Yet the contemplation of our internal state gives a determinate form which relates the inward determinations of the mind to time.  

<!-- , under which alone  is possible, so that all which relates to  the mind is represented in relations of time.  -->

We cannot have any external intuition of time and of space.

<!-- , any more than we can have an internal intuition of space.  -->

What then are time and space? Are they real existences?

<!-- Or, are they merely relations or determinations of things, such, however, as would equally belong to these things in themselves, though they should never become objects of intuition; or, are they such as belong only to the form of intuition, and consequently to the subjective constitution of the mind, without which these predicates of time and space could not be attached to any object? -->

<!-- In order to become informed on these points, we shall first give an exposition of the conception of space. By exposition, I mean the clear, though not detailed, representation of that which belongs to a conception; and an exposition is metaphysical when it contains that which represents the conception as given a priori. -->


1. Space is not an idea derived from outward experiences*

This is because the idea of space must already exist as a foundation so that my sensations can relate to something outside of me, as being in a different location than me. 

 <!-- without me (that is, to something which occupies a different part of space from that in which I am);  -->

<!-- in like manner, in order that I may represent them not merely as without, of, and near to each other, but also in separate places, .  representation be borrowed from the relations of -->

Consequently, the idea of space cannot come from  external phenomena through experience.

On the contrary, this external experience of space is only possible through my inherent idea of space. 

{{< n n="This is totally wrong. Space is an inferior Element to the Aether in the 5 Elements model. Kant is merely siding with the idea of abstract space versus the phenomena of physical space. This is to empower his arbitrary transcendental system. This is proven when he uses abstract geometry as the basis of space" >}}

<!-- the said antecedent representation. -->


2. Space then is a necessary withn-the-mind idea.

 <!-- representation a priori, -->

It serves as the foundation of all external intuitions.

We never can imagine the non-existence of space.*

{{< n n="This is alredy possible with point-particles. It is possible to imagine spacelessness. But it is impossible to think of non-identity because doing so with lead to non-existence i.e. the point-particle has identity, but no space" >}}


<!-- though we may easily enough think that no objects are found in it. It must, therefore, be considered as the condition of the possibility of phenomena, and by no means as a determination dependent on them, and is a representation a priori, which necessarily supplies the basis for external phenomena. -->


3. Space is no discursive or general conception of the relations of things, but a pure intuition.

For, in the first place, we can only represent to ourselves one space, and, when we talk of divers spaces, we mean only parts of one and the same space. Moreover, these parts cannot antecede this one all-embracing space, as the component parts from which the aggregate can be made up, but can be cogitated only as existing in it.

Space is essentially one, and multiplicity in it, consequently the general notion of spaces, of this or that space, depends solely upon limitations. Hence it follows that an a priori intuition (which is not empirical) lies at the root of all our conceptions of space.

Thus, moreover, the principles of geometryâ€”for example, that "in a triangle, two sides together are greater than the third," are never deduced from general conceptions of line and triangle, but from intuition, and this a priori, with apodeictic certainty.


4. Space is represented as an infinite given quantity. 

Every idea is a representation contained in an infinite multitude of different possible representations.

But an idea cannot have within itself an infinite multitude of representations.

<!-- , which, therefore, comprises these under itself; but no conception, as such, can be so conceived, as if it 

contained within itself   -->

Nevertheless, space is so conceived of, for all parts of space are equally capable of being produced to infinity. 

Consequently, the original representation of space is passive-knowing within the mind, not active-knowing.

 <!-- intuition a priori, and not a conception. -->
