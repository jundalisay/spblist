## CHAP. XI. Parallels.

In parallel circles the same strength and equal power are perceived everywhere, when various magneticks are placed on one and the same parallel either on the earth or on a terrella. For they are distant from the poles by equal intervals and have equal tendencies of declination, and they are attracted and held, and they come together with like forces; just as those regions which are situated under the same parallel, even if they differ in longitude, yet we say possess the same quantity of daylight and a climate equally tempered.



## CHAP. XII. The Magnetick Horizon

Horizon is the name given to the great circle, separating the things which are seen from those which are not seen; so that a half part of the heaven always is open and easily seen by us, half is always hidden. This seems so to us on account of the great distance of the star-bearing orbe: yet the difference is as great as may arise from the ratio of the semi-diameter of the earth compared with the semi-diameter of the starry heaven, which difference is in fact not perceived by our senses. We maintain, however, that the magnetick horizon is a plane level throughout touching the earth or a terrella in the place of some one region, with which plane the semi-diameter, whether of the earth or of the terrella, produced to the place of the region, makes right angles on every side. Such a plane is to be considered in the earth itself and also in the terrella, for magnetick proofs and demonstrations. For we consider the bodies themselves only, not the general appearances of the world. Therefore not with the idea of outlook (which varies with the elevations of the lands), but taking it as a plane which makes equal angles with the perpendicular, we accept in magnetick demonstrations a sensible horizon or boundary, not that which is called by Astronomers the rational horizon.


## CHAP. XIII. The Axis and Magnetick Poles.

Let the line be called the axis which is drawn in the earth (as in a terrella) through the centre to the poles. They are called πόλοι by the Greeks from πολεῖν, to turn, and by the Latins they are also called Cardines or Vertices; because the world rotates and is perpetually carried around them. We are about to show, indeed, that the earth and a terrella are turned about them by a magnetick influence. One of them in the earth, which looks towards the Cynosure, is called Boreal and Arctic; the other one, opposite to this, is called Austral and Antarctic. Nor do these also exist on the earth or on a terrella for the sake of the turning merely; but they are also limits of direction and position, both as respects destined districts of the world, and also for correct turnings among themselves.
