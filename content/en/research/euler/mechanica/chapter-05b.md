PROPOSITION 79. PROBLEM.

641. With the attraction from the centre of the forces in the ratio of the distances from C,
a body is projected from M with some speed and following some direction MT; it is
required to determine the ellipse on which the body is moving.

SOLUTION.

The solution of this problem can be
understood from this, that the number of
those given is not very large for the ellipse
to be determined, as will become apparent.
The radius CM = y, the sine of the angle
CMT = s, with the total sine equal to 1, and
with the height corresponding to the speed at
M equal to v, also the distance from the
centre C, at which the centripetal force is
equal to the force of gravity remains equal to
f. These quantities are therefore considered
to be given and known; truly unknown and
to be found are the axes of the ellipse and
the position of these; [p. 263] of these
required, put AC = a and CD = b, and hence b = 2cf (631).
With these put in place, it is found at once that 2 fv = a 2 + b 2 − y 2 (632), and hence
a 2 + b 2 = AD 2 = 2 fv + y 2 ;
therefore with the subtangent of AD now known equal to the distance CE determining the
speeds. Then also there is found (635) :

and from which there arises :
ab = sy 2 fv .
With these combined together, there arises :

Truly 1 − 2s is the cosine of twice the angle CMT, that we call i. Hence we have
a 2 − b 2 = ( 4 f 2v 2 + y 4 + 4 fviy 2 ) .
From these equations there comes about :
a 2 = fv + 12 y 2 + ( f 2v 2 + 14 y 4 + fviy 2 ) and
b 2 = fv + 12 y 2 − ( f 2v 2 + 14 y 4 + fviy 2 ) .
Truly with the axis found, the position of these can be easily found. For indeed the

642. Therefore, wherever the body is projected and whatever the speed and the direction,
the body moves around the perimeter of an ellipse, the centre of which is the centre of
force.

643. Up to this stage, a central force proportional to the distance and attracting has been
put in place; but in a like manner the curves described are found, [p. 264] if the force
from the centre repels the bodies in the same ratio. For everything in the preceding
arguments can be adapted, if – f is written in place of f . Truly with this curve made,
which before was an ellipse, is now changed into a hyperbola, with the minor axis made
imaginary, and the centre of force remaining at the centre of the hyperbola.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

PROBLEM.
644. If the centripetal force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance and
the body is projected with a given speed from A (Fig. 57) with a given speed in a
direction normal to the radius AC, it is required to determine the curve AMDBHA, that
the body describes, and the motion itself along this curve.
SOLUTION.
As before with AC = a and with the speed at A corresponding to the height c, f is the
distance at which the centripetal force is equal to the force of gravity. Then put CM = y,
and the perpendicular CT, that is sent to the
tangent, is equal to p , and the height
corresponding to the speed at M is equal to v.

C + u ( A − q ) = q (1 − u ) .
In which by making u = 1 and q =

gives C = 0. Consequently we have :

or
( f 2 − 2ac )u = 2a 2cq = f 2 − 2ay c .

Since u = xy , this becomes ( f 2 − 2ac )x = f 2 − 2a 2c and
f 4 y 2 = 4a 4c 2 + 4a 2cx( f 2 − 2ac ) + ( f 2 − 2ac )2 x 2 .
Calling the line PM = z, then
f 4 z 2 = 4a 4c 2 + 4a 2cx( f 2 − 2ac ) − 4acf 2 x 2 + 4a 2c 2 x 2 .

given by CG =
2 a 2 c − af 2
, which is equal to half the distance between the focal points. For
2 f 2 − 2ac
this reason the centre of force C has been put in one of the focal points of the ellipse.
It is therefore apparent that the body projected from A with a speed c describes the
ellipse AMDBHA about the centre C, of which one focus is placed at C.

645. The distance determining the speeds CE is found equal to

648. If c = 2a , the ellipse becomes a circle; for the transverse and conjugate axis become

Truly with the ratio of the diameter to the periphery set equal to 1 : π , the area of the

Corollary 10.
654. Therefore if there are several bodies revolving around the centre of force, attracted
in the inverse square of the distances, the periodic times are to each other as the three on
two ratio of the transverse axes of the ellipses. [p. 268]
Corollary 11.
655. If the initial speed at A vanishes, the ellipse turns into the right line AC. Therefore
the body continually moves on this straight line between A and C, and hence suddenly
changes direction again and is returned to A, thus in order that the body never reaches a
point beyond the centre C (272). [Assuming elastic collisions at C.]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Corollary 2.
658. Since neither the transverse axis nor the latus rectum can become imaginary in any

659. After Kepler had shown that the planets move in ellipses, in which the sun is put in
one focus, and the times are in proportion to the areas, which straight lines drawn from
the arc to the sun are understood to describe, Newton showed that the force holding the
planets in their orbits pulling towards the sun was in the inverse square ratio of the
distances of the planets from the sun. [p. 270] This same truth follows from these two
propositions; for with the centre of force attracting in the inverse square ratio of the
distances, the bodies must be moving in ellipses or hyperbolas, the centre of force of
which falls on one or other focus.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Corollary 2.
666. [In the first edition, in place of the number 660, and those which follow, the false
numbers 666 and for those following have been written. We have decided to retain the
false numbers of the paragraphs. (Note by Paul Stackel, 1912 ed.) ]
Following Newton, the force of attraction of the sun is to the force of attraction of the
earth at the same distances from the centres of each are in the ratio 227512 to 1.
Whereby, when the force of attraction of the earth at a distance of one radius from the
centre of the earth on the surface is the gravitational force of 1, a body at a distance of
one earth radius from the centre of the sun is attracted to it by a force in turn 227512
greater than that of gravity. From which it is inferred, that if a body were at a distance of
477 earth radii, the force by which it is attracted to the sun, would be equal to the force of
gravity on the earth.
Corollary 4.
667. Therefore if the sun is put in place as the centre of force of the attraction in the
inverse ratio of the square of the distances, a distance equal to 447 earth radii must be
taken for f .
Scholium 2.
668. When these propositions can be adapted to the motion of the planets, the sun is at
C, and with the planet moving in the ellipse ADBHA, the transverse axis of which AB is
equal to E, the interfocal distance CF = D and the speed, [p. 271] that the planet has at
the greater apse A, corresponds to the height c. Hence it becomes :
Now for Mercury, E = 15991 earth radii, that here we constantly use to express
distances, D = 3367. Whereby c = 9.278. For Venus, E = 29882 and D = 206, hence it is
found that c = 7.509. For the earth, E = 41312 and D = 743. Hence, c = 5.313. For Mars,
E = 62959 and D = 5887, and thus c = 2.996. For Jupiter, E = 214870 and D = 22391,
hence, c = 0.9615. For Saturn, E = 394042 and D = 22391, hence c = 0.5153. Which are
sufficient for the absolute motion of any planet to be determined. [In the first edition, the
heights c for Mercury, Venus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn have been found to
have the incorrect values 7.368, 7.598, 5.323, 3.049, 0.9633, 0.5173. Corrected by P. St.]

669. Newton, as we have now given the nod to his works, from the known ellipse that the
body describes, and with the centre of force placed in one focus, deduced that the
centripetal force is inversely proportional to the squares of the distances. Afterwards the
inverse of this proposition was considered by the Celebrated Johan Bernoulli and others,

demonstration had been given to the inverse problem by Newton, that besides the conic
sections no other curve sought was satisfactory, although prop. XVII. of Book I, Princ.
Philos. Naturalis seems to show this clearly enough. Therefore with these two
propositions, we have shown in full the solution to this question, by which the assertion
of Newton is put in place beyond doubt. [p. 272] Although other solutions of this

PROBLEM.
671. If the centripetal force varies inversely as the cube of the distance from the centre,
the curve is required that the body describes projected in any manner, and the motion of
the body on that curve.
SOLUTION.
Let C be the centre (Fig. 58) and the body is projected from A with the speed
c and along the direction making an angle with AC, the sine of which is ah , with AC =
a. [p. 273] The body arrives at M, where CM = y and the perpendicular sent from C to the
tangent MT is CT = p. Truly the speed at M
corresponds to the height v. And the distance
from the centre C, at which the centripetal force
is equal to the force of gravity, is equal to f.
Therefore the centripetal force at is equal to

continually recedes from that, but yet the distance never goes beyond the given interval
θa . Therefore the right line parallel to this radius for each θa distance is the true
asymptote. Besides it is a property of this conspicuous curve, that equal arcs can be cut
from the curve by an infinite number of concentric circles, from which more can be

Hence it is apparent that if k = a, by making c = 0, to become u = const. = 1 and likewise
x = y, which is the case in which the body has descended to the centre. If k is infinite,
then c also is infinite, as long as n + 1 is a positive number. Therefore in this case as well,
the body must be progressing along a straight line, since a finite force acting on a body
with an infinite speed is not strong enough to change the direction of the motion.
[Thus, positive values of n lead to straight line motions to the centre.]
Therefore otherwise we put n + 1 to be a negative number = – m or n = –m – 1; and the
equation becomes :
With k made indefinitely large [i. e. the place where h = a], this becomes :
with the remainder of the terms vanishing ; and on putting y m − 2 = q 2 , then y = q m−2 .
With this substitution made, there arises the following equation :

must become equal to a. [The initial normality condition.]

Therefore, provided m is a positive rational number, an algebraic curve is found that the
body projected normally describes, with the speeds arising determined from an infinite

or since n = –m – 1, this equation
Corollary 2.
687. It is required that m is a positive number greater than zero. For if m should be equal
to 0 or a negative number, the speed of the body becomes infinite and the curve therefore
becomes a straight line.
Corollary 3.
688. If n = −2 , we have this equation: 4ya − 2 = 2u = 2yx or 2a = x + y . Which with the
vertical coordinate PM, or ( y 2 − x 2 ) , = z becomes equal to this equation:
z 2 = 4a 2 − 4ax for a parabola with the centre of force at the position of the focus, as we
have thus found. (647). [p. 283]

689. If n = −3 or m = 2, which is the case handled in the preceding proposition, then the

equation becomes : 2 y 2 = 2a 2 or y = a. Therefore the curve described by the body is
a circle, at the centre of which lies the centre of force.

these cases, the formula found for the solution of the problem is convenient to use. But if
n is an even number, the formula (686) produced by taking the squares should be used.
Indeed in each case a rational equation between x and y is immediately arrived at, as
becomes apparent in the following examples.

694. With regard to the figures that bodies describe under the action of given forces, it is
not worth the effort to add more here, as in Physics and Astronomy, the hypotheses of
centripetal forces other than those in proportion to the inverse square of the distances
have no use. Yet in Astronomy, when a body must be considered to be acted on by
several forces of this kind, of which one exercises a maximum influence on the body over
the others, these extra forces, as the problem demands, do not have to be introduced into
the calculation, as they only augment or diminish a little, that by which even the
approximate motion of the body is known. Therefore in these cases the curve the body
describes does not disagree much with an ellipse. For this reason, Astronomies usually
consider the curve to be in the form of an ellipse, however one which is not fixed, but
with movement, so that thus they consider the body revolving in an ellipse about a focus
which in turn is moving [p. 285]. From which the motions of the orbits of the planets
arise, where the lines of the apses continually move to another place. We ourselves, when
we proceed closer to the truth, besides the mobility of the axis of the ellipse, will also
consider the form of this motion as a variable. Therefore we rotate with this ellipse, so
that we can determine any element of the curve that the body describes, which is part of
the ellipse having the focus at the centre of force, from which position the nature of the
ellipse can become known. Moreover all these ellipses have their focus in turn in the
position of centre of force, by which the body is continually drawn.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

695. If the centripetal force does not disagree much with the ratio of the inverse square
with the distances, to determine the motion of the ellipse, and the continual change of the
form of the ellipse, and the change of the motion of the body associated with this change
of the ellipse.
SOLUTION.
Let C be the centre of force (Fig. 60), and
the body at M has a speed along the direction
MT corresponding to the height v. The
centripetal force acting at M is equal to P, the
distance CM = y and the sine of the angle
CMT = s. Now it is evident, as the law holds,
that P, can still always be put equal to this
form:
f2
, although f [p. 286] is not a constant
y2
quantity as before, but denotes a variable.
Therefore we have f 2 = Py 2 . Since moreover,
while the body traverses the element Mm, f can
remain constant, and the ellipse can be determined, the focus of which is C and Mm an
element, in which the body moves, if f remains the same constant. Therefore with AC put
as the transverse axis of this ellipse, the tangent of the angle MCA =

From which equation p is to be determined in terms of y and thus the whole ellipse from
only y, c and h. Now CG is the fixed line, with which the angle that it makes with the line

MCA is taken away, the inclination of the apse line AC in the fixed line CG is found.

696. The ellipse determined in this way deserves to be called the osculating curve of the
ellipse from the likeness of the circles of osculation, by which the curvatures of lines are
measured. Truly this consideration is not purely geometrical, for by finding the osculating
ellipse, besides the nature of the curve, it is also necessary to know the speed of the body
and the centripetal force.
Corollary 1.
697. If t vanishes, the line of the apses AC of the axis of the osculating ellipse falls on the
radius CM on account of the angle MCA vanishing.
Corollary 2.

698. If we put P = 2ch3 , the angle MCA is made right. Therefore in this case the

centripetal force varies inversely as the cube of the distance. Whereby with P =

701. The theory of osculating ellipses is not to be confused with the motion of bodies in
moving orbits, concerning which Newton and others after him have worked on. [Princ.
phil. nat., Book I. Section IX : De motu corporum in orbibus mobilibus, deque motu
apsidum. P. St. ] For here we have determined that some part of an ellipse is some portion
of the curve described by a body. But, when the talk is about moving orbits (729), the
centripetal force bringing about the motion is being investigated, as the body rotating
about a given centre of force is moved.
PROPOSITION 85.
THEOREM.
702. If a body projected in some way is attracted to several centres of force A, B, C (Fig.
61), of which the individual forces are proportional to the distances of the body from
these, [p. 289] then the body moves in the same manner, as if it is attracted equally by the
common centre of gravity O of the points A, B, C in the simple ratio of the distances.
DEMONSTRATION.
With the forces of the centres put at A, B, and C, and
with the forces which they exercise at unit distance put
as α , β , γ respectively, let ac be the direction of the
motion that the body has at M, and thus the tangent of
the curve EMF described at M. But O is the centre of
gravity of the bodies α , β , γ put at the points A, B, C,
and at O it is understood that the force varies directly
with the distance, which at unit distance attracts with a
force equal to α + β + γ . With these in place, a body at
M is attracted to A by the force AM .α , at B by the force
BM .β and at C by the force CM .γ . Moreover with
these forces acting together, it is requires to show that a force equal to OM .( α + β + γ )
is attracting the body towards O . In order that this can be shown, perpendiculars Aa, Bb,
Cc and Oo are sent from the points A, B, C, and O to the tangent ac. In this manner anyEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

force can be resolved into normal and tangential components, and the sum of the normals
arising from the attractions towards A, B,C is equal to :
α .Aa + β .Bb + γ .Cc ,
and the sum of the tangents is equal to :
− α .Ma + β .Mb + γ .Mc .
But since O is the centre of gravity of the bodies α , β , γ situated at A, B, C, it has been
proven from statics that :
and
From which is evident for the forces acting together that α .AM , β .BM ,γ .CM is
equivalent to the force ( α + β + γ ).OM . Q.E.D. [p. 290]
Corollary 4.
703. Therefore the body according to this hypothesis describes an ellipse, the centre of
which is placed in the centre of gravity itself O (631). For all the forces have the same
effect, that a single force placed at O and attracting in the direct ratio of the distances.
Corollary 5.
704. It is also evident, however many there are centres of this kind of force attracting in
the ratio of the distances, the body still always moves in an ellipse, and as if it is entirely
attracted by a single force at the common centre of gravity.
Scholium 1.
705. The demonstration again succeeds in an equal manner, if some number of centres of
force are not put in the same plane, as is evident from the principles of statics. Hence it is
understood that the body is nevertheless moving in the same place, even if the centres of
force are scattered in the most diverse of planes.
Scholium 2.
706. If the centres of forces are attracting in some other ratio besides the simple ratio of
the distances, a reduction of this kind to a single central position of the forces cannot be
had in a straightforward manner, and I can hardly calculate the motion of the body, nor
indeed can hardly anything be determined about the motion. [p. 291] Therefore in these
cases it is necessary to flee to approximations, which are set up in different ways
according to the various conditions. And on this account, Newton was unable to
determine the motion of the moon, which arises from two attractions, but truly this is by
far the most outstanding nearest attempt. Moreover, concerning this it is necessary to give
this problem the most singular consideration, and the inverse method has to be called
upon, where the body is receding from a known curve that it describes, under the
influence of attracting forces. On this account, we will explain in the following what aids
can be put in place, when we are to investigate the force acting as the unknown in the
inverse order. Therefore as we are progressing through this discussion, which can beEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

the curve and the motion of the body on that curve is taken as given, from which it is

Secundum Neutonum vis attrahens solis est ad vim attrahentem terrae in aequalibus ab

semidiametri suae a centro seu in superficie aequalis sit vi gravitatis 1, corpus a centro
solis semidiametrum terrestrem distans ad id trahetur vi 227512 vicibus maiore quam

vim, qua ad solem trahetur, fore aequalem vi gravitatis.

prout res postulat, ne reliquas in computum ducere opus sit, aliquantum vel augetur vel
diminuitur, quo saltem quam fieri potest proxime motus illius corporis cognoscatur. His
igitur casibus curva, quam corpus describit, non multum discrepabit ab ellipsi. Hanc ob
rem Astrononomi hanc curvam ad instar ellipsis contemplari solent, quae autem non est
fixa, sed mobilis, ita ut corpus in ellipse circa focum revolvente moveri concipiant [p.
285]. Ex hocque oritur mobilitas orbitarum planetarum, qua lineae absidum perpetuo in
alium situm transferuntur. Nos vero, quo propius ad veritatem accedamus, praeter
mobilitatem axis ellipsis etiam speciem eius tanquam variabilem considerabimus. Ita
igitur hac in re versabimur, ut de quolibet elemento curvae, quam corpus describit,
determinemus, cuiusnam ellipsis focum in centro virium habentis sit portio, ex quo tam
positio quam species istius ellipsium innotescet. Omnes autem hae ellipses alterutrum

704. Manifestum quoque est, quotcunque etiam sint huiusmodi virium centra in ratione
distantiarum attrahentia, semper tamen corpus in ellipsi motum iri, omnino ac si ad
unicum virium centrum in eorum communi centro gravitatis positum attraheretur.
Scholion 1.
705. Demonstratio porro pari quoque modo succedit, si illa quotcunque virium centra non
sint in eodem plano posita, quamadmodum ex staticis principiis cuique perspectum esse
potest. Hincque intelligitur corpus nihilominus perpetuo in eodem plane moveri debere,
etiamsi centra virium in diversissimis planis sint dispersa.
Scholion 2.
706. Si centra virium in alia ratione quacunque praeter simplicem distantiarum ad se
trahant, huiusmodi reductio ad unicum virium centrum locum prorsus non habet , atque
motus corporis calculo vix, re ipsa autem ne vix quidem potest determinari. [p. 291] His
igitur in casibus ad approximationes erit confugiendum, quae pro variis conditionibus
diversimode sunt instituendae. Atque hanc ob rem Neutonus verum lunae motum, qui ex
duplici attractione oritur, determinare non suscepit, sed vero tantum proxime hoc
praestare conatus est. Ad hoc autem opus est peculiaribus considerationibus, atque
inversa methodus est adhibenda, qua ex curva, quam corpus describit, cognita ad vires
attrahentes receditur. Quamobrem, quae subsidia ad hoc institutum afferri possunt, ea in
sequentibus, cum inverso ordine vim solicetantem tanquam incognitam sumus
