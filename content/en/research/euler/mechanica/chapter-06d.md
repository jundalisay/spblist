PROBLEM.

1063. If the curve AM is given (Fig.93), on which the body is moving, and the angular
motion about the centre of force C, to find both the centripetal force attracting the body
towards C as well as the resistance at individual places.

SOLUTION.

As before by placing CM = y, CT = p, Mm = ds, with the speed at M corresponding to the height v, the centripetal force equal to P and the resistive force equal to R, the periphery ELl of a circle is taken described with centre C and with radius EC = 1 on which the body [p. 455] is carried around C with the same angular motion C as the body is carried around the curve AM. Hence the element Ll is completed in the same time as the element Mm. Now let the speed along the element Ll correspond to the height u; and u is given, since the angular motion is given. And it is found that :

Truly we have :
Ll : mr = 1 : y or Ll = mr
, again it is the case that
y
mr : Mm = p : y and likewise mr =

Ll =

Now from this ratio found for v, it is the case that (1005) :
(1007). And if the resistance is itself put proportional to the square of the speeds, and the
exponent of the resistance is equal to q, then the exponent becomes :
Q.E.I.

Corollary 1.

1064. If the centripetal force P is proportional to
dp
, and since that happens when the
p 3 dy
body moves in a vacuum, then u varies inversely as y 4 . Whereby the angular speed then
varies inversely as the square of the distance of the body from the centre. Moreover, with
y 4u put constant, it is evident that the resistance R vanishes from the other equation.

Corollary 2.

1065. If the body approaches the centre C, thus as y decreases we have:
Whereby the resistance becomes :

From which it is understood, if y 4u is the power of this y, [p. 456] of which the exponent
is a positive number, then the resistance also becomes positive. But if the exponent of this
power of y is negative, then the resistance also is negative.
Corollary 3.

1066. If the angular motion is made uniform or u is constant, then du = 0 and likewise

Corollary 4.

1067. Let the angular speed be as the power of the exponent n of the distance y or
u=
y 2n
, then the resistance

and for the resistance of the medium in the square ratio of the speed, the exponent of the
resistance is given by :

1068. Let the curve AM again be the hyperbolic spiral expressed by the equation :
and the angular speed is as y n or as before u =
y 2n
. Moreover since
f 2 n−1
then [p. 457]
and the centripetal force
If the resistance is put proportional to the speed itself, then the exponent of the resistance
is equal to [Recall that the exponent of the resistance goes with the corresponding height
or the square of the speed] :
But on the contrary if the resistance is put proportional to the square of the speed and the
exponent of the resistance is q, then we have

PROBLEM.
1069. If the resistance is given by some power of the speed and likewise the exponent of
the resistance, also in addition the angular motion of the body about the centre C is given
(Fig.93), from these to find the curve that the body describes, and the centripetal force
pulling towards the centre C.
SOLUTION. [p.433]
On putting CM = y, CT = p, Mm = ds, with the height corresponding to the speed at
m
M equal to v, the centripetal force equal to P , the resistance R is given by R = v m ,
q
where q is given in terms of y. Then the angular motion is considered as before [p. 458]
as the motion performed by a point on the periphery of the circle ELl, the radius of which
CE = 1. Now with the speed put in place in which Ll is describes, corresponding to the
height u, we can elucidate as in the preceding proposition,
Moreover this last equation, in which u and q are given quantities, expresses the nature of the
given curve, for which we therefore have :
or
Truly from the known nature of the described curve, or from the equation between p and
y, the centripetal force becomes known at once, clearly it is

Corollary 1.
1070. If the angular speed is to become constant, which cannot happen in a vacuum
unless the body moves in a circle, then du = 0 and this produces the equation for the
curve sought :

Example 1.
1074. The medium offers resistance in the square ratio of the distances and the exponent
y
of the medium is q = α . Truly the angular motion is taken as uniform or u = b. Then m
= 1 and 4 ( y 2 − p 2 ) = αy (1070). Hence there is produced :
Whereby the curve described is a logarithmic spiral, in which the sine of the angle that
the radius makes with the tangent is

1075. The medium offers resistance in the simple ratio of the speed and that is uniform,
also the angular speed is made constant; then m = 12 , q = c , u = b. With these substituted

Because in these formulas uniformity of dimensions is not observed, the reason for is
because we have put the radius of the circle EC equal to 1. Therefore by this means
uniformity with unity is restored.

1076. There are many central forces that we do not consider in this chapter, since also in
this case as in a vacuum, hardly any can equations can be deduced in order to determine
the motion. If a certain centre of force attracts in the simple ratio of the distances, any
number greater than one have no difficulty in attracting in the simple ratio of the
distances, as we have shown above (702). And this agreement applies equally with a
resisting medium in place of the vacuum. On account of which, when now we consider
one centre of force attracting in the simple ratio of the distances, there is no need for us toEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

go through the motions of including several more of the same kind. Therefore we
progress to the case of the widest applicability, in which all the motions produced in the
same plane are dealt with. Obviously we consider two absolute forces the directions of
which are mutually perpendicular to each other, and the individual forces making up each
kind are parallel to each other. For it is agreed that any forces existing in the same plane
can be resolved into two forces of this kind. Besides in this treatment not only do we
embrace all the cases of absolute forces, but also it is allowed to observe certain special
cases concerning centripetal forces, which were barely evident in the preceding. For here
we can immediately reduce the description of the curve to an equation between the
orthogonal coordinates, because in this case the distance between the centre and the
perpendicular to the tangent has been found for any point on the curve. [p. 462]

PROBLEM.
1077. If the body at M (Fig.94) is acted on by two forces, of which the one has the
direction MP normal toe the given line AC, and the other truly has the direction MQ
parallel to AC itself or normal to BC, to determine the curve AM which the body
describes in any medium with resistance due to action of these forces.
SOLUTION.
Calling CP = MQ = x, PM = CQ = y, the element
Mm = ds; and with drawing mp and mq there is
produced Pp = – dx and Qq = dy and
ds = ( dx 2 + dy 2 ) . Let the force, by which the body
is drawn along MP be equal to P and the force, by
which the body is drawn along MQ, be equal to Q,
truly the resistance is equal to R and the speed at M
corresponds to the height v. Now the forces P and Q
are resolved into normal and tangential forces with
the help of the perpendiculars sent from P and Q to
the tangent Tt ; hence the normal force arising from P is equal to :
and the tangential force is equal to :
Truly by resolution from the force Q the tangential force is equal to :
and the normal force is equal to :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Therefore the total normal force is equal to :
and the total tangential force emerging is equal to :
which force is diminished by the resistance R, and from which total the accelerating force
produces the motion.
Hence from these with the radius of osculation at M put equal to r , it follows that

1083. Nevertheless although this equation :
is of second order differentials, yet it is more convenient than the differential equation of
the first order in determining the curves [p. 465], which the projected body describes
attracted either in the simple ratio of the distances or inversely as the square of the
distances.
For in the simple ratio there is n = 1 and 2 Bq3ddq + dp 2 = 0. On making dp = wdq; on

Hence there is obtained :

since B is a negative quantity.
Corollary 7.
1084. If n = –2 or the body is attracted in the reciprocal ratio of the distances squared, it
is in the vacuum the described curve

and on integrating again :
Of which each curve is the section of a cone; that one indeed an ellipse, yet all of these

Scholium 1.
1085. In the preceding chapter, in which we presented the motion of bodies in a vacuum,
we also determined curves which a body described with a centripetal force either
proportional to the distances or inversely proportional to the square of the distances; and
it was convenient to find these curves from these laws in the given corollaries. [p. 466]
Indeed the methods are maximally different; for there we arrived at algebraic equations
from the comparison of circular arcs, here truly by integration an algebraic equation
between the coordinates is spontaneously given. Truly this method, although it is more
convenient in the two cases already given, yet in other cases it is troubled with
difficulties. For in other hypotheses of centripetal force this method indeed is unable to
give a differential equation for the curve described, that yet can always be done with
equal ease by the other direct method to give the curve described. Yet this should be
ascribed to defective analysis rather than to the method, when we may know the integral
of the second order differentials [This is referred to as a differential of the differential
equation in the text] of the equation
that isEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

from the method used in the preceding chapter, truly we may not be able to elicit this
integral from the second order equation.
Scholium 2.
1086. The problems of reciprocal natures that can be proposed around these forces, this
has now been solved in Cor. 2, in which from a given curve, with the resistance of the
medium and the speed at individual points given also, the forces acting along MP and
MQ are sought which produce this motion. As if the curve AMB is a circle with centre at
C and having radius AC = a and the resistance is equal to vc and speed is constant, truly
v = b, then it is x 2 + y 2 = a 2 and [p. 467]
In a similar manner, since there are five things that are arrived at in the consideration :
truly the two forces P and Q, thirdly the resistance R, in the fourth place the speed at the
individual places or v, and in the fifth place the nature of the curve described or the
equation between x and y, always three of these can be taken as given and the two
remaining are to be found from these. On this account there are ten problems that can be
formed from the number of combinations, in which three are taken from five. But so that
we are not detained to any extent in working these out, and from which not much can be
deduced that is useful, we treat a single problem, in which the medium offers resistance
in the square ratio of the speed and the curve described is sought from a given centripetal
force.

PROBLEM.
1087. If a body moves in a medium that resists as the square ratio of the speed, and if the
force P is to the force Q as MP to MQ (Fig.94) or, which is the same, if the body is drawn
to the centre C by some force, to determine the curve AMB described by the body.
SOLUTION.
As before on placing CP = x, PM = y, Mm = ds and y = px, let the speed at M
correspond to the height v and the exponent of the resistance is q; that is, R = qv . And
since there is the ratio P : Q = y : x , then this gives

1092. I doubt that this second order differential equation can in any case be reduced to a
differential equation of the first order [p. 470]; or yet that which we put in place above,
where we considered the customary centripetal forces (1020). Therefore in a medium
with resistance the method of working does not yet seem to be useful, as much as it
brought in a vacuum, even for the cases in which n is either 1 or –2. On this account,
since in this matter hardly anything more can be expected, I leave the motion made in a
plane with a resisting medium, and I proceed to consider non–coplanar motion,
connecting the body with the absolute forces and the force of resistance acting on it.
Where in this business it is alright for a little easy understanding to lead to apparent
knowledge, I am content to expound the rules, from which we are able to arrive at an
equation for any proposed problem.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

PROBLEM.
1093. In a medium with some resistance acting a body is acted on by three forces, of
which one is along the tangent, and the remaining two are normal to the direction of the
body, and in two planes with the normals between each normal in turn; to determine the
motion of the body and the curve which it describes.
SOLUTION.
From the element Mm (Fig. 95) which the body
describes, from the ends M and m the perpendiculars
MQ and mq are sent, and from the points Q and q the
perpendiculars QP and qp are sent to the fixed axis
AP in the fixed plane APQ [p. 471]. Then put AP =
x, PQ = y and QM = z, with the height corresponding
to the speed at M equal to v. Now let the tangential
force be equal to T. The first of the normals , the
direction of which lies in the plane Mq, is equal to N
and the other, the direction of which is normal to the
plane Mq, is equal to M. The force of the resistance is truly equal to V. Moreover since
the force of the resistance V does not affect the normal forces, but only has a little effect
on the tangential force, the effect of the normal forces N and M remains unchanged, but
in effect the tangential force has to be defined by putting T – V in place of T. Whereby,
when we determine the effect of these forces now above (809), the same equations
prevail given there and here, if in this way T – V is put in place of T. On this account
these equations are produced for the resisting medium :
and
(809). From which with v eliminated there are two equations involving the three
coordinates x, y, z, which express the nature of the curve sought. Moreover it is assumed
that the element dx is assumed to be constant in these equations. Q.E.I. [p. 472]
Corollary 1.
1094. The two latter equations can be solved together in order that v is eliminated and
give this equation :
Which are equally valid for some medium and for a vacuum (810).EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Corollary 2.
1095. It is evident from this equation, if N or M vanishes, the motion of the body is of
such a kind. For on putting N = 0 it becomes :
Truly
dz
is the tangent of the angle, by which the element Mm is inclined to Qq.
( dx 2 + dy 2 )
Whereby this angle is constant; since QM has a given ratio to the projection BQ of the
described curve in the plane APQ.
Corollary 3.
1096. If M = 0, then ddy = 0 and thus the projection BQ is a straight line. Therefore the
total curve described by the body is put in a plane normal to the plane APQ and cutting
the line BQ.

Corollary 6.
1099. Moreover the plane, in which
the two elements Mm and mμ have
been placed (Fig. 96) which the body
describes, is determined in a like
manner to that in the vacuum, since
the determination of this plane only
depends on the coordinates x, y and z.
Truly if this plane is SMR, and it cuts
the plane APQ in the line OR, then
And the tangent of the angle that the
plane RMS constitutes with the plane

Corollary 9. [p. 474]
1102. As in corollary 1, the ratio is given between ddy and ddz for the normal forces M
and N, and if the proportionals are substituted in their place then the position of the plane
RMS is determined by a first order differential equation. But all these apply equally well
for a vacuum and for a resisting medium. Whereby also this result agrees with these that
were presented above in proposition 98 in a straightforward manner.

PROBLEM.
1103. If a body M (Fig.97) in some resisting medium is drawn by three forces, of which
the direction of one is Mf parallel to the AP, the direction of another Mg is parallel to the
applied line PQ placed in the plane APQ and the direction of the third is MQ sent
normally to the plane APQ from M, to find the motion of the body and the line that it
describes.
SOLUTIO.
As before by putting AP = x. PQ = y and QM = z
and with the speed at M corresponding to the height v,
let the force drawing along Mf be equal to P, the force
drawing along Mg be equal to Q, and the force drawing
along MQ equal to R, and the force of the resistance at
M is equal to V. These three forces can be resolved
into three others, the directions of which agree with
these in the previous proposition, [p. 475] and the
tangential force produced

and
(823). For here we use the same denominators, as with these in Proposition 99. Therefore
with these values substituted in the preceding formulas we have the following three
equations :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

and
Which three equations with v eliminated give two equations in the coordinates x, y and z,
which express the nature of the curve described. Moreover in these formulae the element
dx has been assumed constant. Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.
1104. The two last equations agree perfectly with these that we found for the vacuum
(823). Whereby the equations which follow from these have a place, as in the vacuum
case so in the resistive case. Moreover the whole distinction that lies between the motion
in the vacuum case and the motion with resistance, depends on the first equation.
Corollary 2.
1105. Moreover from the final two equations solved together there arises this ratio :
On account of which in place of second normal equation, which makes up the greater
part, this substitution can be made [p. 476]
or
which does not involve v.
Corollary 3.
1105a. With the help of this ratio
the determination of the plane RMS is found in terms of first order differentials as
follows :
the tangent of the angle POR is equal toEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

and the tangent of the angle of inclination of the plane RMS to the fixed plane RQS is
equal to
(825).
Corollary 4.
1106. If two of the forces P, Q, R vanish, the motion by necessity becomes that in a
plane. For if P and Q vanish, this makes ddy = 0 ; if P and R vanish, this makes (if Q and
R vanish, this makes ddz = 0;) dzddy = dyddz or dz = αdy. Which all indicate that the
motion lies in a plane.
Corollary 5.
1107. If P, Q and R are proportionals of x, y et z, then the body is always attracted to the
point A, and thus the motion of this body becomes that in a plane. The formulae indicate
the same; for set AO = 0. But because
then it follows that
xddy
= xdzxddz
and on integrating xdy − ydx = αxdz − αzdx.
xdy − ydx
− zdx
Whereby αddz = ddy , thus the proposal is agreed upon. [p. 477]

Corollary 6.

1108. If the force P vanishes, then the ratio becomes ddy : ddz = Q : R and
With these values P, Q and R in place in the equation, by which dv is defined, on
substitution there arises

1110. All the forces can be reduced to these three forces P, Q and R, in whatever way
they are able to be devised. On account of which, whatever problem that is proposed,
two equations can be elicited that contain the nature of the described curve[p. 478].
Truly of these one is a differential equation of the second degree, and the other a
differential equation of the third degree, if indeed the value of v found from the equation

equation :
(1108) on placing ds = ( dx 2 + dy 2 + dz 2 ) . The integral of this is
With this value substituted, there is produced :
Putting z = py; [p. 479] we have the following two equations, from which the nature of
the curves described ought to be determined,

Corollary 1.
ds ( b − x ), the element of time
1112. Since it is the case that 2 cv = dx
∫ dsv = b− x .
2dx c
Therefore the whole time, in which the body is moved horizontally along AP by the
motion, is equal to 2 c l b −b x .
Therefore the horizontal motion agrees with the motion in the same resisting medium
along the line AP with no force acting, with the initial speed at A corresponding to the
height bb : 4c.

Corollary 2.

1113. Truly neither does the motion have this special amount of time only in place if the
body is drawn along MP or if Q : R = y : z, but it always prevails if P = 0. For this
follows from (1108), in which P is put equal to zero.

Corollary 3.

1114. Therefore the progressive motion of the body along AP has been slowed down,
and it cannot go beyond the limit, which is x = b. Moreover the time taken is infinitely
great for the body to be able to reach this limit. [p. 480]
Example.

1115. We put the force by which the body is attracted to the line AP to be in proportion
to the distances MP or
Therefore in order to determine the curve we have these equations
in that equation is put y = e ∫ udx and it becomes
q
Which equation becomes separable on putting u = b − x ; for it produces
Therefore with q given and on also on account of u given in terms of x. Consequently
also y in terms of x is known, from which the projection of the curve described in the
plane APQ is obtained. Then from the given y in terms of x, also p is given in terms of x
on account of dp = αdx
2 , and likewise z in terms of x. On account of which the whole
y
curve described by the body can be constructed.

1116. If b vanishes, likewise also the progressive motion of the body along AP vanishes
and on account of this the body moves in the plane through A normally to AP and is
attracted to A in the ratio of the distances. Moreover the curve, which the body describes
in this case, can also be constructed (1027) along with the others.
