THE CURVILINEAR MOTION OF FREE POINTS ACTED ON BY ABSOLUTE FORCES OF ANY KIND.

PROBLEM.

707. To find the law of the force continually pulling downwards which can be
constructed along the lines MP (Fig. 62) parallel to each other, in order that the body
moves along a given curve AM, and to determine the speed of the body at individual
points M. [p. 292]


SOLUTION.
The normal AP is drawn through the line MP, AP is
called x, and PM y. The curve AM = s and the radius os

osculation MR at M = r, then r = ddx with ds taken as
constant. Again the speed of the body at M corresponds to
the height v, and the body force at M pulling along MP is
put as P. From these established, these two equations are
obtained : dv = − Pdy and Pr dx = 2vds (557), from
which, if v is known, then P is itself immediately apparent.
Therefore P is eliminated, and v is to be found from this

equation : rdxdv = −2vdsdy , which with r replaced by its value ddx , becomes this

Corollary 1.
708. Therefore whatever the force shall be acting, the body always progresses
horizontally uniformly on account of the time to travel along AM to be proportional to
AP itself, that has been observed above (579). [p. 293]
Corollary 2.
709. If a perpendicular is sent from R to the line MP produced RS, and from S another
perpendicular ST is sent to MR , and finally a third perpendicular TV is sent from T to MS,
3
then MV = rdx3 . Whereby the force P acting has the ratio to the force of gravity [which
ds
equals one] as 2λ2c to MV, or P is inversely as MV.
[For there is a set of nested similar triangles, where dx/ds = cosθ = cos (TSR). Thus,
MV = MT cos θ = MS cos 2 θ = MR cos3 θ . ]
Corollary 3.
710. If the angle at A is right, then λ = 0. In which case the body must ascent straight up.
But only if λ is made indefinitely small and c infinitely large, in order that 2λ2c has a
finite value, is the body able to move by making use of this curve.
Example 1.
711. Let the curve AM be a circle, the diameter of which is put on the axis AP, and the
radius is equal to a. Thus r = a and ds : dx = a : y . On this account the force P becomes :

Therefore the force pulling downwards on M varies inversely as the cube of the upright

also dx = − dz and dy = − dt [p. 294] and as

Consequently there is found :
and P = 4ab .
From which it is apparent that the force pulling downwards is constant, which is effective
as the body progresses along the parabola. Whereby therefore, if this force is taken as the
force of gravity equal to 1, it gives rise to b = a4 , equal to the distance of the focus from
the vertex. Which are in agreement with what was found above (564 and onwards.)
[This corresponds to our normal presentation of the parabola, y 2 = 4ax , where the focus
lies on the semi-latus rectum AB, and CB is taken as equal to a; if here the vertex to

714. For the given curve AMB (Fig. 65) together with the centre of attraction C, to find
the law of the centripetal force, which must act, in order that the body is free to move
along that curve, and to find the speed of the body at any position M.
SOLUTION.
Since the curve AMB is given together with the point C,
the equation is sought between the distance MC of any
point of the curve M from the centre C and the
perpendicular CT, that is sent from C to the tangent MT.
Whereby with CM = y and CT = p the equation between
p and y can be obtained. Now let the speed of the body at
the point A correspond to the height c and the
perpendicular from C sent to the tangent at A be equal to
h. Truly of these unknown quantities, let the height corresponding to the speed at M be
equal to v and the centripetal force at M is equal to P. With these put in place, we have

THEOREM.
720. The force pulling towards C (Fig. 66), that is put in place in order that the body
moves along the given curve AM, has the ratio to the force pulling towards another
centre of force c, which is put in place in order that the body can move around the same
curve with the same periodic time, as the cube of the line cV from c to the tangent TM
drawn parallel to the line CM, is to the volume formed from the line cM multiplied by the
square of the line CM.
DEMONSTRATION.
Let the speed of the body at a given point A, with the body
rotating around the centre of force C, correspond to the height
c and the perpendicular sent from C to the tangent at A is equal
to h. But when the body is moving around the centre of force
c, let the speed at A correspond to the height γ and the
perpendicular sent from the centre c to the tangent at A is
equal to θ. Moreover since the periodic times around each
centre of force are equal, then h c = θ γ or ch 2 = γθ 2 (715).
From the centre C and from c perpendiculars CT and ct are
again sent to the tangent at M, and the radius of osculation at
M is equal to r. With these in place, the centripetal force at M pulling towards C, that weEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Moreover with the line drawn cV parallel to the line CM, as triangles TCM and tcV are
similar, we have CT : ct = CM : cV . Hence because of this,
Q.E.D. [p. 298]
Corollary 1.
721. The speed of the body at the same point M, while it is being attracted to the centre of
forces C, to the speed, while it is being attracted to the other centre c, vary inversely as
CT to ct or directly as cV to CM. This is a consequence of ch 2 = γθ 2 .
Corollary 2.
722. If the periodic times are not equal, but are to each other as T to t, then
T : t = 1 : 1 or ch 2 : γθ 2 = t 2 : T 2 . Consequently it follows that the ratio of the

Or the forces P and Π are in the ratio composed from the ratio assigned for equal periods
in the theorem, and inversely as the square of the periodic times.
Corollary 3.
723. In this same case, in which the periodic times are unequal, the speed of the body at
M, with the centre of forces placed at C, to the speed at M, with the centre of forces
placed at c, are in the reciprocal ration composed from the ratio of the perpendiculars CT
and ct and in the ratio of the period times T : t.

724. Newton deduced this Proposition in Book I, prop. VII, coroll. 3 of the Princ., and
that was used to find the centripetal force acting at some point, from the known force
acting at some other centre. Here we show the use of this in the following single example.
[p. 299]
Example.
725. Let the given curve be the circle AMc (Fig. 67), and
one centre of forces is put at the centre of the circle C.
Therefore the force P pulling everywhere towards C is
constant and is called g. From this is sought the force
acting towards a centre of forces c situated on the
periphery and making Π, in order that the body is movingEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

to the tangent MV, which from the nature of the circle is likewise parallel to the line CM.

Therefore this force Π varies inversely as the fifth power of the distance Mc of the body
from the centre of forces c, now as was found above (692).
Corollary 4.
726. Let the speed of the body rotating on the periphery of the circle around the centre C
correspond to the height c and the speed of the body at M rotating around the centre of
forces c correspond to the height v. Hence :

728. In these propositions we have put in place the curve that the body describes, which
is given completely with the equation for that curve. But there are also the cases, in which
the curve itself is not given that describes the motion, but rather the motion itself must
first be found by examining certain conditions, so that the law of the centripetal force can
then be found. And here these propositions are concerned, and which have been treated
everywhere, with the motion of bodies in moving orbits, concerning which therefore we
treat in the following proposition. [We note that the fifth power situation with the centre
of force lying on the orbit would not be a physically realizable situation.]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

PROPOSITION 89.
PROBLEM.
729. If the orbit ( A)(M)(B) (Fig. 65) is revolving around some centre of forces C, it is
required to define the centripetal force always pulling towards C, which is put in place,
in order that the body is moving in this moveable orbit.
SOLUTION.
While the orbit comes from the
situation (A)(M)(B) to the situation
AMB, the body meanwhile is put to
have come from (A) to M, thus as the
body in the orbit meanwhile describes
the angle (A)C(M) = ACM, but actually
the angle (A)CM = (A)C(M) + (A)CA
[p. 301] has been described. Initially
with the body present at (A), the true
speed at this point is not that which it
has in the orbit, but corresponds to the
altitude c; and the line C(A) is
perpendicular both to the orbit as well
as to the true curve on which the body
moves, and which is equal to a. Again
the speed of the body at M , as much as
it is moving in the orbit, corresponds to
the height u and the true speed of the
body at M corresponds to the height v.
But the angular speed in the orbit to the true angular speed around C, while the body is
moving at M, is as 1 to w. Therefore in the orbit considered stationary, the element
(M)(m) is described with the speed u . The distance C(M) is put equal to CM = y and
the perpendicular C( T ) = CT = p is sent from C to the tangent to the orbit at (M) or M,
and an equation exists between p and y on account of the given orbit. Now while the body
describes the element Mm in the orbit, the orbit itself progresses around C with the
orbital angular motion through the angle mCμ , and on this account the body is found,
not indeed at m, but instead at μ, by taking Cμ = Cm , and meanwhile the element Mμ is
agreed to have been described by that speed which corresponds to the height v. Hence we
have :
and with the small [circular] arc Mv described with centre C (on account of the given
angular motions about C in the orbit and in fact in the ratio 1 : w ) for which the ratio is :
[Thus, the first proportionality describes the ratio of the displacements of the body in the
orbit reference frame to the absolute reference frame in which the orbit itself rotates; theEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

second proportionality considers the corresponding angular speed by taking the
corresponding arcs of a circle Mn and Mv, the first relative to the orbit reference frame
and the second relative to the absolute reference frame .]
ydy
pdy
Truly, with the tangent put in place : MT = ( y 2 − p 2 ) = q , Mm = q and Mn = q
[In a small displacement along the orbital curve, CM corresponds to y and Cm
corresponds to y + dy; hence mn is equal to dy in the elemental triangle mMn. The
curvature remains the same on Mm, and the centre of curvature lies along the normal to
the curve and the tangent at M, i. e. on a line parallel to CT (but not passing through C
unless the orbit is a circular one); hence, the angle TCM is a measure of the angle
between the direction of MC or y and the direction of the normal to the curve at M, which
stays constant along Mm. Hence the angle Mmn is the complement of this angle, and
hence the angle mMn is equal to the angle TCM. It follows that the triangles Mnm and
MTC are similar; hence the ratio dy/Mm = TM/MC = q/y follows. Meanwhile, the arc Mn
is traced out by the same elemental angle MCn or MCm, for which the constant radius is
y, and the arc length Mn is to dy (the cotangent of the angle mMn or MCT) as p is to q as
above. We have met this result several times already, the last occurrence in (716) above.]

Because Mμ is the element [p. 302] of the true curve that the body describes, the

730. With the radius put equal to 1 then CM =
( w−1 ) pdy
is the element of the angle
qy
(A)CA, that the orbit has completed, while the body travels through the arc (A)(M). For
this reason the angle (A)CA=
∫
( w−1 ) pdy
. And ( w − 1 ) : 1 is as the angular speed of the
qy
orbital to the angular speed of the body, while it is at M in its orbit.
Corollary 2.
731. The speed of the body in the orbit, which is as u , is inversely proportional to wp
itself. Therefore, unless w is constant, this cannot happen, as the body in the stationary
orbit may be moved by this force in this way, attracted to the centre C. [p. 303] [One
would need to add another force as a cause for w to change.]
Corollary 3.
732. Therefore with w constant, i. e. with the ratio of the angular motion of the body to
the angular motion in the orbit always the same, also the speed of the body in the orbit
u is inversely proportional to the perpendicular C(T) to the tangent. And the centripetal
force attracting and being effective towards C , because the body is moving in a
stationary orbit, is equal to
2 a 2 cdp
. For the speed with respect to the orbit, that the body
w 2 p 3 dy
has at (A), corresponds to the height γ , is γ : c = 1 : w (by hypothesis) and c = w2γ ,
from which the centripetal force acting towards C, as the body in the stationary orbit is
moved , is equal to
2a 2γ dp
, as indeed has been found from the above treatment (591).

Corollary 4.
733. Therefore the angle (A)CA in this hypothesis, where w is put constant, which is
completed by the orbit, while the body traverses the arc (A)(M), is equal to
Hence for one complete revolution of the body in the orbit, the orbit itself rotates about C
by the angle ( w − 1).360 degrees.
Corollary 5.
734. Moreover the force, which it effects, as the body moving in this orbit
proportionately to the angular motion in the orbit itself, is [p. 304]
or is equal to
Whereby the difference between the centripetal force for the stationary orbit and the force
for the moving orbit is the latter part which is inversely proportional to the cube of the
distance of the body from the centre of the forces C.
Corollary 6.
735. If we put w = 1, then w − 1 = 0 and then there is no motion of the orbit, in which
case also the centripetal force is equal to
2a 2γ dp
with the other term vanishing. Likewise
p 3 dy
it comes about, if w = −1 or w − 1 = −2 , in which case the orbit in the preceding moves
with twice the speed that the body itself moves in the orbit. [From the factor w – 1 in
(734)] But the true curve, that in this motion is described by the body, does not differ
from the orbit, except that it is in the opposite sense.
Corollary 7.
736. If w > 1, then as a consequence the orbit is moving; and the greater this motion
becomes, the greater also becomes the centripetal force. But if w < 1, with the orbit
pulling in the opposite direction, and the centripetal force is less, as w2 − 1 is negative.
Corollary 8.
737. If w = 0, then this makes c = 0, and the body is moving along a straight line, since in
this case the angular motion of the orbit is equal and opposite to the angular motion of the
body in its orbit.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

page 421
Corollary 9.
738. If w is negative, surely equal to − n , then the body moves on the same curve as if
[p. 305] w = + n , only with this distinction, that the body proceeds in the opposite sense.
And on this account the centripetal force retains the same value, whether w takes positive
or negative values. Likewise the same result holds generally, if w is a variable quantity.
Example.

focal points. The latus rectum of this is put equal to L and the transverse axis (A)(B) =

and
[Note that the use of the eccentricity e had not yet been developed for conic sections, and
conics were specified by their width and the length of the latus rectum or focal chord. In
modern terminology, with the semi-latus rectum l = a( 1 − e 2 ) and b 2 = a 2 ( 1 − e 2 ) , and

740. The curves themselves, which bodies describe acted on by centripetal forces of this
kind, otherwise are most difficult to be recognised and their form from this consideration
does not mean that in any way they can be determined. [p. 306] Therefore investigations
of centripetal forces of this kind have the maximum use for curves generated by some
given force, from which in turn, from the given centripetal forces, properties of the
curves themselves can become known. For so complex expressions of the forces acting
there occur in the motions of heavenly bodies, so that none of the orbits of these can be
determined, except perhaps these forces can be understood in some such case, for which
the orbits can be determined after the centripetal force has been found.
Scholium 2.
741. If a body is taken to be moving in a moving orbit of this kind, the motion of this
body and the distance at some time from the centre C can be determined. And just as
often as the body in the orbit arrives at the points(A) and (B), so the distance from C is a
minimum or a maximum. Whereby when the rotary motion of the line (A)(B), which is
called the line of the apses, is given, it is possible to define when the distance from the
centre C is a maximum or a minimum. Newton has explored this problem in the
Principia, Book I, in the whole of Section IX, and that theory applies the motion of the
apses in the determination of the moon's orbit. But this examination is applied with less
accuracy to the moon, since the lunar force is not acting at any fixed point, as we have
put here, but is always exerted from some variable point. Therefore we will give the
work, in order that, after we have explained relevant matters here, we will offer other
more suitable propositions, which can be transferred to the motion of the moon. [p. 307]

PROBLEM.
747. If the figure that the body describes on being acted on by some central force does
differ much from a circle, to determine the motion of the apses.
SOLUTION.
The motion of this is to be compared with the motion of the body in a moving ellipse
with a small eccentricity, of which one or other focus is placed at the centre of the forces.
Therefore in this stationary orbit the body is moving acted on by a centripetal force
inversely proportional to the square of the distance. Truly the body is moving in the same
orbit if the centripetal force is equal to
ffy + C
(746). With the preceding denominators
y3
kept in place, and putting y = a + z ; where z is extremely small with respect to a, since
the curve described by the body is put as nearly circular. Whereby the former centripetal
aff + C + ffz
, and as 2a is approximately equal to the latus rectum L. Now
y3
the centripetal force acting is put equal to P3 , in which P is some function of y. The
y
force is equal to
value a + z is put in place of y in P, and P can be changed into E + Fz by rejecting terms
in which z has a dimension greater than one, on account of z being so small. Therefore
this formula has to be compared with aff + C + ffz :
F = ff or f = F and aF + C = E or C = E − aF . With these substituted, the body acted
on by this centripetal force P3 comes from the smaller to the larger apse, with the angle
y

Corollary 2.
749. Since E is such a function of a, just as P is of y, Fz is the increment of E from the
increase of a by the element z. Whereby on putting z = da then Fda = dE , and likewise
the angle, by which the body arrives at the larger apse from the smaller one, is equal to
Eda degrees.

Corollary 3.
Eda in place of a and P
750. Since E is such a function of a, as P is of y, y can be put in adE
in place of E. On account of which by the presence of the centripetal force P3 , the body
y

moves from the small apse to the large apse in an absolute angle of 180 ydp degrees.
And if y remains in this expression, a can be written in place of y, clearly with a small
discrepancy. [p. 312]

force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, and the apse line remains at

from the nearer apse to the further apse.

back again, which is 360μ degrees, we have μ 2 = ydP and likewise P μμ = αy or

Therefore the centripetal force 3 which makes the apsidal line have such a motion, is

Corollary 6.
Pdy
753. If it happens, that ydP or dP is made negative, then the motion of the apses is
imaginary. From which it is understood that the body is never able to proceed from one
apse to the other, but continually either recedes further from the centre or approaches the
centre, or evidently it is in a closed orbit that does not change.
Corollary 7.
754. If the centripetal force is proportional to the power of the distance y n , then
P = y n +3 . Whereby ydP = n 1+3 , [p. 313] and the body goes from the closer to the further
Pdy
apse while going through the absolute angle about C of 180
( n+3 )
degrees; and to go from
the greater or smaller apse to return to the same by going through an angle of
360 degrees.
( n+3 )
Corollary 8.
755. If
( n + 3 ) is a rational number and m the smallest whole number, from which
m
makes some whole number, then after completing m
revolutions about the
( n+3 )
( n+3 )
centre C the body has fallen on the same point and the curve described by the body has
completed as many whole turns before it is restored and closed. But if n + 3 is not a
perfect square, then the curve can never be restored to its starting point, but the body
indefinitely travels around the centre C, and neither does it at any time revert to the same
path.
Example 1.
756. If the centre of forces attracts in the inverse cube of the distances, then n + 3 = 0.
Hence in this hypothesis, the body cannot travel from one apse to the other except by
completing an infinite number of revolutions. And if the centripetal force decreases in a
greater ratio than the third power of the distances, the curve clearly does not have two
apses, but will either go to infinity or terminate as a logarithmic spiral towards the centre.
[p. 314]
Example 2.
757. If the centripetal force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, then
n + 3 = 1. Whereby while the body by the absolute angular motion completes an angle of
180 degrees it travels from one apse to the other, and the curve after any revolutionEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

returns to its initial condition. For the body it travelling in an ellipse, in either focus of
which is placed the centre of forces, and the transverse axis of this ellipse is the line of
the apses.
Example 3.
758. If the centripetal force varies inversely as the distance, then n + 3 = 2. Therefore the
body arrives at one apse from the other after the orbit has turned through an angle of 180
2
or 127 degrees and 17'. Truly the orbit never returns on itself on account of the
irrational 2 .
Example 4.
759. If the centripetal force is constant at all distances, then n = 0. In this case the body
goes from one apse to the other while the angular motion carries the orbit through an
angle of 180 degrees, i. e. 103 degrees and 55' approximately.

Example 5.
760. If the centripetal force varies directly as the distance of the body from the centre, in
which case the body is agreed to be moving in an ellipse, in the centre of which the centre
of force has been placed. (631). Therefore with the apses standing apart by an angle of
90 degrees. The same can truly be deduced from this rule. for on account of n = 1 the
angle is 180 = 90 . [p. 315]

Scholium 1.
761. Therefore as often as the body is projected around the centre of force with such a
velocity, so that it almost revolves in a circle, with the help of this proposition the true
curve that the body describes can be determined, which is not possible by considering the
centripetal force alone. For which it is evident on greater contemplation that there are
more uses of this kind for these orbits, by determining other more difficult orbits from
these that can easily be defined. Newton has set out the same proposition in Sect. IX ,
Prop. 45.
Scholium 2.
762. Now we have shown above that a body acting under a hypothetical centripetal force
varying inversely as the cube of the distance falling to the centre, arrives in a finite time
and does not to escape from that point, but as it were, to be annihilated suddenly (675
and 676). The same also prevails if the body falls to the centre along a straight line. And
in a similar manner, if the centripetal force decreases in a ratio greater than the inverse
cube of the distance, the body at once arrives at the centre, where it vanishes and neither
progresses further than the centre nor returns. For whatever you please, it would be
absurd for the curve that the body describes, projected with a certain velocity, to have
two apses (756). Moreover as often as the centripetal force decreases in a ratio less than
the cube, as in the simple ratio of the distance or greater than that, the body recedes, after
it arrives at the centre, [p. 316] along the same line by which it approached; for this isEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

evident for the inverse square of the distance (655) and for the simple ratio, from which it
is apparent (271) that the body cannot progress beyond the centre. But if n + 1 > 0, the
body falling towards the centre along a straight line has a finite speed, by which beyond
the centre it can progress along the same straight line, as long as it was losing speed
(273). Therefore in this way we have satisfied the above desire (272), in which it was
necessary to define the linear motion of the falling body, when it arrived at the centre.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

PROPOSITIO 89. PROBLEMA.

729. Si orbita ( A)(M)(B) (Fig. 65) utcunque revolvatur circa centrum virium C, oportet
definiri vim centripetam perpetuo ad C tendentem, quae faciat, ut corpus in hac orbita
mobili moveatur.
SOLUTIO.
Dum orbita ex situ (A)(M)(B) in
situm AMB pervenit, ponatur corpus
interea ex (A) in M pervenisse, ita ut
corpus interea in orbita angulum
(A)C(M) = ACM, revera autem
angulum (A)CM = (A)C(M) + (A)CA
[p. 301] descripserit. Existente initio
corpore in (A) sit eius celeritas vera,
non ea, quam in orbita habet, debita
altitudini c, et recta C(A), quae tam in
orbitam quam in veram curvam, in qua
corpus movetur, sit perpendicularis, =
a. Porro sit celeritas corporis in M ,
quatenus in orbita movetur, debita
altitudini u et vera corporis celeritas in
M debita altitudine v. At celeritas
angularis in orbita sit ad veram
celeritatem angularem circa C, dum
corpus in M versatur, ut 1 ad w. In
orbita igitur tanquam immobili spectata elementum (M)(m) celeritate u describetur.
Ponatur distantia C(M) = CM – y et perpendiculum in tangentem orbitae in (M) vel M ex
C demissum C( T ) = CT = p , habebiturque ob orbitam datam aequatio inter p et y. Iam
dum corpus in orbita elementum Mm describit, progrediatur ipsa orbita motu angulari
circa C per angulum = mCμ , et hanc ob rem corpus reipsa non in m, sed in μ reperietur,
sumto Cμ = Cm , atque idcirco interea elementum Mμ descripsisse censendum est, id
quod fecit celeritate debita altitudini v. Erit itaque
atque centro C descripto arculo Mv (ob datam motuum angularium circa C in orbita et
revera rationem 1 : w ) erit

731. Cereritas corporis in orbita, quae est ut u , reciproce proportionalis est ipsi wp.
Ergo, nisi w sit constans, fieri non potest, ut corpus hoc modo in orbita quiescente
moveatur attractum ad centrum C. [p. 303]
Corollarium 3.
732. Posito igitur w constante, i. e. ratione motus angularis corporis ad motum angularem
orbitae perpetuo eadem, erit etiam celeritas corporis in orbita u reciproce
proportionalis perpendiculo C(T) in tangentem. Atque vis centripeta ad C tendens atque
efficiens, ut corpus hac ratione in orbita quiescente moveatur, erit =

w 2 p 3 dy
celeritas respectu orbitae, quam corpus in (A) habet, debita altitudini γ , erit
γ : c = 1 : w (p. hyp.) atque c = w2γ , ex quo vis centripeta ad C tendens faciensque,

orbita in antecedentia movetur duplo velocius, quam ipsum corpus in orbita ingreditur. At
vera curva, quae hoc motu a corpore describitur, non differt ab orbita, nisi quod sit
inversa.

Corollarium 7.

736. Si w > 1, orbita in consequentia movetur; qui motus quo sit maior, eo maior etiam
erit vis centripeta. At si w < 1, orbita in antecedentia tendit, et vis centripeta fit minor, ob
w2 − 1 negativum.

Corollarium 8.

737. Si w = 0, fit etiam c = 0, corpusque in recta linea movebitur, quia motus angularis
orbitae hoc casu aequalis fit et contrarius motui angulari corporis in orbita.

Corollarium 9.

738. Si w est numerus negativus, nempe = − n , corpus in eadem movebitur curva, [p.
305] ac si esset w = + n , hoc tantum discrimine, quod corpus in contrarius plagas
progrediatur. Et hanc ob rem vis centripeta eundem retinet valorem, sive w affirmative
sive negative accipiatur. Idem etiam universaliter, si w est quantitas variabilis, obtinet.

740. Curvae ipsae, quas corpora a huiusmodi viribus centripetis sollicitata describunt,
difficillime alias cognoscerentur earumque forma hac consideratione non adhibita
nequaquam posset determinari. [p. 306]Maximam igitur habent utilitatem huiusmodi
virium centripetarum investigationes pro curvis ex datis utcunque generatis, quo
reciproce ex viribus centripetis datis ipsae curvae earumque proprietates innotescant.
Occurrunt enim in motibus corporum coelestium tam complexae virium ea sollicitantium
expressiones, ut omnino eorum orbitae determinari nequaeant, nisi forte illae vires
comprehendantur in tali quodam casu, de quo a posteriori vis centripeta est inventa.
