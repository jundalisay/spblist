PROPOSITION 24. THEOREM.

189. When the directions of the motion and of the force are along the same straight line,
the motion will be rectilinear.

DEMONSTRATION.

Every body by its inertial force tries to continue its motion in the direction that it
always performs, unless it is impeded (65). Truly there are two effects of a force on the
motion of a body that we can show : the one by which the direction is unchanged, and the
other by which the speed is unchanged. But the direction remains unchanged if the
direction of the force lies in the direction that the point moves (128). Therefore in this
case the point goes on traveling in a straight line. Q. E. D.

Corollary 1.

190. We will only consider the case in this chapter in which the motion of the point and
the direction of the force acting are placed on the same straight line.
Corollary 2.

191. Moreover we see that this consistency can come about in two ways, as clearly either
both [the inertial force and the applied force] are acting in the same direction, [p. 77] or
in opposite directions. In the one case the speed of the point is increased, and in the other
it is decreased 128).

Scholium.

192. There are two things that have to be consider in this rectilinear motion, the first of
which is the force upon which some point mass is acted, and the other is indeed the speed
that the point has at any place. To these we may add also the time in which some interval
of distance is traversed. Indeed these three variables are thus comparable, since with one
given the remaining two can always be determined. In the first place therefore we will consider some force as given : then truly on that account we will find either the
corresponding speed or time from the given force.

PROPOSITION 25.
PROBLEM.

193. The point A is resting on the line (Fig. 22) AP, and is to be pulled forwards by a
uniform force, or which acts with the same strength everywhere, and the speed of the
point is to be determined at any position P.


SOLUTION.

The mass or the force of inertia of the point is set out by the letter A, and
the [external] force by the letter g, which is constant since it is the same
amount everywhere. Let the distance AP = x, and the required speed at P
is put equal to c. An element of distance Pp is taken, which is equal to dx;
and the increment of the speed dc is acquired by the point on completing
the element Pp, acted on by the force g [p. 78]. With these put in place, it
follows that A
ngdx
cdc = (157), since the force constantly pulls downwards,
and on this account we put the motion to be accelerating.

<!-- [This integrated equation corresponds, from our point of view, to the usual
kinematic equation asuv 222 += where the initial speed u is zero, and the equation can
be differentiated to give vdv = ads; which can of course be related to work done and the
corresponding change in kinetic energy; in addition, the acceleration is given by
Newton's second law of motion, F/m . Euler has however derived this equation for a
general situation from first principles in Prop. 20, of which (157) is Cor. 3, in Ch. 2, in
pre conservation of energy days, where cdc has been set up so that an integration can be
performed, and this quantity is proportional to g/A (the force per unit mass), and the
element of distance in the direction of the force dx, for which some constant n is inserted
to relate the two sides of the equation, which otherwise are proportional quantities,
according to Galileo's ideas. Thus, all the differential equations presented, that can be
integrated, rely on proportions.] -->

From this equation, if it is integrated, there arises .Const
2 += A
ngx
cc , which constant
must be determined from the condition that the speed of the point vanishes at A.
Therefore from this it follows that c = 0, and x = 0, gives the constant as zero. On account
of which we have A
ngx
A
ngx ccc 22 or == . Q. E. I.
Corollary I.
194. Therefore the point A always falls along the straight line AP, and the speed at any
point is as the square root of the distance now traversed.

Corollary 2.
195. From these also, the descents of many points acted on by uniform or constant forces
can be compared; for the speeds are in the ratio directly of the square root of the forces
and the distances traversed, and inversely as the square root of the masses.
Scholium 1.
196. This case agrees above all with the fall of bodies on the earth : for the force of
gravity, which in turn takes the place of the force, is uniform for not too great distances
from the surface of the earth. In so much as the weight of any body from the highest
mountain to the deepest valley is found to be the same ; moreover from the weight the
force of gravity is found. Therefore in the free fall of weights the speeds are as the square
roots of the distances traversed. This is the proposal of Galileo himself, that he
discovered first from experiment and then by reasoning [p. 79]. Moreover the descent
should be made in a space from which the air has been evacuated, since the air resists the
motion and this effect is avoided.
Scholium 2.
197. In an empty space, which can be effected with the help of pneumatic pumps, it has
been shown by many experiments that any bodies fall equally. From which it follows, if
there should be no air, all bodies that fall from equal heights gain equal speeds. On
account of this, if g designates the force of gravity, by which any body A is moved, then
A
g is always the same constant. Hence the force of gravity is proportional to the quantity
of matter in the body on which it acts. But that force is none other than the weight of the
body ; whereby the weight in the Princip. Phil. confirms this too, and that besides is in
agreement with pendulum experiments.
Corollary 3.
198. Therefore any body on the surface of the earth fallen from a given height will
acquire a step of the speed. Therefore with the height known, from which the body
descended, [the speed] acquired from the descent will be known likewise.
Scholium 3.
199. Therefore in order that we can measure these speeds, these heights are to put in
place from which a weight falling to the surface of the earth acquires an equal speed [p.
80]. Indeed this height cannot be substituted in place of the speed itself, since the speeds
are in the square root ratio to the height. Yet truly it will be possible for the height to
denote the square of the speed.
DEFINITION 15.
200. Hereafter we will call the height corresponding to the speed that height, from which
a weight falling to the surface of the earth, acquires that same speed.
EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.
Chapter Three (part a).
Translated and annotated by Ian Bruce. page 95
Corollary 1.
201. This height must therefore be as the square of the speed, to which it refers. With the
speed c arising and with the due height v, v shall be as c2. [There is thus to be a
proportionality between c2 and v. People had a lot of trouble with non-standardised units
in these days, and preferred to use proportionalities instead, whenever they could. Here of
course an independent variable v is introduced for the uniform height that can be
integrated, without worrying about the more troublesome speed c. ]
Scholium 1.
202. This far we have expressed the speed on a straight line, which can be traversed by
the speed in a given time. But in the following it will be more convenient to introduce the
corresponding height in place of this [Euler calls this the height owing or due, as one
would do in a financial transaction; there is hence the understanding that something is
conserved or changed from one form into another, in this analysis of a falling body; Euler
uses the distance fallen as a means of representing the speed.] On account of this we put v
= cc and vc = . We will therefore have in the preceding problem this equation :
A
ngx
v 2
= .
Corollary 2.
203. Therefore in what follows, in place of the speed c it will be permitted to put v or
the square root of height that corresponds to the speed. [p. 81; Note the use of the
symbols : v here refers to verticalis for vertical (height), c refers to celeritas for speed, s
refers to spatium or interval of distance; some of these symbols have endured to the
present time, as for example c for the speed of light.]
Corollary 3.
204. If the force g denotes that of gravity itself, then x will be the height corresponding to
the speed c, and thus v = x. For indeed A
ngx
v 2
= , from which it therefore follows that
2g
An = . From this we have gained a convenience, as we have determined the value of
the letter n, which must maintain the same value in all cases (155).
Scholium 2.
205. Since g signifies the force of gravity [i. e. the weight of the body; do not confuse g
with our symbol for the acceleration of gravity, which it does not represent], then A
g is a
constant quantity (197). Therefore we can put this as 1, as that is allowed, since the force
to the [mass] does not [yet] have a defined ratio. And hence it easily shows the ratio of
A
g in all cases, or the value of the applied force to the [mass of the] body. Certainly the

ratio A
g to 1 or g : A as the force g, acting on the body A, is to the weight [this should be
mass], that the same body may have in our part of the world. Therefore the letter A will
no longer denote the quantity of matter, but the weight A of the body itself, [since A.1 is
the weight] if it should be placed on the surface of the earth. In this way we will compare
all forces with weights, since that will add a great deal of light to the measurement of
forces.
Corollary 4.
206. Since g
An 2
= , g denotes the force of gravity [i. e. the weight of the body and not the
acceleration] and if 1=g
A , then 2
1=n . That value will always be retained, if the speeds
are to be expressed in terms of the appropriate square roots of the heights. And thus in
our situation, this becomes A
gx
A
gdx vdv == and . [p. 82. Thus, Euler chooses as his
working dimensions not distance and time but acceleration and time. The time is
measured in seconds, and with the acceleration of gravity A/g = 1, then 2
1=n .]
Corollary 5.
207. On this account in the general law A
npds
cdc = (157), if the height v of the
corresponding speed is c, then 2
dvcdc = , and thus on account of 2
1=n this law is
obtained A

dv = , where p is to A as the force p is to the weight of the body A.
[For Euler has defined c 2 = v and hence dv = 2cdc = A

Corollary 6.
208. In a like manner, indeed the equations set out in (161) and (163) :
,and 2dsAcnprdxnpdyAcdc == by substituting v in place of c 2 and
2
1 in place of n, are transformed into ,2and AvdsprdxpdyAdv == where p to A has the

Corollary 7.
209. And in (165) it is found that 2
p
Avr = or pr = 2Av. Likewise in (165) there is
obtained ,pdsAdv = and in the case of (167) there is obtained .pdsAdv −= And in this
manner we have reduced the previous variable quantities n and c to fixed values.

PROPOSITION 26.
THEOREM.
210. The heights, by which equal small bodies fall to acquire equal speeds, vary
inversely as the forces, under the hypothesis of different uniform [gravitational] forces.
DEMONSTRATION.
Let the mass or weight of some small body on the surface of the earth be A, the
force [on some other celestial body] some constant value g and the corresponding height
[p. 83] for this speed to be acquired be v. Truly the height shall be x, by which the small
body A falling under the action of the force g shall acquire a speed [c2 = ] 2
A
ngx
v =
(202). But 2
1=n (206), hence A
gx
v = or Av = gx. [On the Earth, g/A = 1 and v = x.]
Whereby, since the speeds have been produced by different forces and the bodies have
been made equal, then the quantity Av is constant, and thus also gx. On account of this, x
will vary inversely as g, i. e. the height, by which the body A acquires the speed v by the
action of the force g, varies inversely as the force g. Q. E. D.
[No doubt by now the reader has thrown up his or her hands in horror and said : what
about the conservation of mechanical energy ? The factor n = ½ has arisen from the
requirement that the acceleration of gravity is one. The problem for us lies in the lack of
understanding that there was at the time about kinetic and potential energy and the
conservation of the sum of these for a falling body. Euler has been very clever and set up
his differential equations so that they can be scaled, and when it comes down to doing a
numerical example, as with the flight of the cannonball in Ch. 4, he gets the correct
answers. Thus, the answers right themselves when known experimental values are put in
place for the time of fall of a body. It has been convenient to put the acceleration of
gravity arbitrarily as 1, from which by (209) n = ½ (for Euler does his best to get rid of
constants that always appear, a tradition that has been followed by theoreticians ever
since!); but if the time is measured in seconds and the distance in scruples or thousandth
parts of Rhenish feet, then the acceleration of gravity is not 1, but something around 32
ft/s2 or 32000 scruples/s2 . If fact, from the equation gHV 22 = , for the speed V of a
body dropped from rest from a height H is given by HHHgV 250625002 =×≈= ,
the scaling factor used by Euler later. Hence when experimental results are imposed, the
correct value for the acceleration of gravity results, and all is well.]
Corollary 1.
211. Newton has shown that the impressed forces on the same body put in place on the
surface, and acted upon towards the centre of, the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, or the Earth, are
as 10000, 835, 525, and 400. Therefore the heights from which the body acquires equal
speeds in falling on the surface of the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Earth, are between
themselves as .and,, 410

Corollary 2.
212. Moreover Newton understood likewise that all bodies fall at equal rates on these
surfaces, just as on the surface of the earth. Therefore there is no need to add the
condition that the bodies are equal, for from the heights which are in the ratio to each
other ,and,, 410

1 on the surfaces of the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Earth,
any bodies dropped will acquire the same increase in their speed. [p. 84]
Scholium 1.
213. It is understood from these that there is a two-fold effect on the body by any force :
on the one hand, by which a certain force or effort is impressed on the body, and on the
other, by how the body may be moved by that force. The one that is to be considered
mainly in statics is the weight and how it should be measured, that the body has in an
equal attempt to fall downwards, and it may be called the absolute strength of the force.
In turn, truly the effect should be measured by the acceleration or the change in the speed,
that is impressed on the body in a given time : this is proportional to that force divided by
the mass of the body (154). This effect is called by Newton the accelerating force, and
therefore the strength of the accelerating force is proportional to absolute force applied to
the mass of the body, or the weight applied. On account of which, since A
pds
dv = (207)
and A
p denotes the strength of the acceleration, then dv is equal to the product of the
acceleration and the element of distance travelled. Thus the absolute force of gravity is
proportional to the mass of the bodies on which it acts ; for the effect of these downwards
is the cause or the weight that we have shown to be in proportion to the mass. Moreover
the accelerating force of gravity is equal on all bodies, since they all fall equally and they
gain equal speeds in equal intervals of time.
Corollary 3.
214. Hence the sizes of the accelerations are to each other as the absolute forces, if the
bodies are of equal mass. Whereby since the strength of the acceleration due to gravity is
taken as 1, as we have put in place before (205), [p. 85] then the strength of the
accelerating due to gravity on the surface of the sun is equal to 24.290; the strength of the
acceleration on the surface of Jupiter is 2.036; the strength of the acceleration on the
surface of Saturn is 1.280. And the strength of gravity has been taken on the moon by
Newton as 3
1 .
Corollary 4.
215. Whereby if from Proposition 25 the fall of the body to the surface of the Earth is to
be accounted for, then 1=A
g , as we have done in (205). But truly the fall of bodies on the
surface of the sun requires 290.24=A
g ; or on the surface of Jupiter, 036.2=A
g ; on the
surface of Saturn 280.1=A
g ; and for the fall of bodies on the surface of the moon, it will
be 3
1=A
g .

216. Here we assume with Newton that all celestial bodies are similar to our Earth and
bodies placed on the surface of these have a force pulling then to their centre, which is
always similar to the force of terrestrial on bodies. Therefore, from Newton's exposition,
it is apparent that a body, the weight of which here is 1 pound [lb.], will weigh on the
surface of the Sun 24.290 lb ;on the surface of Jupiter, it will be 036.2 lb; on the surface
of Saturn 280.1 lb ; and on the surface of the moon one third of a pound. [p. 86]
Scholium 3.
217. Moreover in order that the nature of the gravitational forces can be more easily
compared for celestial bodies, the individual equal elements of the bodies are understood
to be equally affected by gravity. From which it follows, since now it agrees with
experiment, that the forces of gravity which act on any bodies, are themselves
proportional to the masses or quantities of matter. Truly it has been shown previously,
that if the forces are in proportion to the masses of the bodies, then their effect on moving
bodies is the equal (136). On which account it is shown from these that all bodies on the
surface of the earth should descent equally, and likewise for all celestial bodies.

PROBLEM.
218. For the point A (Fig. 22) is to be moved forwards through the
distance AP by a uniform force, and it is required to find the time in
which the distance AP is completed.
SOLUTION.
As before, let the force acting be g, the distance AP = x and the
height corresponding to the speed at P should be v; on this account

dt = it is necessary to perform a single
experiment to determine the value of the letter [p. 87] m, so that the time in the given

Axmt = to which there is no need to
add on a constant quantity, since for the position x = 0 the time t vanishes, as it should.
Therefore on determining m by experiment we have the time to fall given by g

necessary that x likewise is shown to be measured in agreement with this constant [i. e. in
some standard unit of length]: therefore we will always determine the interval x in

scruples, i. e. thousandth parts of Rhenish feet ; for indeed the fraction g
A is expressed in
absolute numbers, in order that it will not be necessary to have a certain measurement for
that. Therefore with the letter m defined, that we will make soon, the complete solution
to the problem will be had. Q. E. I.
Corollary 1.
219. If g designates the force of gravity, then 1=g
A (205) ; on account of this the time in
which the body will fall to the earth from the height of x scruples of Rhenish feet, will
be xm2 seconds.
Corollary 2.
220. Moreover from experiments it has been ascertained that in a time of one second a
body falls through a height of 15625 scruples of Rhenish feet [4.904 metres, which is in
good agreement with the modern accepted value, although we do not know where the
measurements were made for the full significant figures]. When on account of this, if the
height is put as x = 15625, a time of one second will be produced : t = 1. But since
xmt 2= , then 1562521 m= , i. e. = 250m. Hence the letter m is found to be 250
1=m .
[p. 88; when we compare this equation with the present value of the acceleration of
gravity of around 9.8 m/s2 in which case 2
2
1 gtx = , then in Euler's units of scruples, the
acceleration of gravity g is given by 15625 × 2 = 31,250 scruples/s2 , corresponding to
9.81 m/s2 ; we have discussed this in a slightly different way previously at the end of
(210).]
Corollary 3.
221. Since indeed the letter m retains the same value in all cases, in the case of the
problem, the time will be g
Axt 125
1= sec. Therefore with the distance x expressed in
scruples of Rhenish feet, the time as the number of seconds is given by g

space to be traversed [by falling from rest].
Corollary 4.
222. And in all straight forward cases this value of m found can be applied. Indeed let the
element of distance to be described be ds, with the height v corresponding to the speed in
which this is traversed, the element of time is .and ∫== v

if v and s are expressed in scruples of Rhenish feet and we put 250

223. Therefore from this, since we specify the speeds by the square roots of the
corresponding heights, which we take again for convenience in the following, as we
always find the measure of the absolute time. For truly the experiment we have used from
which the height is found that a weight falls in a time of one second, as Huygens found
by experiments with pendulums to be 15 Paris feet, 1 digit, 18
12 lines, i. e. in decimal
fractions 15.0796 Parisian feet. Moreover the ratio of Rhenish feet to Parisian feet we
use is 1000 to 1035, from which the height to fall in one second comes to be 15.625
Rhenish feet or 15,625 [p. 89] scruples of the same feet; and this is the measure we prefer
to have rather than the Parisian one, since this number is a square and in this way we
avoid frequent root extractions. Besides, the number 250 that is found is easily
remembered, by which ∫ v
ds (with s and v expressed in scruples of Rhenish feet) must be
divided in order to find the time in seconds.
Corollary 5.
224. Since A
g denotes the strength of the acceleration of the force (213), the times will be,
in which any distances are traversed under uniform forces, in the square root ratio
composed from the distances and inversely as the strengths of the accelerations.
[i. e. 2
ats ∝ ]
Corollary 6.
225. With the speed c put in place, that the point A acquires with a force g acting over
the height x; c varies as A
gx (193). Hence ct will be as x, since t is as g
Ax . Consequently
the distances travelled through are in the ratio composed from the times in which they are
described, and the speed that they gain in the descent, for whatever the forces acting in a
uniform manner.
Corollary 7.
226. And the distances that are traversed in equal intervals of time are as the strengths of
the accelerations of the forces acting. [p. 90]
Corollary 8.
227. Therefore the distances through which bodies fall in equal intervals of time on the
surfaces of the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, the Moon, and the Earth, are amongst themselves as
24390, 2036, 1280, 333, 1000. (214).

Corollary 9.
228. For the hypothesis of the same acceleration under the same force, the times in which
any distances are traversed , are as the speeds acquired, and so for the times as with the
speeds, are in the ratio of the square roots of the distances described.
Scholium 2.
229. Here we have always put the descending bodies to start the descent from rest or their
initial speed to be zero. In the following indeed we will investigate these motions, which
arise when the bodies are themselves in motion at the start and now they have some
speed. Moreover with these both the times and the distances ought to be understood,
which in the beginning have their own point where the speed vanishes, and all the
equations found are thus comparable, as with the vanishing of c or v likewise x and t
vanish.
PROPOSITION 28.
THEOREM.
230. For a body falling through the distance AP (Fig. 22), as we have put in place as
hitherto, the [final] speed at P is of such a size, that if it progressed uniformly at this
speed for the same time in which the body had fallen through AP, then it would be able to
complete a distance twice as great as AP.
[p. 91]
DEMONSTRATION.
With everything kept, that we put in place in the preceding proposition,
with the body A, the force g, with the distance described x, with the speed
acquired at P v and with the time of the descent t, then g

distance 2x will be traversed with a uniform speed of v , since v
x2 is
divided by 250, and then we find the number to be expressed in seconds (220).
Consequently the distance 2x is travelled in the same time with the speed v , in which
the distance x is fallen under a uniform acceleration. Q. E. D.
[Thus the final speed is twice the average speed for the motion of a body released from
rest under gravity.]
Corollary 1.
231. Therefore a body acted on by a uniform force falling in a time t through a distance x
will acquire as great a speed, as that by which a body can progress uniformly through the
same distance in half the time t.
EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Corollary 2.
232. Since on the surface of the earth bodies are falling in a time of one second a distance
of 15625 scruples of Rhenish feet, their final speed acquired in the fall will be as great as
that with a uniform motion over a distance of 31250 in one second, or 15625 scruples
traversed in a time of half a second. [p. 92]
Corollary 3.
233. When the speeds are expressed, as we have established, from the square roots of the
heights through which they have fallen, the speed will be as 15625 or as great as 125, in
which time a body in one second can complete a distance of 31250 scruples.
[For which the constant of proportionality can now be evaluated : thus a distance of
15625 corresponds to a speed of 125 in the square root proportionality, for which the
same distance of 15625 scruples corresponds to an actual speed of 31250 scruples/sec. =
250 × 125; or the true speed = 250 × v for the height v fallen. Thus, the constant of
proportionality is 250.]
Corollary 4.
234. It is therefore easy to assign the distance that will be traversed in a time of one
second with the speed expressed by v . Indeed it happens that the distances described in
the same time are in the same ratio as the speeds, thus 125 is to v thus as 31250
scruples is to 250 v . For which by a factor 250 v expresses the distance in scruples
traveled in one second, if indeed for the height v it may be shown by such a
proportionality that the distance can be completed with a speed v in a second, and
which is clearly is equal to the motion.
Example 1.
235. The fall of a body from a height of 1000 ped., will be v = 1000000 in scruples,
whereby for this descent it will acquire as much speed as in one second it travels a
distance 250000 scruples, i. e. it will be able to complete 250 feet in one second.
Corollary 5.
236. And reciprocally, if the speed is expressed by the distance that is traversed in one
second, as we did in the beginning, then this can hence be reduced to our method of
taking square roots for the corresponding heights. Indeed if that distance is a scrup., and
the corresponding height for this speed is v scrup., then it follows that 250 v = a and

237. Let the body have such a speed that in a second it is able to traverse a distance of
1000 feet or 1000000 scrup., then the height that corresponds to this speed will be

238. Therefore the way in which each speed is to be expressed in turn is clear, and how it
may be required that the one can be reduced to the other. For initially we were expressing
the speeds by the distances travelled in a second, or in some other interval of time.
Afterwards, truly it was seen that the speeds were shown to be in agreement with the
corresponding heights. Now truly we show how each way can be adapted to measure the
speed.
PROPOSITION 29.
PROBLEM.
239. The body now initially at B has a given speed along the line BP, and with a uniform
force present acting along the line BP (Fig. 23); the speed of this body is required at any
point P of the line BP.
SOLUTION.
As before let the force of gravity be g and the body A. Indeed the
speed that it has in the beginning at B is due to the height c. We call BP = x,
and the speed at P, that we are looking for, shall correspond to the height v.
As before (207) on account of the constant force g acting on the element Pp
= dx , it follows that A

By integrating [p. 94] we therefore have .Constv A

distance traversed.

241. The solution of the problem comes to mind in another way; for we put the motion
along BP with the initial speed c in B to be considered as part of the motion from rest
along the line AP, as we have put the term, in which the body as it came from A to B has
the proposed speed c . Therefore if this distance AB = k, then A

the previous as a scholium. For on putting the line AB = k, from which the body falling
from A to B gains the speed corresponding to the height c, the time will be, in which this

descent bodies according to the hypothesis of uniform forces that had to be set out.
Therefore I can go on to rectilinear ascent, in which the direction of the speed is in the
opposite direction to the force, that also is now uniform or that I make constant.
PROPOSITION 31.
PROBLEM.
245. The body has a given speed in the upwards direction and with a
uniform force pulling in downwards ; the speed of the body is required
at any point in the interval BA that it has travelled through while rising.
SOLUTION.
It is evident that in this case that the progression of the motion along
the straight line to be one of retardation (191), since the direction of its
motion is acting against the direction of the force. And thus the speed of
the body at B is due to the altitude c, and the body is put in place
arriving at P. The altitude to which the speed at this place is owed, is
called v, and the distance BP now traversed is called x. Take Pp = dx, and
the altitude to which the speed is owed [i. e. corresponding] at p will be v
+ dv. Moreover since the force, that I put equal to g, is contrary in
direction to the motion, the total speed is diminished. On account of this , it is necessary
to put dv equal to A
gdx− , with A denoting the mass of the body. And thus A
gdx
dv =− ,
and on integration, it becomes A

x = 0, in which case v is changed into c; and hence it becomes C = c. From which the

Let BA be equal to that height A

given height, progresses upwards again to reach the same height that it had at the start of
its motion when it was sent off.
Corollary 2.
247. Besides the body ascending through the distance BA has the same speeds at the
individual points, that it has at the same points if it is descending from A. For with AP =
y the speed at P descending, coming from A, is equal to A

Corollary 3.
248. Therefore the motion of the ascending body agrees with the motion of the
descending body, and the speeds of each at the same points are equal, i. e. which are
placed at the same distance from the upper point at which the speed is zero.
Corollary 4.
249. From these it is likewise evident that the time of ascent through the distance BA is
equal to the time of descent through the same distance. Whereby by calling BA = a, the
time of descent is equal to g

251. Evidently in the first place the equation of the ascent has been shown from the
action of the force. Since indeed in the ascent the force takes away as much from the
speed, as it adds on during the descent, it is evident that there is a complete equality
between each motion, and one can be turned into the other without any distinction, unless
the succession of the time, by knowing which the one case is only turned into the other.
EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.
Chapter Three (part a).

Indeed the reasoning is also the same of all the motion produced by the absolute forces:
for the body can be turned around in its path with the same speeds, if indeed in the return
motion the impressed forces are the same, as those in the departing motion, but to be
clearly in the opposite direction. Thus the planets would go round the sun in contrary
orbits, which now move in ellipses, if in the first place they had been sent off in a motion
contrary to these. For through the same element of distance, the effect of the force in
changing the speed is always the same, and for that reason it shall be negative, when the
body returns. Moreover the effect, which is devoted to changing the direction of motion
of the body, in each case remains the same, which is, that the body in coming and going
retraces the same path. But this will become more apparent below, where motion of this
kind will be established. But truly, if it is decreased by resistance, this similitude between
the ascending and the descending motion vanishes : for in each case the resistance to the
motion is made less, and neither is the effect of this on either of the other in the opposite
direction, as usually comes about for absolute forces acting.
Scholium 2.
252. Enough therefore with rectilinear motion, which arises from uniform forces, and it is
time to move on to different kinds of forces, which in different places exert other forces
on bodies, and that needs to be examined, for whatever the motions of the bodies, in as
much as they shall be on a straight line, they will vary from the above. Indeed all the
forces that we observe in the world suffer from this kind of difference, that no force can
be assigned to a body put in any place that will equally affect the body. Thus the planets,
where they are closer to the sun, [p. 100] are attracted to the sun by a stronger force; and
also where a body more removed from the surface of the earth, the weight or the exertion
downwards shall be less on that body. It almost comes about in the same manner, where
we observe the magnet to attract an iron filing more at shorter distances, and the
attraction to be weaker at greater distances. Therefore we will elicit the laws, for
whatever ratio of the forces with distance they hold, according to which the motion of
the body acted upon can be changed. And in the first place we are indeed to contemplate
forces that vary according to the distance of the body from a fixed point raised to some
power.
Definition 16.
253. That fixed point is called the centre of attraction, to which bodies are attracted by a
force, which depends on the distance from this point, or which is as some fraction of this
distance.
Corollary 1.
254. Therefore given the distance from this centre of force in which the body placed is
drawn to the centre by as large a force, as if it should be the force of gravity acting on
this, and placed on the surface of the earth.
Corollary 2.
255. Therefore with this distance and the law of the attraction known, clearly given by a
function of the distance, to which the attraction is proportional, the ratio of this force is
EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.
Chapter Three (part a).
Translated and annotated by Ian Bruce. page 109
known, for any position of the body trying to fall towards the centre of force, to the force
of gravity on the same body acted on if it should be on the surface of the earth. [p. 101]
Corollary 3.
256. Thus in this manner, any variable forces are allowed to be compared with the force
of gravity, since the effect of this force on the body is known, and thus also the effect of
any force on the body can be determined.
Scholium 1.
257. I put this attraction of the centres of the forces similar to the force of gravity, thus in
order that likewise the forces of different bodies placed in the same position are as the
masses themselves, and thus the magnitudes of the accelerations are all the same (212).
Therefore in handling these problems, it is not necessary to call upon the mass of the
body in the computation of the motion, but only the magnitude of the acceleration, to
which the force of attraction to the centre divided by the mass is in proportion. Moreover
it can be compared with the acceleration of the force of gravity, that we put equal to one,
and we will compare all the accelerations due to the magnitudes of these forces with this
acceleration of unity, clearly homogeneous quantities.
Corollary 4.
258. Thus when we talk about the forces as being as the distances from the centre of force
or proportional to a certain function of these, it is not only the forces that the bodies have
to the centre, but also the accelerations associated with these force, i. e. it is the ratio of
the force to the mass, that should be understood.
Corollary 5.
259. Therefore since the direction of the force which presses upon the body, always pulls
towards the centre of force, [p. 102] it is evident, if the body is either at rest or it has
motion, the direction of which passes through the centre of motion, then the body must be
moving on this straight line perpetually crossing through the centre of force (189).
Definition 17.
260. The force, which presses upon bodes to the centre of this kind of force, is called the
centripetal force. And that, if it is negative, in order that the body is repelled from the
centre, is called the centrifugal force.
Corollary 1.
261. Since this will be the question about the motion, the centripetal force will be for us
the magnitude of the acceleration, or the force pulling the body towards the centre
divided by the mass of the body.
EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.
Chapter Three (part a).
Translated and annotated by Ian Bruce. page 110
Corollary 2.
262. Therefore the effort or the striving that the body has towards the centre of force, is
expressed by the strength of the centripetal force [i. e. the acceleration] multiplied by the
mass of the body. On account of which it will be to the weight of the same body, if it
were put in place on the surface of the earth, as the strength of the centripetal force or the
strength of the acceleration to unity. (257).
Scholion.
263. Newton, who mainly talks about the centripetal force [in the Definitions in the
Principia], has paid attention to three ways in which the effects of the same can be
measured. In the first case, it provides a measure of the absolute quantity of the
effectiveness of the centre of the force, without regard to the [mass of the] body being
attracted ; thus he asserts, in the case of the larger loadstone the greater the absolute
quantity of the centripetal force present, and in the case of the lesser lodestone, the
corresponding centripetal force is smaller too [p. 103; See Def. VI. Principia ; though the
mass of the orbiting body would not cancel, if such a motion were possible, as in e/m
experiments with a uniform magnetic field.] And in a similar manner, following this
theorem, the absolute quantity is greater on the sun than it is on the earth. Moreover this
comparison is to be understood from the similarity of the centres of force, i. e. according
to the same function of the distances, and with attractions; indeed the comparison does
not have differences of this kind at the same place. Hence this absolute quantity of force
is to be measured from a known effort, which the body has exerted on it at a given
distance from the given centre of force. Moreover in place of this consideration, I put in
place the distance into which the body can be put with a force equal to its weight pushing
towards the centre (254). In the second place the strength of the centripetal force has the
magnitude of an acceleration, which is perceived by the senses at the object itself, where
the centripetal force itself is acting (261); indeed it is measured by the ratio of the effort
applied to the mass. In the third case, the strength of the centripetal force leads us to the
magnitude of the motive force, which is specified by the force the bodies experience on
approaching the centre of force; the motive force is the quantity of motion, and that is
usually measured by the product of the speed by the mass, and which is produced in a
given time proportional to this effort itself. And for this force p, and the mass A, the
increment in the speed in a given element of time varies as A
p (154), that multiplied by
the mass A gives the increment in the quantity of motion, that is proportional to the force
p.
[According to Cohen, on p. 406 of his translation of the Principia, which is very good on
this point, Newton's summary of the three effects of centripetal force are : absolute,
accelerative, and motive. One may take the first to mean that the centripetal force lies in
the category of absolute forces; the second that it involves an acceleration; and the third
that the momentum of the body is related to it from the impulse divided by time relation,
as Euler sketches above. One may raise the odd eyebrow at Def. 8, which tells us that it is
the opposing centrifugal force which prevents the body from falling...... Well!! It may
also be appropriate to note what the modern usage is by contrast, at least according to this
translator's understanding : Newton's Second Law, which he never actually enunciated

himself in the form 'F = ma ' is a cause – effect relation. The cause can be some
phenomenologically determined relation such as the law of universal gravitation,
Coulomb's law of electrostatics, etc: this takes care of the first property. The effect is
what the mass does in response. If the force is always applied at right angles to the
direction of motion, then we get the centripetal acceleration, which is a purely kinematic
quantity: which is the second property. The third property is an amalgamation of these
two, whereby the rate of change of momentum can be used as a measure of the central
force, as for example for a moon rotating around a planet, etc. This is all viewed in the
realm of classical physics. Newton was to correct his unfortunate assertion made above,
when he discussed cannon balls falling towards the centre of the earth when in orbit.]

PROBLEM.
264. Let C be the centre of the forces (Fig. 25) that attract bodies in some ratio of the
distance, and by this force a body at rest at A is drawn forwards; the speed of this body is
then sought at any point in the interval AC. [p. 104]

Let AC = a, AP = x; and the speed that the body has at P is that
corresponding to having fallen from the height v. The attraction shall be
given as the ratio of the distance raised to some power n, and f is taken as
the distance from C, at which the force on the body towards C is equal to
the weight of the body, if it should be placed on the surface of the earth.

towards C, will be as the strength of gravity, that I put equal to 1, as CPn,

Corollary 1.
265. If n + 1 is a positive number, yn + 1 vanishes when y = 0. Therefore in this case [p.

Corollary 2.
266. But if n + 1 = 0 or n = -1, the value found from the equation itself may not be
known on account of the numerator and the denominator vanishing. Because of this, it
will be necessary to repeat the differential equation. Moreover, it follows that xa

infinitely great; for it shall be that v = fl ∞ . This infinite step is to be deplored, and if a
nearby value is taken, it is finite ; however if n + 1 should exceed zero a little, then the
speed at C suddenly becomes finite.

Scholium 1.
269. Moreover, after the body arrives at C from A in C, where then it shall keep on
moving forwards, it is not so easy to be defined. Indeed it is observed, that if y is made
negative in the expression found, the height corresponding to the speed at Q should be
emerging ; which if it is positive, then the body again returns to Q ; but truly if it is
negative, from the evidence, this body never reaches beyond C into the region CQ. In
truth this way of continuing the motion is not always possible to be adhered to; often
indeed the hypothesis itself, by which the attractive force is placed before and beyond C
towards the centre is opposite. In as much as the body proving to be at P, since it is being
pulled down, when it arrives at Q, it is pushed up by an equal force, if CQ = CP. This
force, on account of the nature of the force which is acting on the body at Q, is negative
with the former ratio and thus is to be expressed by a negative quantity. Therefore the
force at P expressed by n

n
f
y

xa or
)( − must be the negative of itself, when – y is put in
place of y, and that never happens, unless n is either an odd number or a fraction, of
which the numerator and denominator are uneven. Therefore for these cases the value of
v is produces, when the body arrives at Q ; always in the remaining cases, since in
calculating the force acting on the body at Q when indeed with the value not in
agreement, the quantity elicited for the letter v is not the true value [p. 107]. If indeed n
is an even number, the attracting force at Q by making y negative is equal to the force at
P and clearly falls in the same place. From which it shall be, that as the body crosses the
centre C on the line CQ must continue to fall to infinity, that calculation also makes
clear. Because when it disagrees with the hypothesis, it is seen that in these cases the
motion of the body, after it has arrived at C, cannot be defined by the formula defined.
Moreover it is seen to be more absurd, when 2
1=n or another fraction of this kind, which
changes yn into an imaginary quantity with –y put in place of y; because that may
indicate that that not only is the body not attracted to C, but the force of attraction also
becomes imaginary, which is indeed not possible to understand.

equal to that which it had before at P, if indeed CQ = CP. Therefore the motion is equal
in the manner in which the body recedes in the direction CQ, by which before it
approached along AC; and it shall reach as far as B, thus in order that CB = AC, where it
loses all its speed. And thus it reverts again in the same way to C, and then it arrives at A
again. Which reciprocal motion, unless decreased by friction, will be carried out

that the body never goes beyond C. Hence another judgement is seen to be brought down,

272. Indeed this is seen to be less in agreement with the truth; for the reason is hardly
apparent why the body with its infinite speed that it acquires at C should be about to
progress into CB rather than another region, especially when the direction of this infinite
speed should follow into this region. But whatever it shall be, here the calculation rather
than our judgement being trusted and established, the jump if it is made from the infinite
to the finite, is not thoroughly understood. Moreover, this opinion is further confirmed
by a similar example for which a full explanation is given below, (665), if n = – 2; for in
this case the speed of the body arriving at C is also infinite and directed along CB ; by no
less truth, in this case the body does not progress beyond C, but suddenly reverts from C
equally and approaches towards A. From which it is understood, that as often as an
infinite speed should arise at C, judgement about the further motion of the body should be
suspended. So for the time being only this shall be done, until we come to considering
motion along curves [p. 109] ; and with these indeed which are rectilinear, and [the
resolution of this problem is] clearly connected to these(762). For neither then is the
calculation which is put in place subject to this inconvenience, as it is in disagreement
with the hypothesis ; but whatever is put equal to the centripetal force is not in opposition
to the calculation.
Scholion 3.
273. But always, when the speed at C is not infinitely great, because that happens, when
the size of the number n + 1 is positive, the whole motion of the body is known by our
judgement, even if the calculation is insufficient. For if the speed at C is finite and has the
direction along CB, that by necessity is should have, then it may not be possible to
happen, as no motion can be continued along CB. But in a like manner the motion may be
continuing to recede from C, when before it was approaching along AC, and at some
point Q it has the same speed that before it had at the point P placed at an equal distance
from C, thus as can be understood from § 251. Therefore the motion occurs perpetually
between A to B and back again, and in returning the body completes the motion.

PROBLEM.
274. With the attraction from the centre C (Fig. 26) to be in some ratio of a multiple of
the distances, the body at D now has a given speed ; the point A is required on the line
CD produced, from which the descent of the body towards C begins, so that it has
acquired this speed when it arrives at D. [p. 110]
SOLUTION.
With n denoting as above the exponent of the ratio of multiplication,
in what shall be the centripetal force, and f the distance at which the
centripetal force is equal to the force of gravity; let CD = b, the speed at
D corresponding to the height h, and the distance CA sought which is put
equal to q. Since here therefore q denotes that same distance as a [i. e.
CA] in the above proposition, and b likewise that of y [i. e. CP], and h
likewise here represents v, this equation is formed: n

275. If the centripetal force varies directly as the distance, then n = 1 and

Likewise it arises, provided n + 1 is a positive number. And also in the case n = - 1 the
distance q is never infinite.

Corollary 5.
279. If this problem is joined with the preceding one, the motion of the body can be
easily determined, since it begins to descent to C from B with the speed h . From the
preceding indeed the descent of the body is observed to be made from A, since it begins
to descend in the part from D with the speed h , CP is called equal to y, and the speed,
that the body has at P, corresponding to the height v, is )1(

280. From this expression for v, when the descent begins from D with the speed

h.

281. Since the time delay, in which the distance AC or any part of this is completed for
any hypothetical centripetal force (Fig. 25), that is easily known from the known speeds.

the time to traverse AP is found to equal

which quantity generally neither can be integrated nor reduced to the quadrature of any

account of which from the general case set out, particular special cases will be examined
in the following propositions.

PROPOSITION 34. PROBLEM.

282. If the centripetal force is in proportion to the distance from the centre C (Fig. 27)
and the body falls from A as far as C, [p. 113] it is required to determine the time in
which the body completes any part of this distance.
SOLUTION.
With AC = a, and the distance from the centre C, in
which the centripetal force is equal to the force of
gravity , equal to f, some part of the distance CP = y and
the speed at P corresponding to the height v. Therefore
the time, in which the distance CP is completed, is equal
to ∫ v
dy ; with the fraction 250
1 ignored, since this can be
used for the known time in seconds and can be added as
desired. Truly from Prop. 32 (264) by making n = 1

Upon AC the quadrant of a circle is constructed AME, and to this the lines CE and PM as

ady . On account of which the
time to traverse PC becomes = a
fEM 2. . The time therefore of the total descent through
AC will be a
fAME 2. . Hence the time of descent through AP = a
fAM 2. . From these
therefore the time of descent through any distance travelled through can become known,
and that in seconds, if these expressions are divided by 250 and the length f is shown in
thousandth parts of Rhenish feet. Q. E. I.
Corollary 1.
283. Let 1 : π denote the ratio of the diameter to the circumference , then it becomes
2AME : a = π : 1 and 2
π=a
AME . Hence on account of this, the time of descent through
AC is equal to f22
π . [p. 114] Since that does not depend on the height dropped or
travelled through a, but whatever amount this shall be, it keeps the same value. Therefore
all bodies, which are released towards this centre, reach that in equal amounts of time.

284. This equality of the time follows from the expression for the time f
ya
2
)( 22 − , in
which a and y are required to have one dimension. Indeed the amount comes about, the
times, in which any distances a are travelled through, must be equal to each other. (46).
Corollary 2.
285. If besides there should be another of centre of force of this kind, but with a different
effectiveness provided, thus in order that the distance at which the centripetal force is
equal to the force of gravity is F, the times of the descents shall be to each other as
Ff ad . But the effectiveness of each are themselves in this case in the inverse ratio
of the distances f : F; indeed these are as the forces, which these forces exercise at equal
distances. Wherefore the times of descent to the different centres of force are in the
inverse ratio of the square roots of their effectiveness. Which ratio indeed holds in all
similar centres of force in place, if the distances traversed are equal to each other, as will
be taught in what follows.
