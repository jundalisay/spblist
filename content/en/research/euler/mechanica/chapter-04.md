DEFINITION 18

367. The law of the resistance is the force or function of the speed of the body, to which
the resistance is in proportion. Thus if the resistance is proportional to the square of the
speed, the law of the resistance is the square of the speed.

Corollary 1.

368. Therefore it is known from the law of the resistance, if many equal points are carried
forwards with different speeds, how their motions diminish between themselves. And
from the given decrease in the speed of one point the decreases in the speeds of the rest
can also be found.

Corollary 2.

369. If therefore from one step in the speed given for the ratio of the resistance to the
force of gravity, for all the other steps too the ratio between the resistance and the force
of gravity can be found from the law of the resistance. And from this the effect of the
resistance on the motion of the body can be found.

Scholium 1.

370. Certainly the strength of the resistance extends as far as the general idea of force and
thus it is homogeneous with the force of gravity, as this will become apparent when the
motion of bodies in fluids is treated. Therefore an absolute force can always be assigned
to produce the same effect on the body as resistance. Truly this absolute force will always
depend on the speed of the body, since on this account, in the expression of this, the
speed or the height corresponding to the speed will be present. Therefore in this way the
motion of the body in a medium with resistance is reduced to the motion of a body acted
on by an absolute force, since the laws will have been set out as in the second chapter
above, from which all the questions can be resolved. [Thus, one assumes that the
medium is at rest, so that absolute forces are acting.]

Scholium 2.

371. The direction of the force of the resistance in this tract of ours will always be in
agreement with the motion of the body and in the opposite direction (117). On account of
which the absolute force to be substituted for that will always be one of retardation, with
the direction of the motion not changed. And thus it is evident that the expression for the
resistive force is made negative as often as the body moves in a contrary direction, and
that motion is one of being accelerated. Indeed it is not possible to have this case for a
body at rest at a point in a fluid, but yet in the calculation this often occurs for the given
motion of the body in the fluid investigated.

Corollary 3.

372. Therefore the motion of a body in a fluid with resistance, if not acted on by any
other force, must be to move in a straight line. For since the direction of the motion is not
changed by a resistive force, the motion of the body, that naturally peruses a straight line,
must always by necessity be made in the same straight line.

Corollary 4.

373. If in addition an absolute force is acting, the direction of which is always in the same
direction as the motion, then the body in the resistive medium also proceeds in a straight
line. For neither will this absolute force nor the resistive force change the direction of the
motion.

Scholium 3.

374. Therefore in this chapter, in which we have only established for rectilinear motion to be explained, we do not join other absolute forces with the resistive force, except when
their directions agrees with the direction of the motion. On account of this, it is possible
to consider all the forces that we have used in the preceding chapter with resistance to be
included. Moreover before we go forwards to absolute forces, it will be convenient to put
the motion of bodies impeded by a single resistive force under scrutiny, from which it
will be easier for us to progress from simpler to more complex situations.
[p. 156]
Scholium 4.

375. In the expression of the law of resistance or in that function of the speed, besides the
height corresponding to the speed v there can be constant quantities present, but we
exclude all variable quantities depending on the motion of the body. Indeed it may
happen that the resistance experienced by a wide body with equal speeds, shall be greater
or less as that body goes from one place to another; as happens when the fluid in which
the body moves is denser in one place and indeed rarer in another, in which case it is
necessary to take into account the position in the expression for the resistance. Yet
neither is it appropriate to consider the position in the law governing the resistance we
wish to express, for in that account of the resistance when the body is put in the same
place with various speeds. Truly the distinction that can arise from the variation in the
position, we understand to be in the exponent of the resistance, which likewise indicates the intensities of the resistances. [By intensity Euler means the force per unit mass or the contribution to the acceleration or deceleration associated with the force acting on the
body.]

DEFINITION 19

376. The exponent of the resistance is the height corresponding to its speed, which if the
body has this speed, then the resistance experienced is equal to the force of gravity. It is
clear that in this case the body is slowed down by the resistance to the same extent as it
would be slowed in moving up under the force of gravity. [The exponent of the resistance
is hence a constant associated with that resistive force, indicating its strength. In certain
circumstances where the resistance varies with position, then it is not a constant, as
explained below. For uniform resistance it is constant. The resistance is given as a
negative acceleration of the form − ( kv ) , where v is the height the body falls under
n
constant unit acceleration due to gravity, corresponding to the speed
whole number power.]
v , and n is a
Corollary 1.
377. Therefore if the body in the resisting medium has a motion corresponding to an
altitude v and this altitude v is equal to the exponent of the resistance, then [p. 157]
the body progresses through the element of distance dx, where dv = – dx ; since in this
case the resistive force is equivalent to the force of gravity, that we always put equal to 1,
and the motion is slowed down.
Corollary 2.
378. Therefore with the law and the exponent of the resistance given, the diminution of
the motion can be defined. Accordingly from the known exponent, what size of speed
the body should have, in order that the resistive force is equal to the force of gravity, and
from the given law of the resistance, then the ratio is known, according to which different
speeds are lessened by the resistance.
Scholium.
379. The exponent of the resistance is either a constant, or a variable, or depends on the
location of the body. The first mentioned happens in a medium or uniform fluid, which
has the same resistance acting on bodies everywhere, if they move everywhere with the
same speed. A resistive medium of this kind we will call uniform, clearly which is the
same to the body in all places. Moreover the exponent of the resistance is variable in a
medium or fluid that is not uniform, even if the resistance follows the same law in
separate place also. For when the fluid or medium is denser, in which the body moves
about, in that too the body experiences the greater resistance, which is equal to the speed
of the motion [due to gravity] also. Cleary the resisting speed equal to gravity is greater
in a rarer medium, less in a more dense medium. Moreover since dense and rare
mediums depend of the location, it is evident [p. 158] that the exponent of the resistance,
if it is variable, must depend on the location of the body.


DEFINITION 20

380. Here resistive mediums are called similar that have the same law of resistance.
Truly these mediums are dissimilar which have different laws of resistance. Thus water
and mercury are mediums of the same kind, accordingly as both have fluids resist in the
ratio of the square of the speeds.
Corollary.
381. Therefore if the resistances of similar media are different from each other, then the
whole difference is consistent with the exponent of the resistance or with the density and
rarity. Thus in water the exponent of the resistance is greater than in quicksilver, since
this fluid is denser than that.
Scholium.
382. Similar mediums with bodies with equal speeds are able to acquire different
resistances, since the densities of these are different from each other, and it can be agreed
to measure these densities from the resistances imparted to the bodies with a given speed.
Indeed in fluids, as with the motion of the body performed in the fluid, it is taught, that
for bodies with equal speeds, the resistances are in proportion to the densities of the
fluids. We transfer this property to the resistance of any other mediums whatever the law
governing the resistance : since other laws besides the ratio of the square of the speed [p.
159] are purely imaginary and they are accustomed to be used as exercises in analysis
only.

PROBLEM.
383. For a body moving along the line AP (Fig. 37) in a medium with some kind of
resistance, both the law and the exponent of which are known, with a given speed at the
point P, to find the decrease in the speed as the element of distance Pp is traversed.
SOLUTION.
With the element Pp = dx let the altitude
corresponding to the speed at P be equal to v and the
exponent of the resistance be equal to q. Therefore √q
denotes the speed, which if the body has at P, then the
force of the resistance will equal the strength of gravity,
which in turn is equal to 1. On account of which, if v = q, then the resistive force is equal
to 1 and dv = - dx (376, 377). Moreover let V be that function of the speed √v , by which
the law of the resistance is expressed, and Q designates a similar function of √q, or Q is a
quantity of that kind, which is produced if q is substituted in place of v in V. ThereforeEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

when the motion is slowed, will be dv = −Vdx
Q
Corollary 1.
384. Since the quantity V is a function of v and of a constant, and q likewise, and Q is
either a constant or some function of x (375), the equation found dv = −Vdx
can be freely
Q
separated. For we have dv
= −Qdx , from which by integration or even by construction the
V
whole motion of the body along AP is known.
Corollary 2.
385. Since the force of resistance is equal to VQ , the density of the medium can be found
from this. Since indeed the density is measured from the resistance, that the body
experiences moving with the given speed, it is necessary to substitute a constant quantity
in V in place of v, with which done the resistance is found to vary as Q1 . Therefore the
Q
density of the medium also will be as Q1 , or inversely with Q.
Scholium.
386. Here VQ denotes not only the force acting, but now the strength of the retarding
resistance itself [It is now clear that Euler identifies the strength of a force with the
acceleration it produces], on account of which there is no need for the mass of the body to
be included in the calculation. Moreover here the mass of the body is constant or we put
the masses of many bodies equal to each other. Indeed I have agreed not to deliberate
about this here, which will only come to be used in a single case, except to extend the
necessity to return to more complicated cases. [p. 161]

387. In a medium with uniform resistance, that offers resistance in some power of the
speed, to define the speed of the moving body at particular places.
SOLUTION.
Let the body be moving along the right line AP (Fig. 37), and its speed at the point A
corresponds to the altitude c. The distance travelled through AP = x , and the height
corresponding to the speed at P is equal to v. The exponent of the resistance, which is
constant, is called k, and the law of the resistance is v m , thus in order that the resistance
everywhere shall be as the power 2m of the exponent of the speed. Therefore in theEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Truly in the single case, [p. 162] when m = 1, it cannot be found from these formulas, but
should be derived from the equation of the differential, which with m = 1 is of this kind :
dv = − dx ,the integral of which is lv = C − x . Indeed in a similar manner, C = lc and

thus lv = lc − kx . With the logarithms reduced to numbers, therefore it is found that :

on the line AP. Q. E. I.

Corollary 1.
388. If the resistance of the medium is proportional to the squares of the speeds, then m =
1. On account of which in this case, which is thought to be the only kind of resistance
found in nature, the case of the singular solution v = ce− k prevails. From which it is
apparent that the body does not lose the whole speed before x traverses an infinite
distance.

Moreover it is evident from this equation that the speed does not vanish unless x is made

initial speed was infinitely great, it would with that great amount everywhere. Truly inEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Therefore v always has a finite magnitude, unless x = 0 or = ∝ .
Corollary 4.
391. Besides in this case, when m > 1, the body,
before it reaches the point A, always somewhere,
such as C (Fig. 38), has a speed of infinite
magnitude. In order that the point C can be
found, it is necessary for x to become negative,
and k m + ( m − 1 )c m −1x to be put equal to zero. Hence it is found that AC =

Corollary 5.
392. If the resistance were in a ratio less than the square of the speed, likewise m < 1, and
it is found that :

Therefore the speed of the body vanishes at the point C (Fig. 37), if AC = c1− m
Consequently, when the body arrives at C, it will perpetually remain at rest there and not
progress further.
Corollary 6.
393. If m is put equal to zero, the resistance is constant and acts equally on the body
either at rest or moving. Therefore in this case the resistance departs from being a force
and is equivalent to the strength of gravity. For since, if v = k, the resistance is made
equal to the strength of gravity, and also for whatever other speed the body may have, it
still experiences the same resistance.[p. 164]
Scholium 1.
394. In these corollaries we have explained the first difference of the motions, if m were
equal to one, or greater or less than one. Indeed these differences can be understood from
these short rules : if m = 1, the body neither has an infinite speed or zero speed anywhere
in the whole distance. Then if m > 1, the body must have an infinite speed somewhere,
and indeed the speed never vanishes. Finally if m < 1, the body has a zero speed
somewhere, and indeed an infinite speed nowhere.
Scholium 2.
395. This diminution of the speed remains the same, in whatever place the body is
moving, since the same resistance was shown everywhere. Unless indeed this motion is
similar to that which is diminished by a contrary absolute force acting, where it happens
that a body in a different place is accelerated as much as it was retarded before. But for
the diminished motion in a resistive medium to be restored and again to be equallyEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

accelerated, and before it was being diminished, it is necessary for a negative force of
resistance to be in place and thus to be changed into a propelling force. Then indeed the
equation becomes : dv = Vdx
, from which it is apparent that the speed is to be increased
Q
by the same amount, that before it was diminished. Thus with the resistive force changed
into a propelling force, the motion of the body would be made backwards, and it thus
reverts from P to A, in order that it recovers the same speed at the individual points of the
interval AP that it had everywhere before. [p. 165]
Scholion 3.
396. In the cases, in which m < 1 and finally the body has arrived at rest, the same
difficulty occurs, of which mention has been made above (316), if we wish the motion to
be changed with the force of resistance converted into a force of propulsion. For if the
m
speed of the body is zero when it arrives at C , the propelling force v m also vanishes, if
k
indeed m is not a negative number, and on this account the body is never able to leave the
place C. Therefore in this case a decreasing motion is not able to be changed into an
increasing motion. Indeed the calculation shows the opposite, for if it is said that CP = y,
( 1− m ) y
. Moreover from that
km
equation it follows that that is absurd, hence it is apparent, that the exponent 1−1m of y is
the height corresponding to the speed at P, is clearly v = 1− m
greater than unity, and thus in the graph of the heights for the corresponding speeds, the
line AC is a tangent at C. Indeed as often as this happens, the body is never able to leave
the point C, even if the calculation may point out otherwise (319).

Corollary 1.
398. If therefore the resistance is in proportion to the square of the speed and
consequently m = 1, the time, in which the body describes an infinite distance, obviously
as long as it loses all of its motion, is also infinite.
Corollary 2.
399. If indeed m > 1, then also 2m > 1, and consequently the formula found expressing
the time to travel through AP has been correctly set out. Moreover from that the time is
apparent, while the moving body loses the whole motion, is infinite, which is easily seen
from this, since the distance too is infinite. (389).

traverse in order to lose all its speed, is 2 ck (392), and the time in which this distance is
traversed is infinite.
Corollary 8.
406. Therefore from all these gathered together, the time is infinite in which the body
loses all its speed if 2m is either equal to or greater than one; truly otherwise, if 2m is less
than one, the whole time of the motion is finite.
Scholium 2.
407. If the force of resistance is changed into one of propulsion, in which case the
motion becomes backward and is increased in a similar manner, from which before it was
being diminished, the times ought to be the same, which have been defined here. For
since the speed of the body at the individual points of the interval AP is the same, either
carried from A to P by a retarding motion, [p. 170] or in turn from P in A with one of
acceleration, it is not possible to distinguish the time between each. But yet in these
cases, in which the whole interval AC is completed in a finite time, this rule does not
apply, since a body at rest at C experiences no force of propulsion (396). Truly we are
always able to have confidence in this rule, if bodies are given a finite speed initially.

PROBLEM.
408. A body that is moving in some medium with resistance, is acted on by some absolute
force; to determine the increase or decrease of the speed, while it runs through any
element Pp (Fig. 39).
SOLUTION.
Let the speed of the body at P correspond to the altitude v and the element to be
traversed be Pp = dx. Again let the absolute force or rather the accelerating strength of
this at P = p and the exponent of the resistance is equal to q. V designates that function of
v, to which the resistance is proportional, and Q is such a function of q, as V is of v. From
these put in place the body is slowed down, as it is moved through the element Pp, by
the strength of the resistance VQ (383); meanwhile likewise it is accelerated by the
absolute force [i.e. acceleration or force per unit mass] p. On account of which the body
is accelerated in travelling through the element Pp by a strength of force equal to p - VQ .
From which it follows that dv = pdx − VQ dx . Q. E. I. [p. 171]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

[As expressed earlier, the reader may wish to consider this in modern terms as a work
– energy equation : the work done per unit mass against a constant gravitational field of
intensity 1 is equal to the work done per unit mass by the applied external force from
which is taken the work done against the frictional force, the constant of proportionality
of which is 1/Q, also per unit mass. Euler of course could not be completely familiar with
this interpretation, although Daniel Bernoulli used similar expressions in his work,
corresponding to the modern idea of potential energy. This was highly convenient for
Euler, as he could obtain a differential equation in terms of distances only, and bring in
the time later via the known speed differential.]
Corollary 1.
409. If therefore it is the case that p > VQ , then the speed of the body travelling through
the element Pp is increased; but truly for p < VQ , the speed of this is diminished. And if it
is the case that p = VQ , then the speed is neither increased or decreased, but remains
unchanged in traversing the element Pp.
Corollary 2.
410. If the absolute force were contrary to the motion and retarding it, then
dv = − pdx − VQ dx . Therefore in this case the body is retarded by each force.
Scholium 1.
411. If the absolute force pulls the body downwards, according to the solution of the
problem we have put in place, and the body is moving up, both the absolute force and the
resistance force are in the contrary direction. Therefore this equation is then obtained :
dv = − pdx − VQ dx . From which it is apparent that the motion of the ascent is not the same
as the motion of the descent, since the strength acting in the ascent is not in the negative
ratio of the force acting in the descent. When therefore the ascent is the same as the
descent and the motion in both cases has the same speed at the same point, it is required
that the strength of the resistance in the ascent is changed into a propelling force. With
which done we have the equation : dv = − pdx + VQ dx , from which equation it is evident
that the ascending body through Pp is to be retarded just as much as it was accelerating in
the descent. [p. 172]
Scholium 2.
412. The equation found : dv = pdx − VQ dx with the sum extended, on account of the
defective analysis, can neither be separated or constructed; and because of this the speed
of the body at P cannot be determined. Therefore a much shorter time, in which the
distance AP is completed must be assigned. Hence it is necessary to abandon this general
equation and to examine particular cases of descents and ascents in which the equationEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

can be separated and the speed defined. There are three ways in which the separation of
the equations in the unknowns x and v can be admitted. The first of these is, if x does not
have more than one dimension. The second, if v only maintains a single dimension. The
third case occurs, if x and v likewise everywhere make a number of the same dimension,
or if the equation can be reduced to the aforesaid property.
Corollary 3.
413. In the first case therefore we have, if p and q are constants; for then, since Q is a
Qdv
constant, there is produced dx = pQ −V , in which the indeterminates [or unknowns] are
separated from each other in turn. Besides truly also the equation can be separated , if we

, which, since V depends on v
put p = QA . Then indeed the equation becomes : Adv

and Q on x , it is possible to construct a solution.
Corollary 4.
414. When v has a single dimension, it is required that V = v, in which case also Q = q,
and [p. 173] the equation of the general form will be changed in this case
, which allows the separation of the unknowns.

Corollary 5.
415. From which it is apparent, when a homogeneous equation will soon be formed, let
V = vα and q = x β ; then Q = x αβ . Again let p = xγ , and v is computed with δ
dimensions, since x has one dimension. With these put in place, that equation is changed
into this : dv = xγ dx - v αβdx , in the second case γ + 1 dimensions and in the third

αδ + 1 − αβ . Therefore we must have δ = γ + 1 and
γ + 1 = αγ + α + 1 − αβ or γ ( α − 1 ) = α ( β − 1 ) . Therefore as often as we have the ratio
α − 1 : α = β − 1 : γ , so also the equation can be reduced to the homogeneous form and
therefore that speed determined.
Scholium 3.
416. In place of V, q, and p no other functions are permitted to be formed except the
powers of v and of x themselves. For, since a power of x cannot be present in V and
neither q nor p can enter v, and above the number of the dimensions of x and v
themselves everywhere must be the same or be able to be reduced to the same, in place of
these quantities by necessity the powers ought to be assumed. On this account, I have put
V = vα , q = x β and p = xγ and I have extracted the above ratio α − 1 : α = β − 1 : γ . I have
neglected certain coefficients, which can safely be added in this reduction, for with these
the homogeneity cannot be disturbed. Thus I can put q = Bx β and p = Cxγ , with the
same ratio kept. [p. 174] For x truly not only the distance traversed AP can be substituted,
but increased by some other constant, provided the differential of this is dx or someEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Corollary 6.
417. If the resisting medium is uniform medium and thus β = 0, then α − 1 : α = −1 : γ .
Hence γ = 1α-α . Whereby if the law of the resistance is vα , then the absolute force must

SOLUTION.
Keeping as before AP = x (Fig. 39), with the speed at P = v , let the uniform force be
equal to g, and the exponent of the resistance equal to k. Since the resistance law is v, the
strength of the resistance is equal to kv . From which it follows that

v = gk ( 1 − e k ) , which expression, when a greater x is taken, is also made larger, yet a
certain limit can never be exceeded. For by taking x =∝ then it is found that v = gk.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Therefore gk is the asymptotic speed of descent of the body, that it had not acquired

423. If the initial speed c is greater than gk , then e k ( c − gk ) is a positive quantity,

which the body falls in a vacuum only under the action of an absolute force. And indeed

[Thus, if the force acts on unit mass, then the variables for the force and the
acceleration have the same magnitude. As we have mentioned previously, the Latin vi
can be a general term for force, strength, or power, and can also be used to express
acceleration as the force on a unit mass. The use of the word potentia is usually more
explicit, and requires the force to be defined by some formula. This is contrary to
accepted wisdom, which regards the words vi and potentia to relate to absolute and
relative forces, at least as defined by D. Speiser in his analysis of the works of Daniel
Bernoulli. However, this does not seem to be the case for Euler's works, who seems
occasionally to use the words as synonyms, and at other times as we have said here. In
the final analysis you the reader must make up your own mind as to what Euler is saying;
any comments made by me are my own views at the time, which can change as more of
the work is examined.]

434. If a body in a medium with uniform resistance, which resists in the
square ratio, is projected up again from B with a given speed, and is acted
upon by a given uniform force g, (Fig. 40), it is required to determine the
speed of the body at individual places.
SOLUTION.
Let the speed at B = c and the speed at P = v , put BP = x and the
exponent of the resistance equal to k. [p. 182] Since now the motion is
retarded by the absolute force g and by the resistance kv , then

e k = 1 − kx . Therefore in this case, v = c − gx. And the same equation is

Moreover when the value of this quantity is to be shown as an approximation of v, [p.

438. Now we turn our attention to the case where the descent of the body through AB is
not similar to the ascent, if the medium in each case can be resisting. Yet the descent
along AB can be conceived by thinking about the case which is similar in a straight
forwards way to the ascent, thus as the body in the ascent so in the descent at the point P
has the same speed and the medium is one that propels [rather than retards; a purely
hypothetical case obviously for mechanical systems, though energy can be removed and
then restored in electrical systems if we are talking about electric currents]. For since in
the ascent it is necessary that both the forces oppose the motion, as in the descent, each
force is set up following the motion, from which the motion is completely backwards.

in alio loco est densius, in alis vero rarius, quo casu in resistentiae expressione loci

378. Datis ergo lege et exponente resistentiae motus diminutio potest difiniri. Namque ex
exponente intelligitur, quantam corpus habere deberet celeritatem, ut resistentiae vis
aequalis esset gravitati, ex ex lege resistentiae cognoscitur ratio, secundum quam diversae
celeritates a resistentia deminuuntur.
Scholion.
379. Exponens resistentiae est vel constans vel variabilis seu a loco, in quo est corpus,
pendens. Illud accidit in medio seu fluido uniformi, quod corporibus ubique eandem
resistentiam infert, si quidem eadem ubique moveantur celeritate. Huiusmodi medium
resistens appellabimus uniforme, quippe quod in omnibus locis sui est simile. Exponens
autem resistentiae variabilis est in medio seu fluido difformi, etiamsi in quoque loco
seorsim resistentia eandem teneat legem. Nam quo densius est fluidum seu medium, in
quo corpus versatur, eo quoque maiorem patitur corpus resistentiam aequali etiam motum
celeritate. Maior scilicet erit celeritas resistentiam gravitati aequalem patiens in fluido
rariore, minor vero in densiore. Quia autem densitas [p. 158] et raritas medii a loco
pendet, per spicuum est resistentiae exponentem, si est variabilis, a loco corporis pendere
debere.
DEFINITIO 20
380. Media resistentia similia hic vocantur, quae eandem habent resistentiae legem.
Dissimilia vero, quae resistentiae lege differunt. Sic aqua et mercurius sunt hiusmodi
media similia, siquidem ambo haec fluida resistunt, uti videntur, in duplicata celeritatum
ratione.
Corollarium.
381. Si ergo media resistentia similia inter se differunt, tota differentia consistit in
exponente resistestiae seu densitate et raretate. Sic in aqua exponens resistentiae est
maior quam in argento vivo, quia hoc est fluidum densius illo.
Scholion.
382. Media similia cum corporibus aequaliter celeribus diversas facere queant
resistentias, prout eorum densitates inter se differunt, has ipsas densitates ex resistentia,
quam corpori data celeritate moto inferunt, metiri convenit. In fluidis enim, ut, cum de
motu corporum in fluido agitur, docetur, resistentiae aequalibus celeritatibus sunt
densitatibus fluidorum proportionales. Hancque proprietatem ad alia media quamcunque
resistentiae legem tenentia transferimus : quia aliae resistentiae [p. 159] leges praeter

motum tantumdem acceleretur, quantum ante erat retardatum. Sed ad motum in medio
resistente diminutum restituendum atque rursus pariter accelerandum, ac ante
diminuebatur, oportet vim resistantiae negativam statui atque ita in vim propellentem

quantum ante minuebatur. Vi ergo resistente in propellentem transmutata motus corporis

difficultas, cuius supra (316) mentio est facta, si motum transmutanda vi resistents in

nulla, vis propellens v m quoque evanescit, si quidem m non est numerum negativus, et

hanc ob rem nunquam ex loco C corpus poterit depelli. Hoc igitur casu motus
