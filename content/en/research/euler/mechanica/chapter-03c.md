PROPOSITION 36. PROBLEM

290. To determine the times of descent through the distance AC to the centre of the force C (Fig. 28),if the centripetal force is proportional to the reciprocal of the distances +1 , with the number m denoting a
considered, and the exponent of this distance is 22m

SOLUTION.

With a, f, y, and v retaining the same values as above, then let n = −22mm−−11 .Concerning

from which with y = 0 put in place the integral vanishes, as required. From which

Moreover since the time for the whole descent arises when y = a or z = b, i. e. u = 0,
then only the constant quantity C remains for the value of the integral of z
with a restored in place of 2b

amount m is a positive integer. Therefore in these cases the time can be shown by a finite
algebraic expression. Q. E. I.

Corollary 1.

291. Let m = 1, in which case n = - 3, and the series is equal to 1; therefore the time of

descent through AC arises equal to a 2

Corollary 2.

292. Let m = 2, in which case n = −35 , and the value of the series is 23 , and the time of

Corollary 3.

293. From these, the value of the sum of the general series is gathered to be equal
2.4.6...( 2m − 2)
to 3.5.7...(2m −1) . Therefore the time of descent in general is given by :
2.4.6...( 2m − 2) a
3.5.7...( 2m −1) f

2 m −1
2m
2 m −1
2(2m − 1) f .
If indeed n = −22mm−−11 or m = 2nn−+11 , where m is a positive integer.

Corollary 4.

294. Therefore with the successive positive values 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. put in place for m, the following values of the series constitute a progression 1, 32 , 32..54 , 32..54..76 etc., in which it is conceded that circle quadrature can be shown from the intermediate term. For if m = 12 , the corresponding terminus [i. e. limit] is found to be π2 , with 1 : π denoting the ratio of the diameter to the circumference, if m = 32 , the corresponding terminus is 12 . π2 , and thus again if m denotes 52 , 72 , 92 etc. . these terms arise : 12..34..π2 , 12..34..56..π2 , 12..34..56..78..π2 etc.

[Note initially that since m is no longer a positive integer, the series for the descent
time does not end, and the finite product for the finite sum becomes an infinite product
for an infinite sum. The Wallis infinite product was well known to Euler, and the relevant

formula in E019 : 'De Progressionibus Transcentibus, seu quarum termini generales
algebraice dari nequeunt.', or Concerning transcendental progressions, or those for which
the general terms cannot be given algebraically, in which Euler sets out his ideas, most
of which relate to the beta functions B(m, n), which can be viewed as generalised
binomial coefficients turned into functions either of real or complex variables; a
translation of this paper has been given by Stacy G. Langton, which is available from the
Euler Archive. Later we will evaluate Euler's integrals using the properties of Beta and
Gamma functions, which indicate that there may be a discrepancy by a factor of 1⁄2 in
Euler's values.

In the above paper, Euler considers initially the following general infinite product,
from which the product for n = 12 above can be derived as a special case :

between integer values. There was no thought of convergence or divergence in these
days. Thus, on setting n = 12 , he finds that (and we include the working as it seems interesting) :
Π ( 12 ) = 1. 3 2 • 25. 3 • 37. 4 • 49. 5 • etc = 2 . 4 • 4 . 6 • 6 . 8 • 8. 10 • etc =

using the appropriate B(m, n) integrals. Thus, if we start with the above integral
∫ z (b−dzz ) , which can be written in the form ∫ b z (1−dzz / b ) , and on defining z' = z/b, we

have dz' = dz/b, and z m −1 = b m −1z 'm −1 hence the integral becomes

= x m−1 (1− x ) n−1 dx integrated between 0 and 1. In this case the integrals are thus B(m, 2 ).

Then, in the first instance, when m = 2 , the integral becomes B( 2 , 2 ). Beta functions
are evaluated from their associated Gamma functions, according to the definition :
B(m,n) =
Γ(m)Γ(n)
Γ(m + n)
2
Hence, B( 12 , 12 ) = Γ (1/ 2) = π . This does not agree with Euler's result, which is π/2.

Similarly, when m = 32 , the value of the integral is B( 32 , 2 ), which is hence equal to
Γ (3 / 2), Γ (1 / 2)
=
Γ ( 2)
π /2 π

= 1 .π , which is Euler's first result. Again, when m =

5 , the integral

becomes Γ(5 / 2),Γ(1 / 2) = 3 π / 4 π = 3π = 1.3 π ; and if m = 72 , then the integral becomes

Γ (7 / 2), Γ (1 / 2) 1.3.5 π / 8 π

= 1.3.5 π , etc. Thus, it appears that Euler's results differ by a factor

of 2 consistently from what has been written down here by referring to a table of Gamma
functions and their properties. Perhaps he thought that his first integral gave the Wallis
result π/2 rather than π. Someone may feel inclined to do some more work on this issue,
(as there may be a mistake in the E019 paper). We will of course use Euler's values for
his integrals henceforth.]

Corollary 5.

295. Therefore the time of descent through AC is known in these cases also. For if m =
1 ,then in this case n = − ∝ , in which case the time is always indefinitely small. [p. 120]

Therefore let m = 23 , and n becomes equal to - 2, and the descent time is equal to
