PROPOSITION 35. PROBLEM.

286. If the centripetal force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from
the centre C (Fig.28) and the body falls from A as far as C, the time is to be found in
which the body traverses any portion of this distance AC.
SOLUTION.
By keeping AC = a and the distance, in which the centripetal force of gravity is equal
to f, and CP = y and the speed at P corresponds to the height v. Therefore, on account of
n = – 2 , by Prop. 32 (264),
a− y

v = f 2 ⎛⎜ ay ⎞⎟ and v = f ay .

⎝
Therefore the element of the time is given by :

f =

Consequently, the time to traverse PC is given by :

[Taking C as the origin, PM = x, and PM = y, then the equation of the circle is x2 = ay –

this, the time for the total descent through AC is equal to AMCf a . Therefore the time in
which the part AP is completed is fa ( AM + PM ) . Q. E. I.
Corollary 1.
287. Therefore, on denoting the ratio of the diameter of the circle to the circumference by
1 : π then AMC = 12 aπ , then the time of descent through AC = πa2 f a . From which it is
understood that the times of descent to C of most falling bodies are in the ratio of the
distances raised to the 3/2 power [i. e. those under an inverse square law, which obey
Kepler's Third Law]. [p. 116]
Corollary 2.
288. And thus bodies fall in times to different centres of force of this kind, which are in
the ratio composed from the product of the three on two power of the distances and
inversely as the square root of the effectiveness. For the effectiveness varies directly as
the square of the distance f.
[Recall that the effectiveness for gravitational forces is the size of the central attracting
mass, such as the sun, etc.]

Corollary 4.
294. Therefore with the successive positive values 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. put in place for m, the
following values of the series constitute a progression 1, 32 , 32..54 , 32..54..76 etc., in which it is
conceded that circle quadrature can be shown from the intermediate term. For if m = 12 ,
the corresponding terminus [i. e. limit] is found to be π2 , with 1 : π denoting the ratio of
the diameter to the circumference, if m = 32 , the corresponding terminus is 12 . π2 , and
thus again if m denotes 52 , 72 , 92 etc. . these terms arise : 12..34..π2 , 12..34..56..π2 , 12..34..56..78..π2 etc.
[Note initially that since m is no longer a positive integer, the series for the descent
time does not end, and the finite product for the finite sum becomes an infinite product
for an infinite sum. The Wallis infinite product was well known to Euler, and the relevant

the general terms cannot be given algebraically, in which Euler sets out his ideas, most
of which relate to the beta functions B(m, n), which can be viewed as generalised
binomial coefficients turned into functions either of real or complex variables; a
translation of this paper has been given by Stacy G. Langton, which is available from the
Euler Archive. Later we will evaluate Euler's integrals using the properties of Beta and
Gamma functions, which indicate that there may be a discrepancy by a factor of 1⁄2 in
Euler's values.

are evaluated from their associated Gamma functions, according to the definition :
B(m,n) =

Hence, B( 12 , 12 ) = Γ (1/ 2) = π . This does not agree with Euler's result, which is π/2.

(as there may be a mistake in the E019 paper). We will of course use Euler's values for
his integrals henceforth.]

proposition. For indeed this is a different case from these, since here in the expression for
the time not π but π occurs; and besides also only the whole time of descent can be
shown involving π , since the time for any indefinite interval can be shown except for
the quadrature of the whole transcendental curve

[p. 125] Also in a similar manner for the following times that I am about to define, unless
the times are wanted in seconds, these will be avoided as encumbrances. Indeed it is
easily seen that nothing else is to be found by expressing the time in seconds, unless the
use is forced upon us, in which case the expressions of time are divided by 250 and the

THEOREM.
308. If the centripetal force is as the power of the exponent of the distance n and many
bodies are released to fall from different distances, the times of the descents are
proportional to the powers of the distances, of which the exponent is 1−2n .
DEMONSTRATION.
Let AC = a be the distance of any body from the centre C and f the distance at which the
centripetal force is equal to the force of gravity [p. 126]. Then when it arrives at P, CP is
put equal to y and the height corresponding to the speed in this place is equal to v, then

Because this integral cannot be evaluated for all n, yet thus it may be compared, as the as
a and y have the same dimension 1−2n for the individual terms of a and y, since in the
differential they make a number of the same dimension, with dy as one dimension. As if
after integration, y is put equal to a, in which case the time for the whole descent arises,
1− n
only a will have just the same dimensions, obviously 1−2n , or it will be a multiple of a 2 .
Whereby, since another factor is not included apart from f , the numbers thus retain the
1− n
same value, however a is varied, and the different times of descent will be as a 2 , i. e.
as the powers of the distances, the exponent of which is 1−2n . Q. E. D. [A power series

Corollary 1.
309. Therefore when all the times of descent are equal to each other, it is necessary that
1− n
a 2 be a constant quantity, whatever a may be changed into, and since that happens if n
= 1, or the centripetal force is directly proportional to the distance, as we have seen (283).

Corollary 2.
310. In a similar manner it is at once apparent from these, that if the centripetal force
varies inversely as the square of the distance or n = – 2, the times of descent to this
centre are to each other as the distance raised to the power 32 , or in the three on two ratio
of the distances (287).
Corollary 3.
311. If there were many similar attractive centres of force, but with different strengths [or
measures of effectiveness], and to these bodies are released from equal distances, then the
n
times will be between themselves as f 2 , since a is considered as a constant, and f
indeed is the variable. Truly the strength is as the centripetal force at a given distance, for
example 1, therefore fn will vary inversely with the strength, and these times are in the
inverse square root ratio with the ratio of the strengths of the centres of force (285).
Corollary 4.
312. And if to the different centres of force of this kind bodies are released from any
distances, the times of descent of these are in a ratio composed from the direct 1−2n power
of the distance, and inversely as the square root of the effectiveness [or strength of the
attracting source].
Scholium.
313. From these propositions, which have been discussed above concerning centripetal
forces, it has been made abundantly clear how the motion of bodies should be found, if
the centrifugal force is substituted in place of the centripetal force, or a force repelling the
body from the centre.
[It is important to note that Euler's usage of the term 'centrifugal force' is different from
what is now understood: in Euler's day it was a true repulsive force, while in modern
times it has come to mean an apparent or fictitious force.]
Indeed everything remains as in the preceding discussions, except that in place of the
formula expressing the centripetal force, which was

this must be used. Yet neither do I judge it superfluous to report on certain other cases;
for these are known from the general rules pertaining to forces for general motion, which
cannot be deduced from a single calculation. Moreover these rules pertain to the action of
forces on a body at rest, to which our calculation, clearly when the increment of the speed
with respect to the first is infinitely small, is not so well adapted, with the thing itself
reduced to absurdity, unless the first element of the distance is traversed in an infinitely
short element of time. Moreover I make use of this axiom in order to elucidate the matter,
that a body placed anywhere will always be repelled from the centre of force, even if the
centrifugal force for that point is indefinitely small or zero ; and because that happens,
when the power of the distances to which the centrifugal force is in proportion is a
number greater than zero or positive.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

of the nth power of the distances along the line CP; it is required to find the speed of this
body at any point P and the time in which the interval CP is traversed.
SOLUTION.
If f is the distance at which the centrifugal force is equal to the force
of gravity, and CP is called y, to which the corresponding height of the
speed at P is v. [p. 129] Therefore the force, by which the body at P is
pressed upon, is equal to

and therefore dv =

(213), since the
body is driven forwards with an accelerated motion. Whereby, since
the body is given zero speed at C, then v =
y n+1
, if n + 1 is a
( n +1) f n
positive number; but if it is negative, then v becomes infinite. From
this the time is produced, in which the distance CP is traversed,

dy : y 2 = 1−2n (n + 1) f n y1− n ,
if indeed y1-n is 0 with y = 0. For if it were infinite, the time too would become infinite on
account of adding on a constant of infinite magnitude ; from that it may be deduced that
the body never leaves C. Therefore the time will be equal to

2
1− n
(n + 1) f n y1− n ,
as often as both the amounts 1 – n and n + 1 are taken as positive numbers. Q. E. I.
Corollary 1.
315. Indeed both these numbers 1 – n and n + 1 are positive, if n is contained between the
limits – 1 et + 1. And if n has crossed that limit – 1, the speed everywhere shall be
infinite ; and thus if + 1 is crossed, the time will be infinite.
Corollary 2.
316. Moreover it is agreed from the nature of things, that if n is a positive number, then
the body would never be leaving C (313) [Thus, on physical grounds, the initial force
must be zero at C, otherwise the body has a finite speed at this point, in contradiction
with the formula for the speed, which is zero at C]. On this account it is necessary that the
calculation fails, although n is contained between 0 and + 1, and in this calculation used it
is clear that a finite time is considered to have passed, [whereas only an elemental time is
allowed]. [p. 130]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Corollary 3.
317. These times moreover follow from the speeds, and hence from these the speed must
be considered absurd, whenever n is understood to be between 0 and + 1. Neither indeed
are these speeds possible to be generated, since the body never leaves C.
Scholion 1.
318. Let the curve AM (Fig. 30) be such, that with AP denoting y
and the applied abscissa PM is equal to v. This curve, with n
contained between the limits 0 and + 1, has this property, as it
merges with the axis from A and in this place the curvature has
an infinite magnitude, truly the vanishing radius of curvature.
Corollary 4.
319. Therefore as it often happens, the scale of the speeds or
rather of the heights of release corresponding to the speeds have a form of this kind, just
as often as it is judged to have been generated by a zero force, even if a calculation shows
otherwise, for it can be no more than a case within the imagination and in the nature of
things to be non-existent.
Scholium 2.
320. The reason for this aberration of the calculation from nature
in the beginning of the motion has without doubt been established,
and this other universal law in place concerning the increment of
the speed produced from the forces is wrongly used. [p. 131]
Since indeed, as now we have noticed (313), this law is only put
in place when the body has a finite speed, and this is always
rashly used at the beginning of the motion. Moreover since that
error only belongs to the first element, and generally is infinitely
small and on this account is not required to be considered. Truly it
is infinitely small, just as the first element of distance is traversed in an infinitely small
length of time, then indeed neither the increment in the speed nor the increment in the
time will be able to produce an examinable distinction. This happens, if the force, which
the body in the beginning of its motion is acted upon, is either of finite or even infinite
magnitude ; indeed this is evident in the case of the first element of time for the point to
pass through. But if the force, as in our case has come about in use, in the beginning is
infinitely small or rather zero, so much for the first element being completed in a finite
manner, for rather it is necessary for the an infinite time, since the body is at rest with no
force pushing and it will never leave its place. In certain of the remaining cases, for
which n is not only greater than zero, but also greater than one, the error is so great, that
even the calculation of the first element shows an infinite time. Truly, if n is understood
to lie between 0 and 1, the flaw in the calculation is noticed; and the use is seen for this
idea, since in these cases the scales of the forces has the form of the curve AM (Fig. 31),
which meets with the axis AP at A at right angles. Indeed suddenly in the proximity of the
point A with the line ab expressing an infinitely greater force than the length of the sagitta

the body runs through from the action of the force, which in the beginning it does, or that,
by which it is acted on up to the boundary. [p.132] Moreover in this case it being
apparent that the error has an opportunity to arise, if the body is considered to be acted

321. If the centripetal force is proportional to some function of the distance from the
centre C (Fig. 32), and the body is dropped towards C from A, the speed of the body is to
be found at any point P and the time in which the interval AP is traversed.
SOLUTION.
The curve BMD represents the scale of the forces
or the law of the centripetal force, thus in order
that the body at P is drawn towards C by the
force PM, which is in the ratio to the force of
gravity thus as this line PM is to the line of
constant length AE, by which the force of gravity
is expressed. Now let AP = x, PM = p, AE = 1 and
the height corresponding to the speed at P is equal
to v. The accelerating force is p, and therefore,
with the element Pp = dx, it follows that
dv = pdx (213). From which by
integration v = pdx is produced. But pdx

Corollary 1.
322. From these it is evident that if the body with the speed that it acquired at C, moves
back up again, then the ascending motion of the body is similar to that of the descent and
it has the same speed at the point P [p. 133] that it had before, and hence the time to
ascend through CP must be equal to the time falling through the same interval.
Corollary 2.
323. Here we have put the body at A to have no speed and to begin the motion from rest.
But the calculation is not more difficult to perform if the body is given some speed at A ;

324. Indeed we have assumed that p is a function of x itself, and therefore not with
respect to the centre of force C, by only of the initial motion A. Yet the solution is held in
place to no lesser degree if indeed p is a function of the distance CP from the centre of
force C, that we may call y, and y = a – x , with the whole interval put in place AC = a,
and because of this, p denotes a function of a – x, i. e. a function of x and of a constant,
as we have assumed. Truly our solution extends to more cases, for it determines the
motion of the body acted on by any force, not with respect to having any certain fixed
point, and provided these forces keep acting in the same direction everywhere. Indeed
unless this [latter] condition is made, the body will stop moving along a line and begin to
move on a curve, the motion of which we will set out in the following chapters. [p. 134]
Scholium 2.
325. Up to the present we have determined the rectilinear motions of a body under given
forces ; now indeed the other part of this chapter remains to be explored, from which it is
required to define the law governing the forces from the given condition of the motion.
This indeed shall be either from the speeds or times, and moreover each of the two ways
is to be investigated. Indeed this will be with regard to either a single descent or ascent, in
the individual points of which either the speeds or the times are given, in which certain
parts of the interval are traversed. Or an infinite number of descents to a fixed point from
different heights are to be made, in which either the final speeds or the individual times
taken to complete the whole interval are given. Therefore from these in the first place
four problems arise, the solutions of which it is necessary to display here. Besides these
other questions will be brought forward, in which neither the speeds alone nor the times
alone are given, but a certain other amount, that is composed from both, and indeed the
questions of this kind, since a great many can be devised, some more conspicuous, and
likewise from the solutions of these the remainder of the solutions can be understood that
we advance in the discussion.

x itself and of the constant is be put in place. Truly the force acting at P that we seek is
put equal to p, which hence can be found from the acceleration of the body dv, while it
runs through the element Pp = dx,. Since indeed dv = pdx (213),then p = dv

sought itself will be found relative to the force of gravity, as the increment of the height
corresponding to the speed is to the element of distance that the body has travelled
through meantime. Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.
327. If v = x or the distance described by the body itself is equal to the appropriate height
for the speed, becomes dv = dx and p = 1, which indicates that this force produces a
motion that is uniform and equal to gravity itself.

329. But it is agreed from above that it is not possible for this case to exist ; for since the
force at the start of the motion at A is zero, [p. 136] the body never leaves this point, but
remains at rest here for ever. The same can be pointed out for the time computed for the
distance AP , which is equal to dx

Corollary 3.
330. Therefore for this situation not to arise, it is necessary that dv
shall be a quantity of
dx
this kind, which does not vanish by making v = 0, but which shall be either a finite or
infinite quantity. From which it is evident that the scale of height with the corresponding
speeds AM (Fig. 30) in which by taking AP = x with the lines PM that represent these
heights v, must not coincide with the axis at A, for it is necessary that it is set at some
finite angle to that axis. [Thus, asymptotic tangents are not allowed.]
Scholium 2.
331. These are to be understood to apply only to these cases, in which the speed of the
body is put vanishing at A and with the scale AM meeting the axis at A. Otherwise the
following occurs, if the body at A now has a speed, by which, even if the force is zero,
yet it is able to progress under the action of the force, as thus it is not necessary for an
infinite time to be spent for the distance AP to be completed.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

332. With the time given, in which the body progressing on the straight line AC (Fig. 32)
passes through the particular interval AP, it is necessary to define the law of the force
which is effected, in order that the body is carried forwards by this motion. [p. 137]
SOLUTION.
With the given distance AP = x and with the time in which it is transversed equal to
t , since the square of the expression of the time has the single dimension t [for
convenience as the expression is eventually squared, the time T is written as T = t ], the
force sought is equal to p and the height corresponding to the speed at P = v; this indeed
is necessary in order that p can be found, although it must emerge from the calculation.

for which x = a. But in this case it has acted thus (289). Whereby from this it is seen to be
concluded that the body, when it arrives at C, never leaves from there, which can thus be
conceived possible. Because on approach, since

the first condition of approaching from above], as these are unable to be reconciled.

337. If the body thus falls along the line AP (Fig. 33), so that it has the speed at P in the

PM of the adjoining given curve AM with this uniform speed; it is necessary to determine
the law of the force acting, by which such motion is generated.

By putting AP = x and PM = s will be a function of x
on account of the given curve AM. Again let the force
acting on the body at P be equal to p, with the height

342. If n is made smaller than one, then the speed at the point A is made infinitely large,

Corollary 6.
343. If n is greater than one, and yet less than two, then the speed is certainly zero at A,
but the force remains infinitely great at A, and it decreases in the ratio of a certain
multiple of the distance traversed.

344. If n = 2, we have the case of the uniform force. Indeed it happens that p = 42

shown the body under the hypothesis of this uniform force acquiring a certain speed
descending from rest through some distance, for which in the same time, falling with the
same final speed, it would travel through twice the distance.
Corollary 8.
345. Truly if n should be greater than 2, those cases are produced, that we have discussed
(319) that it is not possible to obtain in physical circumstances, even though the
calculation shows otherwise. For it happens that the speed at A is zero, and the force in
that place vanishes, on account of the body being unable to leave A, not according to the
opposing calculation, which shows a finite time T for the body to traverse any finite
distance AP.

centre of force C (Fig. 34), to define the law of the centripetal force producing the
descents of this kind, with the position in which the body begins its individual descents
taken from rest.
SOLUTION.
Let CM represent the altitude scale [i. e. graph; Euler
uses the word scala, which means 'ladder', or 'steps'.] for
the heights corresponding to the speeds which the body
acquires at the point C, so that PM is thus the height
corresponding to the speed that the body gains on starting
its descent from P towards C. Truly the curve DN is the
scale of the forces sought, of which it is agreed that the
applied lines PN show the centripetal force acting on the
body at the point P; and indeed the line CB marks the
centripetal force equal to the force of gravity. With these
in place, and with the body falling from P to C, the
height corresponding to the speed at C is equal to the applied area CDNP to the line BC

given in terms of y, it follows that p = dy
[Thus, if we want a modern equivalent to Euler's derivation, we can consider the area
CDNP to be the work done by the centripetal force on unit mass over the distance CP,
which is equivalent to the work done on unit mass in the uniform gravitational field case
over the distance PM.]
Corollary 1.
348. Let the speeds acquired at C be as the distances traversed : v is as y consequently p
is as y. Therefore the centripetal force is proportional to the distance from the centre C.
Corollary 2.
349. If the speeds acquired at C are made proportional to the exponent n of the distances
from the centre C, then v will be as y 2n , and hence p is as y 2n −1 . Therefore the
centripetal force is in proportion to the distances raised to the power 2n – 1.

350. Since the speed acquired at C, since y = 0, should also be equal to zero and besides
for the greater distance y the larger the corresponding speed should be, then n is signified

former case the centripetal force at C will hence be infinitely great and decreases with
increasing distances ; indeed in the other case when the force is zero at C, it increases
with increasing distances. [p. 144]
Corollary 5.
352. Since
PM = CDNP
, it is evident that the curve CM is also the scale of the heights
CB
for the corresponding speeds, when the body moves away from C along the straight line
CP, with the centripetal force changed into a centrifugal force, and the motion beginning
from rest at C. (321)

353. Moreover though in this manner a problem can be reduced to Proposition 42 (326),
by changing the centripetal force into a centrifugal force, yet the ascent time through CP
in the case of the centrifugal force will not be equal to the time of descent through PC in
case of the centripetal force. Nor indeed are the speeds equal, which are generated in each
case by equal distances being generated, that leads to equal times, but that is also
apparent to be the opposite upon consideration. For just as the centripetal force at C is
zero, the centrifugal force also disappears [in Prop. 45] ; on account of which the ascent
time along CP is infinite (314), while the descent time is still completed in a finite time.
Therefore there is no basis from that likeness of the speed for supplying the needs to
solve the following problems. Moreover in the following propositions the times are to be
given, in which the individual descents are completed, and that not only is the most
difficult for the solution, for from the scale of the times no certain scale of the forces can
be established. On which account we will include only special cases for this proposition,
the solution of which is not prevented by our forces. [p. 145]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

PROPOSITION 46.
PROBLEM.
354. If the times, in which the body (Fig. 35) reaches the centre of force C from any
distances PC, are in the ratio of some multiple of the distances, then the law of the
centripetal force can be defined.
SOLUTION.
These times are as the powers of the distances of the
exponent n, and the curve DN is the scale of the
centripetal force sought, thus as the line πv applied sets
out the force by which the body present at π is acted upon
towards C, with CB representing the force of gravity.
With these in place the body descends from some point
P, and the distance PC is put equal to a, and hence the
descent time through PC is as an, on account of which we
put that equal to Can, with C denoting some constant
quantity, which does not contain a , since a on account of
the variable point P is indeed itself a variable quantity.
Now the body arrives at some place π for
which Cπ is called x , the height of that place corresponding to the speed is equal to
π = CPND −CπvD (321) [Thus, the linear case gΔv in modern terms is equal to
[v =] PNv
BC
BC
∫
the non-linear case ady , where a is the non-linear acceleration]. Moreover the area
CPND is put equal to A and the area CπvD = X and BC = 1; therefore the height
corresponding to the speed at π is equal to A – X and the speed itself is equal to
( A − X ) . Here it is to be noted moreover that X is some function of x and of the
constant, in which a is not present; indeed the area CπvD does not depend on the point P,
but keeps the same value, wherever the point P is taken, since the distance Cπ remains
the same. But the quantity X is such a function of x, just as A is a function of a; indeed by
changing x into a the function X is changed in A. [p. 146] Now the time, in which this
dx
, as the integral thus
descent of the distance Cπ travelled through, is equal to
∫ ( A− X )
must be taken so that with x made equal to 0, the integral should itself vanish. Therefore
from this expression the total time can be found for the descent along PC, if x is put in
place equal to a, in which case X too is changed into A. Moreover, since this resulting
quantity thus must be able to be compared, as in that a may have the dimension n. On
account of which also the formula of the differential dx
has dimensions n, (for the
( A− X )
n
integral is required to be equal to Ca ), and it is likewise necessary in the indefinite
dx
that a and x have dimensions n everywhere. On account of which also
integral

page 165
dx
has dimensions n, and it is established that as a
the formula of the differential
( A− X )
and x are to have a single dimension as also dx. Therefore it is evident that a and x
should have the dimensions 1 − n in A − X , and 2 − 2n in A − X . But since a is not
present in X, X must be a function of dimension 2 − 2n of x only; therefore X cannot be
any other function than bx 2− 2n , and therefore A = ba 2 − 2n . Indeed a constant amount can
be added to bx 2− 2n , when that, since to ba 2− 2n has to be added equally, may again
exceed that from A − X . For if we put X = bx 2 − 2n + bc 2− 2n and hence
A − X = b(a 2 − 2n − x 2− 2n ) . But since X denotes the area CπvD, it should vanish when x
= 0, on account of which, if 2 − 2n is a positive number, it must always be the case that
bc 2 − 2n = 0 ; but if 2 − 2n is a positive number, the quantity bc 2− 2n will be assigned to a
negative infinite quantity [in the integral, which cannot happen]. Therefore whatever is
shall be, bc 2 − 2n must be b02− 2n ; indeed with this, if 2 − 2n or 1 − n is a positive number
[p. 147], it freely vanishes, and if 1 − n is negative, it presents an infinitely large number.
But when the proposition shall be to find the law of the centripetal force, nothing is
returned, as this constant quantity is either zero or an infinitely large number. And with
the centripetal force at π = p = πv, the area X = CπvD= pdx . On account of which we
∫
have bx 2 − 2n + bc 2 − 2n =
∫ pdx , and with the differentials taken, there is produced
p = (2 − 2n)bx1− 2n . Consequently, the centripetal force must be in the ratio of the
( 1 − 2n ) power of the distances. Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.
355. Therefore, when all the descents to the centre C are to be isochronous or completed
in equal times, n should be put equal to zero, with which put into effect it comes about
that the centripetal force is directly proportional to the distance. Indeed now we turn our
attention to the case when all the descents to the centre are isochronous. (283).
Corollary 2.
356. If we put n = 1, as the times of descent are in proportion to the distances traversed,
with 2 – 2n vanishing, the centripetal force also disappears. [Correction made by Paul
Stackel, the editor of this volume of the Opera Omnia.]
Corollary 3.
357. If n = 12 , or the times are in the inverse square root ratio of the distances, the
centripetal force is constant, as besides we have elicited that property above (218). If
therefore n > 12 , the centripetal force decreases with increasing distance, but if n < 12 , it
increases with increasing distance. [p. 148]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

358. Indeed these properties all follow from Proposition 39 (308), where we have shown,
that if the centripetal force is set out as the nth power of the distances, the times of descent
are in the ratio of the 1−2n power of the distances. Which proposition is in close agreement
with our other arguments; for with n put in place of 1−2n there is produced 1 – 2n in
place of n. Yet it has never been considered by me to have an influence on this
proposition, for here from the first, by the analytical method from the given condition of
the times, the law of the centripetal force has been elicited, where I might have been led
to the same in the reverse order. Neither in addition was it certain before that these other
laws found for centripetal forces were not satisfactory. Truly the incredible solution in the
latter excels in usefulness. For since it is purely analytical and it is my own personal
development, as no one until now has embraced the use of the method, and which enables
the solutions to be deduced for many other problems, which by other methods are
attempted in vain. Thus since a method of this kind has been hitherto unknown, neither
isochronous descents nor tautochronous curves have been found before in this way, but
rather have been found by examining either the centripetal force proportion with distance,
or the cycloid curve, from which these the properties have arisen unexpectedly for
Geometers.
[Thus in his own quiet modest way, Euler sets out his claims for the new analytical tools
he has developed : this particular chapter of this book marks a sort of watershed in Euler's
works : for the older semi-geometrical methods are to be laid to rest for ever and to give
way to this modern vibrant analytical tool, that has grown in stature from his earlier
papers. One has to remember that these thoughts by Euler were set in print in 1733 a few
years after the death of Newton, and that some 18 years previously Taylor had produced
his Calculus based on Newton's methods and notation : the latter was doomed to oblivion
despite its brilliance due mainly to its obscure notation, and Euler's methods are still with
us. It is even more remarkable, perhaps, that only 100 years before, Briggs was perfecting
logarithms with no symbols in sight, and Harriot's book essentially on Vieta's forward
looking algebra involving the first use of symbol methods, had just been published.]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

PROBLEM.
359. From the given scales of the forces BND (Fig. 36), by which the body is acted upon
falling through the distance AC, to find innumerable others such as βνδ , by which the
body acted on by a force at C always acquires the same speed, with the body always
starting from rest at A. [p. 149]
SOLUTION.
Since for the graph [scala] of the forces BND, the
height corresponding to the speed that the body has at C,
is equal to ABCD
(321), with CE set out as the force of
CE
gravity, and for that scale βνδ with the height equal to
AβδC
(cit.), the area ABDC should be equal to AβδC ,
CE
certainly a property that an infinite number of curves can
have. Indeed with the point P anywhere in the interval
AC, the point cannot have this equal area property, as it
must have the areas ABNP = Aβν P , unless the curve
βνδ falls on the other curve BND. Therefore there will be a certain difference between
these areas, that we may call Z, thus, in order that Aβν P = ABNP − Z , which difference
Z thus ought to be compared, in order that it vanishes with the point P incident on A as on
C. On this account some other curve AMC is constructed on the axis AC, which crosses
the axis at the points A and C, and the applied line PM can be use in place of this Z;
indeed it will vanish with the point P transferred to either A or C. Moreover when from
the same curve AMC innumerable curves βνδ can be deduced, it is expedient to use
some function of the applied line PM in place of Z as itself. Truly this function must have
this property, that it becomes equal to zero, if PM has disappeared. Now with these thus
in place, put AC = a , AP = x , PN = y , Pν = Y and PM = z , of which quantities a, x,
y, and z, as well as Z, a function of z, are be considered to be given, then truly the
unknown quantity will be Y, [p. 150] which is defined from this equation
Ydx = ydx − Z . Indeed by taking the differentials, the equation

the curve AMC, drawn to the normal MR at the point M. If thus Nν is taken, which is the
line equal to y − Y , equal to some multiple of the subnormal PR, βνδ will satisfy the
curve sought.
Corollary 2.
361. We can also put dZ = pzdz , with p denoting some function of z. Here indeed we
have no need to consider that above, since Z can always be taken to vanish, as it becomes
zero with z put equal to zero. For any function taken in place of p, the integral itself pzdz
always thus can be taken, as it becomes zero with the position z = 0. On account of this
pzdz
we have this equation : Y = y − dx = y − p .PR or Nν = p .PR , which construction
appears to have the widest use.

362. Here it is to be noted that it is not necessary that the regular curves BND and AMC
are adhered to, which are retained by reliable equations. For the curves βνδ to be
constructed, also it is sufficient for especially irregular curves to be accepted with no
equation satisfied. Equally indeed the construction for determining the subnormals is
successful.[p. 151]

363. From the given scales of the forces BND (Fig. 36) , by which a body acted upon
traverses the interval AC, to find innumerable other curves such as βνδ , by which it is
effected, that the body completes the interval AC in the same time.
SOLUTION.
For any interval taken AP let the time, in which this is completed with the scale of the
forces acting BND, be equal to t and the time, in which the same interval is completed
with the scale acting βνδ is equal T, and put T = t + Z , which quantity Z vanishes with
the point P transferred to A or C. On this account as before, with this Z made a function
of the applied line PM, with the curve AMC crossing the axis AC at A and C, such that it
vanishes by making PM = z = 0 ; now we call AP x, PN y and Pv Y, and the time
∫ ∫dxydx and T = ∫ ∫dxYdx , wherefore we have this equation :
∫ ∫dxYdx = ∫ ∫dxydx + Z , from which Y can be determined. For on differentiating, we have

366. These two final propositions are almost alike and thus are connected to each other, since also they require to be solved in a special way, the usefulness of which is apparent when the method is used again in the following chapter. Moreover indeed these propositions are not inelegant and bring to a conclusion all the cases to be explained regarding rectilinear motion produced by the forces which we have set in place, and which by necessity had to be inserted. Nor indeed has it seemed suitable to adapt these to specific cases, on account of the exceedingly extended calculations that would have arisen. Therefore from these we move on to consider rectilinear motion of a medium with resistance.
