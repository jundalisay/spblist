PROPOSITION 35. PROBLEM.

286. If the centripetal force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from
the centre C (Fig.28) and the body falls from A as far as C, the time is to be found in
which the body traverses any portion of this distance AC.
SOLUTION.
By keeping AC = a and the distance, in which the centripetal force of gravity is equal
to f, and CP = y and the speed at P corresponds to the height v. Therefore, on account of
n = – 2 , by Prop. 32 (264),
a− y
a− y
v = f 2 ⎛⎜ ay ⎞⎟ and v = f ay .

Therefore the element of the time is given by :

f =

Consequently, the time to traverse PC is given by :

[Taking C as the origin, PM = x, and PM = y, then the equation of the circle is x2 = ay –

ydy = − 1 d (ay − y 2 ) + 1 ady , etc. Finally, the arc length

Whereby the time for to travel the distance is given by : CP =a
(CM − PM ) , and from
f
this, the time for the total descent through AC is equal to AMCf a . Therefore the time in
which the part AP is completed is fa ( AM + PM ) . Q. E. I.
Corollary 1.
287. Therefore, on denoting the ratio of the diameter of the circle to the circumference by
1 : π then AMC = 12 aπ , then the time of descent through AC = πa2 f a . From which it is
understood that the times of descent to C of most falling bodies are in the ratio of the
distances raised to the 3/2 power [i. e. those under an inverse square law, which obey
Kepler's Third Law]. [p. 116]
Corollary 2.
288. And thus bodies fall in times to different centres of force of this kind, which are in
the ratio composed from the product of the three on two power of the distances and
inversely as the square root of the effectiveness. For the effectiveness varies directly as
the square of the distance f.
[Recall that the effectiveness for gravitational forces is the size of the central attracting
mass, such as the sun, etc.]

289. If the centripetal force varies inversely as the cube of the distance, then n = - 3 and
f 3 ⎛ a2 − y2 ⎞

v = 2 ⎜ 2 2 ⎟ . Therefore v = ay

Moreover, in the quadrant of the circle, PM = (a 2 − y 2 ) ; the time in which CP is
completed is therefore a 2 .( AC − PM ) , and the time in which the whole distance AC is
