THE MOTION OF A POINT ON A GIVEN LINE IN A VACUUM.
 
PROPOSITION 31. Problem.


282. With a uniform force present acting downwards, to find the curve AM (Fig. 36),
upon which a body with a given initial speed moves thus, so that in equal times equal
angles are completed about a fixed point C.
 
Solution.

The beginning of the curve is taken at a certain place A,
at which the line CA is normal to the curve itself, and let the
speed at A corresponding to the height b and let AC = a ;
the angular speed is as ab , [p. 126] to which quantity the
angular speed expressed at individual points M must be
equal. Let the speed at M correspond to the height v and CM
= x, then we have mn = dx. The ratio is made so that
[The component of the speed normal to the distance CM is
taken.] since the quantity divided by MC gives the angular
Mn . v
; which since this is equal to ab , we
speed equal to Mm

have this equation :
Now let the line DCQ be drawn vertical and the sine of the angle ACD = m, the cosine of
this is equal to
( 1 − m 2 ) with the whole sine put equal to 1. Likewise the sine of the
angle MCD is equal to t; and the cosine is equal to ( 1 − tt ) . Therefore with these in
place it follows that

thus the equation becomes
But since the body has fallen from the height DQ, then
v = b + g .DQ = b + ga ( 1 − m 2 ) − gx ( 1 − tt ) .
With which values substituted in the equation, this equation arises :
bdx 2 ( 1 − tt ) = a 2bdt 2 + ga3dt 2 ( 1 − m 2 ) − ga 2 xdt 2 ( 1 − tt ) − bx 2dt 2
or
Which equation thus by integration, as t = m makes x = a, expresses the nature of the
curve sought. Q.E.I.
Corollary1.
283. If in place of the sines of the angles ACD and MCD the cosine of these are
introduced, these become
( 1 − m 2 ) = n and ( 1 − tt ) = q , then we have
or [p. 127]
which thus has to be integrated, so that on putting q = n , we have x = a.
Corollary 2.
284. Where the curve is normal to the radius CM , with dx vanishing there, it becomes :
b( a 2 − x 2 ) = ga 2 ( qx − na ).
Hence, whenever
the curve is normal to the radius CM . Moreover since q is contained between the limits
+ 1 and – 1, x cannot be a greater than the quantity given ; for with x =∝ , q =∝ , which is
absurd.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Corollary 3.
285. If CM is normal to the curve, then the angular speed is equal to
which must be equal to
b
. Therefore that is the maximum angular speed if q = – 1.
a
Moreover that angular speed is made less than that, when x is made greater. Now again
the angular speed is less than that, when the angle of the curve to the radius MC is
greater. Whereby the curve cannot descend below a certain distance C, as the distance
giving x is found from this equation :
clearly,
Therefore this is the maximum distance of the curve from the point C.
Corollary 4.
286. Therefore since the curve is not able to be at a greater distance from the fixed point
C, [p. 127] this curve returns on itself. Clearly either after one revolution or after two or
three etc., or even after an infinite number of revolutions it will return [to its starting
conditions], as the letters a, b, n and g assumed.
Example.
287. If the force acting vanishes, then g = 0 and the body advances uniformly. Therefore
this equation is then obtained to describe the curve :
the integral by logarithms is :

Which on reduction gives :
The line AC falls on the vertical CD; indeed likewise on account of the force g
vanishing, this must become x = a with t = 0, from which there arises a 2 + c 2 = 0 andEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Which is the equation of a circle of diameter a passing through the fixed point C. For
when the motion is uniform on a circle, the motion is also uniform with respect to any
point on the circumference.
Scholium.
288. Moreover it is evident in this case that the circumference of the circle is a
satisfactory curve, the centre of which is at the fixed point C, which solution is Cleary the
easiest and which can be produced spontaneously. On account of which it is a source of
wonder that this case is not contained in the solution. [p. 129] Now the reason for this is
clearly similar to that, as we deduced above (268), where we observed a similar paradox.
Having designated C as the centre of the circle, it is necessary to set x = a or dx = 0,
which now, since x is considered as a variable quantity, is unable to be done, especially
since in the same equation the solution is otherwise contained, in which x really is a
variable quantity. Now from the first equation on putting v = b, which is Mn.a = Mm.x , it
is understood that the circle can be a satisfactory solution ; for if x = a everywhere, then
also Mn = Mm. Moreover I consider the great help to be given, in producing the
construction of the curves satisfying this problem, if a solution could be found by such a
method, which at the same time should give the case of uniform circular motion about a
centre C. For as the most simple case to be present in the solution has thus been
removed, as it cannot be found, we conclude that it is often the case with other curves
that simple curves are contained in the solution of some general curves, which are hard to
solve.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Problem.
282. If the body is attracted by some force to the centre of force C (Fig. 37), to find the
curve AM on which the body is carried with a speed equal to the uniform motion towards
C.
Solution. [p. 130]
Let the minimum speed of the body at A correspond to
the height b, the line CA is a tangent to the curve at A,
since the body at A ought to move directly to C. Let AC =
a and CM = x, the speed at M corresponds to the height v
and the centripetal force at M is equal to P; then we have
v = b − Pdx , as the integral has to be taken in order that
∫
with x = a it vanishes and makes v = b. Now the speed at
M has to be of such a magnitude, since the element Mm is
completed in the same increment of time as the element
Pp with the speed b . Hence it becomes
b : v = Pp : Mm = MT : MC , hence this equation is
produced [for the triangles Mnm and MTC are similar] :
The perpendicular CT to the tangent is equal to p; it
becomes

With this substituted we have the following equation for the curve AM :

Corollary 2.
291. If
∫ ( 1dt−tt ) is thus taken, so that it becomes equal to zero if t = 0, there is produced
by integration from that equation:
if with the centre C and with the radius BC = 1, the arc of the circle BSs is described.
From which it is apparent that the curve AM has an infinite number of rotations before it
arrives at C. For with x = 0, BS is made ∝ .
Corollary 3.
292. Therefore the construction of this curve depends in part on the quadrature of the
circle and in part on logarithms, if n + 1 is a positive number. But if n + 1 is a negative
number, that term which was given by a logarithm, is also reduced to the quadrature of
the circle.
Corollary 4.
293. This curve has a turning point [flexus contrarii]where dp = 0. [p. 132] Therefore in
order that this point can be found, the equation is taken ;
from which by differentiation, and on putting dp = 0, there is produced :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Thus, this equation arises:
Which on substitution into the integration gives the angle ACM at which the turning point
lies.
Scholium 1.
295. But since from the nature of these kinds of curves it is difficult to produce turning
points in general, it is considered that the principles are best effected by descending to the
level of special cases.
Example 1.
296. If the centripetal force is proportional to the distances or P = xf , in making n = 1.
Therefore with the arc BS put equal to s, the curve sought is expressed by this equation :
[p. 133] From which equation with any distance of the point M from C the angle BCS is
found, at which the body is without doubt present at that distance. Now between the
distance MC = x and the perpendicular CT = p, there is this equation :

Therefore the cosine of the angle that the curve makes at the turning point with the radius
CM is equal to [Euler's original formula has here been corrected by P. S. in the O. O. to

Now the equation of the curve converted into a series on putting

Therefore in this series, the beginning of the curve, where x is not much less than a, or y
is extremely small, will be
Then from this equation it is apparent on making x = 0 that s becomes ∝ , whereby the
curve goes round the centre C in an infinite number of spirals, and when the body is near
to the centre , the equation becomes :

From which it follows if x vanishes that xx = 1 or the curve finally also goes in an
infinitely small circle.
If ab = ff, then
The turning point in this case lies at that place where 2ax = 3 xx , where either x = 0 or
x = 23a . But if it is not the case that ab = 4ff, then

centripetal force is proportional to some power of the distance, or P = x n , and the

Here two cases are to be distinguished, the one in which n + 1 is a positive number, and
the other in which it is negative.
If n + 1 is a positive number, on making x = 0 the equation becomes
Hence in this case the curve AM goes around the centre C in a logarithmic spiral.
pp
But if n + 1 is a negative number, on making x = 0 the equation becomes xx = 1 .
Therefore in these cases the curve at C becomes an infinitely small circle. The speed of
approaching C in these cases becomes infinitely large, and on account of this, unless the
curve becomes a circle [p. 136] the body approaches C with an infinite speed, which is
contrary to the condition of the problem. Therefore with the curves determined, upon
which the body uniformly approaches the centre of forces, we will investigate these
curves in which the body is carries around the centre of force with a uniform motion.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

300. If a body is always attracted to the centre of force C (Fig. 38), to determine the
curve AM, upon which the body is moving with a uniform angular motion around the
centre C.
Solution.
Let A be the highest point of the curve, where
the curve is normal to the radius AC, and let the
speed of the body at A correspond to b and AC = a;
the angular speed at A = ab , to which quantity the
angular speed at some particular point M must be
equal. Putting CM = x, to which CP is taken equal,
and the centripetal force at M is equal to P; then the
speed at M corresponds to the height b − Pdx ,

with the integration of Pdx thus taken, so that it
vanishes on putting x = a. With the tangent MT
drawn, the perpendicular sent from C to that is
called CT = p; then we have x : p = Mm : mn. [p.
137; again, the infinitesimal triangle Mnm and the
finite triangle MTC are similar] On account of this,
the speed passing along mn is equal to

303. Indeed it is evident through these that for whatever hypothesis of centripetal force, it
is satisfactory for a circle with centre C to be described [p. 138] ; for the body must be
moving uniformly on a given circle. Moreover even if the general equation does not seem
to include the circle, yet no less it must be contained, as we have now intimated above.
[Part of Euler's problem was the imperfect state of affairs at the time regarding
dynamics : we would now make some reference to angular momentum, which he was
later to clarify, in the analysis. This of course makes these special curves all the more
fascinating for us to look back on; thus, Euler's use of a potential energy or a work related
function was introduced as a means of simplifying problems – only to be discovered later
that this was how the world really worked, although Euler understood that he had to base
his dynamics on known physical facts, such as Huygens' pendulum as a means of finding
the acceleration of gravity, and Galileo's inclined plane : it was the latter that gave rise toEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

304. Moreover it is evident that no other curve going around the centre except the circle
is able to satisfy the condition sought. For in curves of this kind it is not possible that all
the lines drawn from the centre and normal to the curve are equal to each other. Therefore
which curves besides the circle which solve the problem, these must pass through the
centre C itself, so that not more than one radius MC is normal to the curve. These curves
are of this kind that we look at in the following example.
Example.

306. Let the uniform force acting be g pulling downwards everywhere and the given
curve AT (Fig. 39) [p. 140] ; to find the curve AM, upon which a body thus descends, so
that the time to pass through any arc AM is proportional to the square root of the
corresponding applied line PT of the given curve AT.
Solution.
The common abscissa AP = x, the applied line of the
curve AT is PT = t; hence the equation between x and t
is given, since the curve AT is given, which must be
such that with x = 0 makes t = 0 also, since the initial
motion is put at A and the times reckoned from the point
A. Again let the curve sought be AM with the applied
line PM = y and the arc AM = s. Let the initial speed at
A correspond to the height b. Hence the speed at M
corresponds to the height b + gx and the time in which
the arc is completed is equal to
which must be equal to t . Hence this equation is obtained :
Hence

From which equation, since t is given through x, the curve sought AM can be constructed.
Moreover this has to be constructed so that x = 0 also gives y = 0, as the start of the curve
AM is at A. Q.E.I.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Corollary 1.
307. Therefore in order that the curve is real, it is necessary that bdt 2 + gxdt 2 shall be
greater than 4tdx 2 , or [p. 141]
For if the relation becomes
then the curve AM becomes a vertical straight line, upon which the quickest descent is
made.
Corollary 2.
308. Therefore if the curve AT somewhere makes dt equal to
2 t
dx , then the tangent
b + gx
there corresponding to the curve AM is vertical. And if beyond this point it satisfies
dt < dx then the curve AM does not descent to that point, but has a turning point at

that point where the tangent is vertical.

309. If the angle that the curve AT makes to the vertical AP at A is acute, the tangent of
which is m, then at the beginning A :
hence m( b + gx ) must be greater than 4x, which always happens if b is not equal to 0.
Moreover it then becomes :

Therefore with x = 0 , dx =∝ , or in these cases the tangent to the curve AM at A is
horizontal, unless b = 0. But if b = 0, then it becomes
Therefore least the curve AM becomes imaginary, gm must be greater than 4 and then the
curve AM makes an acute angle with AP at A, the tangent of which is

Corollary 4. [p. 142]
310. Now if the angle that the curve AT makes with the vertical AP at A is right, then
m =∝ . Therefore in this case the tangent to the curve AM at A is always horizontal, then
either b is made equal to zero, or otherwise.
Corollary 5.
311. If the speed at A is equal to 0 and at the start A the curve AT is combined with the
curve, the equation of which is t = αx n with the number n taken as positive, so that as x
increases, so too does t, then we have :
Now least dy becomes imaginary on making x = 0, it must be true that n > 2n − 1 or
n < 1, in which case clearly the curve AT is normal to AP at A. For now at the point A,
n 2αgx n
and the radius of osculation of the curve AM at A is equal to 2( n −1 ) . From which it
follows for the curve AM, the tangent of which is horizontal at A, that the radius of
osculation at A must be infinitely small, if the body is able to start from rest on that curve.
For unless the radius of osculation is infinitely small, the body remains at rest at A for
ever.
Corollary 6. [p. 143]
312. Therefore if the body placed at A descends from rest, so that the curve AM is made
real, then dt must be greater than dx , even at the start of the curve AT. Whereby if we

Now it is to be noted that p cannot be such a quantity that
∫ pdx can be made infinitely
large when integrated in the prescribed manner.
Corollary 7.
313. From what has been said it is understood that as long as the value p is kept positive,
the body descends the curve AM ; if we male p = 0 and then negative, then the curve has
a cusp at that place and returns up again. If p =∝ with pdx yet remaining finite, then
∫
the curve AM has a horizontal tangent there.
Corollary 8.
314. If b is not put equal to 0, from the same curve AT innumerable curves AM can be
found; since the initial speed can indeed be taken as greater or less, with another curve
AM produced.

315. The greatest use of this problem is in the solutions of the following indeterminate
problems, in which all the curves are required, upon which a body in the same time
arrives at either a given straight or curved line. On account of this we will investigate the
innate character of the quantities t and p with more care, so that we are allowed to use
these in the following propositions.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

317. If on making x = a, p = 0, or if the curve AND at D stands perpendicular to the
horizontal CD, then the curve AMC also remains perpendicular to DC.

318. And if on putting x = 0 also p = 0, the tangent to the curve AMC is vertical at A ;
now likewise also it comes about if p x becomes equal to zero on putting x = 0. But if

an infinite number of ways an infinite number of curves AMC can be found. On account

from which it is apparent that all the curves AMC hence arising are tangents to the line
AB at A. Now the equation for the curves AMC is this [from (312)] :

then we have
Now
Thus the total area under the curve AMC is equal to :
Corollary 4.
322. Therefore among these curves AMC the longest is produced if f = 0; for then
AMC = a + 54 gab. And for this, that equation becomes :
Now the shortest is obtained by making f =∝ ; for then it becomes AMC = a + 23 gab.
And the equation for this curve is :

323. All the curves AND contained under the equation
are parabolas, thus so that by parabolas alone innumerable curves are found satisfying the
problem. Now neither are all the parabolas contained by this equation, as in place of this
equation, if this other equation is used :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

which also contains an infinite number of parabolas, again an infinite number of curves
AMC are found, upon which a body completes the descent in the given time. From which
it is to be understood that if only conic sections are substituted in place of the curve AND,
then such an infinite number of curves AMC can be found. [p. 148] For taking this
equation for the curve AND : z 2 + αz = β x 2 + γx + δxz , which contains all the conic
sections passing through the point A, then it must become [for BD]:
b + α b = βa 2 + γa + δa b
γ
and both α and
β a + γ +δ b
must be positive quantities; which is easily seen, since it can
α + 2 b −δa
be done in an infinite number of ways. If then all the algebraic curves are considered and
afterwards also the transcendental curves likewise, the greatest wealth of all the curves
described in the same way con be conceived.

Whereby the curve becomes an inclined straight line, upon which the descent is in a time
2 ga
equal to g + b . Therefore it is evident the shorter lines [i.e. curves] are given by this
inclined straight line, upon which a body from A arrives at the horizontal BC in a given
time; indeed on making n < 12 the line AMC becomes shorter.

326. Otherwise if a single curve AND is given, and it is required to provide a curve AMC,
from that curve itself innumerable others can be found. For with one equation given
between z and x taking
hence with diverse values of m, innumerable curves are found. In a similar manner also
we can put :
for it becomes PN = z = b , on putting x = a. And in general, if P is any function of x
and z, A is now the same function that is produced on making x = a and z = b , and it
can be taken that PN = Pz
. Moreover P must be such a function that Pz vanishes on
A
making x = 0 and z = 0, and the differential of PN divided by dx must be a positive
quantity, for as long as x < a.

327. In a similar manner the most general problem can be solved, if on designating P as
some function of x vanishing if x = 0, and A is that quantity which P becomes if x = a, on
taking z = P Ab , for the most general equation for the curve AND. Then we have
Q b
dP = Qdx, Q must be a positive quantity, as long as x is not greater than a ; then p = A
and hence
which is the most general equation for the curves AMC, which are all completed by a
body descending in a proposed time. It is apparent in this way that transcendental curves
can also be substituted in place of the curves AND, in which cases the time, in which
some part of the curve AMC is completed, cannot be defined algebraically. If Q gbx is
put equal to R, then we have :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Therefore with some function of x taken in place of R in order to find A,

Rdx must be

integrated, so that it thus vanishes on putting x = 0; then it is required to put x = a, and as
that comes about, it is equal to A. Now here only this has advise has to be given, that a
positive quantity is taken for R, for as long as x does not exceed a, and it must be warned
that Rdx should not becomes infinite, if the integral is taken in the prescribed manner.
