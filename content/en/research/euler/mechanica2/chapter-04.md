Problem.

821. For a given path Mmμ on some surface (Fig. 91) to find the position of this path
with respect to a given plane APQ, and of the radius of osculation of this path at M, as
long as neither the position nor the length of the radius lies on the surface.

Solution.

With the plane APQ taken for argument's sake [in the plane of the page] and in that
plane the axis AP is taken, with respect to which the position of the curve Mmμ is to be
determined ; now from three nearby points M, m and μ of the given path on the surface
the perpendiculars MQ, mq, μρ are sent to the plane APQ and the perpendiculars QP, qp,
and ρπ [are dropped] from the points Q, q, ρ to the axis AP. Now the initial position of
the abscissa at A are AP = x, PQ = y and QM = z. Again since the given surface is put in 
place, an equation is given expressing the nature of this between these three variables x, y
and z; and this equation is [of the form]:
dz = Pdx + Qdy .
Since if this equation is connected with another, a certain line present on the surface is
expressed; whereby, as the given line Mmμ is put in place, as well as the equation
dz = Pdx + Qdy above, another equation is given, from which the curve Mmμ can be
determined, [p. 458] but there is no need to represent that here. Let the elements of the
abscissa Pp , pπ = dx be equal to each other, or the element is dx taken to be constant.
[The derivations that follow rely heavily on the section §68 onwards at the end of Ch. 1]
Hence there is:
and
With these in place, let MN be the normal to the surface at the point M, and N the point at
which this normal crosses the plane APQ ; the perpendicular NH is sent from N to the
axis ; then

and surfaces of revolution about an axis, so that only one radius of curvature has to be
found. You may wish to copy the above figure and annotate it, as this helps greatly in
understanding the working.]
Now let MR be the position of the line of the radius of osculation of the curve Mmμ and
R the point of incidence of this in the plane APQ; then with the perpendicular RX sent
from R to the axis :

produced until it intersects the plane APQ, and let the line of intersection be RKI, which
the perpendiculars from A and P cross at K and V; it was found above (68) that

Now the tangent of the angle NMR, that the radius of osculation makes with the normal to
the surface, is equal to (71) :
Therefore from these everything can be deduced that is required in understanding the
position of the curve Mmμ . Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.
822. The projection of the curve Mmμ in the plane APQ is the curve Qqρ , the nature of
which is expressed from the equation between x and y. Whereby this projection is
obtained, if with the help of the equations dz = Pdz + Qdy and that by which the curve is
determined on the surface, a new equation is formed from the elimination of the variable
z, which is between x and y only.
Corollary 2.
823. In a like manner, if x is eliminated, in order that an equation is produced between y
and z, from this equation the projection of the curve Mmμ is defined in the plane normal
to the axis AX. [p. 460] And the equation, in which y is not present, but only x and z,
gives the projection of the curve Mmμ in the plane normal to the plane APQ cutting the
axis AX.
Corollary 3.
824. But the nature of the curve Mmμ is known distinctly from any two of these normal
projections in two of the planes in turn. Such knowledge is also supplied by a single
projection together with the surface itself.
Corollary 4.
825. On account of which the curve on the surface is required to be designated by some
characters as well as the equation dz = Pdx + Qdy , from which surface is determined, and
an equation is given involving only two variables for some projection of the curve Mmμ .
Corollary 5.
826. If the surface is cut by a plane, in a like manner to that in which the cone is
accustomed to be cut producing the conic sections, then the curve arises from this section
is in the same plane. Whereby in these cases as the position of the right line IR is constant
so the inclination of the plane IMR to the plane APQ.
Example.
827. Therefore if some surface is given and that is cut by the plane IMR, the curve is
sought arising from this section. [p. 461] Accordingly, there is put in placeEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

from which the nature of the curve sought can be derived. Moreover because the whole
curve sought is in the plane IMR, most conveniently that can be expressed from the
equation between the orthogonal coordinates taken in the same plane. Hence with IR

830. Since the values to be substituted in place of z, y and x are of one dimension of t and

than the equation itself between z, y and x.
Corollary 9. [p. 463]
831. Whereby if the equation between z, y and x is of two dimensions, there are many
surfaces of this kind given in addition to the cone, all the sections made by a plane are
conic sections.

832. In that dissertation in Book III of the Commentaries [of the St. Petersburg Ac. of
Sc.], in which I have determined the shortest line on a surface, I have pursued three kinds
of surfaces, which are the cylinder, the cone, and the surface of revolution.
[L. Euleri Commentatio 9 (E09): Concerning the shortest line on a surface joining any
two points. Comment. acad. sc. Petrop. 3 (1728), 1732, p. 110; Opera Omnia series I, vol.
25.]
Now the general equation dz = Pdx + Qdy gives a cylindrical surface, if P vanishes
and Q depends only on y and z, thus so that the abscissa x does not enter the equation for
this kind of surface ; for all the sections are parallel to each other and are equal also ; for
these the equation is therefore dz = Qdy .
I refer all these surfaces to the genus of confides, which are generated by drawing
right lines from some points of an individual curve to a fixed point placed beyond the
plane of that curve. Which surfaces have this property, that all parallel sections are
similar to each other and the homologous lengths of these are as the distance of the
sections from the vertex of the cone. Now equations for the surfaces of this kind, if
indeed the vertex of the cone is at A, thus are compared, so that x, y and z everywhere
together constitute a number of the same dimensions.
Finally I have turned or rounded surfaces [of revolution], which are generated by the
rotation of any curve about an axis ; if AX were such an axis, on putting x constant, the
equation between y and z gives a circle with centre P. Whereby the equation for these has
this form : [p. 464]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

where Pz only depends on x ; or Q = − z and P = Xz with X present as a function of x.
Moreover as in these turned surfaces all the sections are circles normal to the axis,
thus such surfaces can be taken, the sections of which are any similar curves normal to
the axis. All such surfaces hold this general property, that any function of x is everywhere
equal to a function of y and z of the same number of dimensions. As, if the number of this
dimension is n, for this is a property of the equation Pdx = Rdz + Qdy that it is

Problem.
833. In any given surface to determine the line, that the body describes in that motion,
acted on by no forces either in a vacuum or in a medium with some kind of resistance.
Solution. [p. 465]
Because the body put in place is not acted on by any absolute forces, the line described
by that on the surface is the shortest line in vacuo (62). But the force of resistance in a
medium only diminishes the speed of the body and does not affect the direction in any
manner; whereby also in a medium with resistance the path described by the body on
some surface is equally the shortest. Therefore with the variables in place as before :
AP = x, PQ = y and QM = z, (Fig. 91) let dz = Pdx + Qdy be the equation expressing the
nature of the surface and Mm , mμ any two elements of the shortest line. From these
found above (69) for the shortest line, this is the equation:
Thus there arises :
But the equation for the surface differentiated gives :

Therefore with the element Mm given then the following element mμ on the shortest line
is found; for it is given by :
and the values of ddy and ddz have been found. Whereby hence the position of any
following element is determined and the nature of the shortest line by some projection of
these is known. Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.
834. If, in the equation for the surface P and Q are given in terms of x and y only, then the
equation
denotes the projection of the shortest line in the plane APQ. [p. 466]

835. Therefore for the shortest line Mmμ , with the elements selected equally from the
axis, then :

from which equations the point μ is known from the two preceding points M and m.
Corollary 3.
836. Because the angle RMN vanishes for the shortest line (71), R falls on N; hence the
position of the radius of osculation thus is obtained, in order that AX = x + Pz and
XR = −Qz − y . Now the length of the radius of osculation (73) is equal to :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Corollary 4.
837. Now the plane IMR, in which the shortest elements Mmμ are situated, is thus
determined, as it becomes :
and
Now the tangent of the angle, that the plane IMR makes with the plane APQ, is equal to :
The secant of this angle is equal to :
or the cosine is equal to :
Example 1. [p. 467]
838. Let some cylindrical surface have the axis AP; the nature of this is expressed by the
equation dz = Qdy with P vanishing in the general equation dz = Pdx + Qdy . Whereby for
the projection of the shortest line of this surface in the plane APQ on account of P = 0
and dP = 0 there is obtained this equation:
or
if indeed Q is only given in terms of y ; but if Q is given in terms of y and z, the variable
can be eliminated with the help of the equation dz = Qdy . As in the circular cylinder, in
which z 2 + y 2 = a 2 , then

Moreover in general, dy (1 + Q 2 ) expresses the arc of the section normal to the axis
AP; whereby with the said arc equal to s then αx = s . From which it is understood, if
such a surface is set out on a plane, to be the line of the shortest straight line, as agreed.
Example 2.
839. Let the proposed surface be some cone having the vertex at A; the equation for such
a surface thus can be adapted, so that z is equal to a function of one dimension of x and y.
Whereby in the equation dz = Pdx + Qdy the letters P and Q are functions of zero
dimensions of x and y. On this account, as now shown elsewhere, it follows that [see
E044] :
hence [on differentiation] there becomes : [p. 468]

and finally :
With which substituted, there is :
Put y = px ; P is equal to a certain function of p only, because P is a function of zero
dimensions of x and y. Now there is :

From which equation indeed the projection can hardly be recognized. Moreover how the
shortest line in such a surface is to be determined, I have set out in more detail in
Comment. III. p. 120, [E09 in this series of translations]. Moreover the same as before is
to be noted concerning the shortest line, clearly because that set out from the conical
surface becomes a straight line in the plane.
Scholium.
840. I will not tarry here with the determination in a similar manner of the shortest lines
on other forms of surfaces, since in the place cited I have set out this material more fully.
Hence I progress to the investigation of the lines which are described on a surface by a
body acted on by some forces. Now before this, it is necessary that we examine more
carefully the effect of each force.
Definition 4.
841. In the following we call the pressing force that normal force, the direction of which
is normal to the surface itself in which the body is moving.
Corollary. [p. 469]
842. Therefore this pressing force either increases or decreases the centrifugal force,
according as the direction of this force falls either opposite to the direction of the radius
of osculation of the shortest line, or in that direction (79).
Definition 5.
843. In the following we call the force of deflection that normal force, the direction of
which is on surface in the tangent plane, and perpendicular to the path described by the
body.
Corollary.
844. Hence this force deflects the body from the shortest line that the body describes
when acted on by no forces, and either draws the body to this or that side [of this line] as
the direction of this force either pulls the body this way or that.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

PROPOSITIO 92.
Problem.
845. To determine the effect of the pressing force on the body moving on any surface,
that is not acted on by any additional forces.
Solution. [p. 470]
Because this pressing force is normal to the surface and thus the direction of this is in
the direction MN, this affects neither the speed nor the direction, as the whole force is
taken up on pressing the surface, and therefore the body progresses on the same line on
which it was moving if this force were absent; but this is the shortest line determined in
the preceding proposition. Therefore the body is moving on the line Mmμ , and the radius
of osculation of this MO lies along the normal to the surface MN. Therefore let the
direction of this pressing force be MN, which therefore presses the surface inwards along
MN. This pressing force is put equal to M; by that the surface is pressed on by a force
along MN equal to M. But if the radius of osculation MO is put to lie along the same
[undirected] line, then the centrifugal force is contrary to the pressing force, and the
effect of this is lessened. Since moreover Mmμ is the shortest line, the radius of
osculation is (73) :
if twice the height v corresponding to the speed at M is divided by which, then the
centrifugal force is produced. On this account the force by which the surface is pressed
along MN, is equal toEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

[Note that the radius of curvature has been given as negative above for a concave curve
and the sign of this has been reversed, to give a greater force pressing into the curve.]
Finally the position of this pressing force has been found previously (68) :
AH = x + Pz and HN = −Qz − y ,
obviously on being sent from the point N, in which the normal MN intersects the plane
APQ, with the perpendicular NH to the axis .Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.
846. Since no another force is deflecting the normal force, neither a tangential force nor a
resistive force if that is present affect the force pressing on the surface, [p. 471], and it is
evident from any forces besides acting on the body that the pressing force is always to be
of such a size as we have assigned here.
Corollary 2.
847. Therefore however great the departure between the path described by the body from
the shortest line, the pressing force on the surface is still along the normal to the surface
or along the radius of osculation of the shortest line, not along the radius of osculation of
the curve described by the body, and neither is the length of this required for the pressing
force.
Scholium.
848. For that reason we have used that formula of the radius of curvature of the shortest
line, in which differentials of the second order are not present, lest these depend on the
positions of the two elements Mm and mμ , through which the body is itself moving. But
now the radius of osculation must be known from a single element Mm ; for if the body
does not describe the shortest line on account of a deflecting force, then differentials of
the second order ddy and ddz must be advance, not present in the radius of osculation of
the shortest line.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

849. To determine the effect on the motion of the body of the tangential force that pulls
the body along the tangent line MT (Fig.92) on some surface.
Solution. [p. 472]
Let this tangential force be equal to T and the body is
progressing through the element Mm with a speed
corresponding to the height v ; since this force diminishes
the motion, then
with the quantities maintaining the same denominations
that we have used previously. Now besides this force
does not affect either the pressing force nor by the
deviation from the shortest line. Now according to the
position of the direction of this force, the tangent MT is

On placing as before AP = x, PQ = y and
QM = z (Fig.93) the nature of the surface is
expressed by this equation :
dz = Pdx + Qdy

corresponding to the height v through the

does not advance to mμ , but is deflected forwards from this direction. Therefore we
place it to act along mν ; Mm and mν are two elements of the curve described by the
body. Whereby with the perpendicular να sent from ν to the plane APQ then :

Now on placing for brevity:
the radius of osculation corresponding to the angle between the elements μmν (72) is
equal to :
Therefore if we call the radius here equal to r, then N = 2rv or 2v = Nr , since here the
angle is generated in the same way in which a body in a plane is deflected from a straight
line by a normal force. Now it follows that : [p. 474]

852. This formula agrees with that which we have found previously (79) in determining
the effect of this kind of force. For the difference is only in the sign of the letter N, as it
was apparent that the force everywhere had to be taken as negative. And even here we
cannot be certain of the sign, because we have extracted it from the root of a squared
quantity, and it can be equally positive or negative. Now this doubt, if the calculus is
adapted to this special case, is at once removed, because the formula must be of this kind,
so that the point ν falls on this side of μ , if the force N is deflecting the body forwards,
in order that the direction should be as we have put in place. From which with the help of
an example the sign of the square root can also be determined and hence the formula
itself found.
Corollary 1. [p. 475]
853. If the deflecting force N vanishes, the body continues moving along its own shortest
line ; which is indicated by the equation also. For on putting N = 0 there is obtained
which is the equation for the shortest line :
Corollary 2.
854. Therefore whatever the pressing force and the tangential force and the force of the
resistance acting on the body moving on the surface, only if nothing aids the deflecting
force, then the body always moves along the shortest line [now called geodesic curves].
Scholium 2.
855. Moreover as concerning the position of this deflecting force N, that can be deduced
as follows, since that force is placed on the surface in the tangent plane and likewise it is
normal to the curve described, therefore let MG
(Fig. 94) be the direction of this force and G is the
point at which it crosses the plane APQ , thus so
that the force N can be thought to pull along the
line MG, while that force we have put before to be
deflecting and pressing forwards. Therefore in the
first place it is necessary to determine the
intersection of the plane of the tangent of the
surface at M with the plane APQ, which is the right
line TVG ; now this can be found, if two tangents of
the surface can be produced as far as the plane
APQ, and the points in which they are incident on
the plane APQ are joined by a right line. Therefore
let MT be the tangent of the described line, which in addition is a tangent of the surface
also ; then as we have now established, [p. 476]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

(849). Again the surface is understood to be cut by the plane PQM and let MV be the
tangent of this cut ; then we have QV = Qz from the equation dz = Pdx + Qdy on putting
dx = 0 [or, from the subtangent]. Therefore the point V is known, on account of which the
line TV produced is the intersection of the tangent plane of the surface at M with the
plane APQ. Therefore the point G, in which the line MG crosses the plane APQ, is placed
on the line TV. Again there is taken on the line TQ :
and MS is the normal described to the element Mm. And if the normal SG is drawn to QS,
from this line SG all the right lines drawn to M are perpendicular to the element Mm.
[Thus, the element Mm is normal to the plane MSG.] Whereby since MG is also normal to
the element described, the point G is also placed on the line SG. Hence the point G is at
the intersection of the lines TV and SG. Now it is the case that :
