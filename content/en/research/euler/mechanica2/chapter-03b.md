505. According to the hypothesis of uniform gravity g, and in a medium with some uniform resistance, to determine the motion of the body with the initial speed of ascent given at A (Fig.62) on the straight line AB inclined at some angle to the horizontal.

Solution.

With the line AC drawn to the horizontal and with the perpendicular MP drawn to that from M , call PM = x, and let AM = nx. Let the height corresponding to the initial speed at A be equal to b and the height corresponding to the speed at M be equal to v; now the resistance at M is equal to VK .

perpendicular MP drawn to that from M , call PM = x, and let
AM = nx. Let the height corresponding to the initial speed at A
be equal to b and the height corresponding to the speed at M be
equal to v; now the resistance at M is equal to VK . With these in

− Kdv and x =

dx = gK

gK + nV

with this integral thus taken, so that it vanishes on putting v = b.
If then we put v = 0, then there is produced x = BC, where the
body has lost all the speed at the point B. Now the time, in
which the body ascends along AM, is equal to
∫

∫ ( gK−+Kdv

with this integral also taken so that it vanishes on putting v = b; in which if again we put
v = 0, the time for the whole ascent along AMB is found. Moreover the force sustained by
the line AMB is everywhere constant, and equal to the normal force

Hence the total height BC, to which the body is able to reach,

Now the time in which it rises along AM is equal to :
Whereby the time of the whole ascent along AMB is equal to :
Therefore if the body descends on the inclined line AC (Fig. 63) and with the speed
acquired at C ascends on CB as far B and let AC = N .AD and BC = n.BE and the speed at
C corresponds to the height b, then (486)
And the descent time along AC =

straight lines can be compared with each other.

Corollary 4.

510. If these logarithms are expressed in series, it is clear that it is not possible that BE =
AD ; for according to any hypothesis of the resistance, as it is understood from the series
(508 and 488), that we have BE < bg and AD > bg . But it can happen that AC = BC.

Hence we have n > N or angle BCE < angle ACD. Moreover, the relation between N and
n depends on the speed at the point C.

512. But if the angle BCE is equal to the angle ACD or N = n, the ascent time along BC is
less than the descent time along AC. And this generally is the position for any hypothesis
of the resistance; for the time of the descent along CB < 2ng b , as is apparent from the
series given above ((488) and (508)).

the height b upon some line CM reaches the curve
AMD. For on putting CM = z and MP = x then

If we put y = 0, then both x = 0 and x = g = CA. Hence the curve also passes through
the point C, which moreover ceases to satisfy the part of this question on account of the
following neglected terms, which have been wrongly ignored, if n or xz is also made very
large. Now the equation gives a curve in the form of an ellipse with the maximum length
described about the minor axis AC. But the true curve has the form AMD, the asymptote

which the motion can be most easily determined; the same too is to be observed, if the
force acting is not uniform. As the force is set equal to P and the resistance equal to VQ ,

these put in place the motion of the body upon any curve is expressed by this equation :

On the vertical axis is taken the abscissa AP = x and
the arc is put AM = s, the speed at M corresponds to the
height v, and k is the exponent of the resistance ; the
resistance is equal to kv . On account of which this

(465). On multiplying that to be integrated by e k , there
is the integral :
s
∫
s
e k v = e k gdx
Moreover with this integral it must be taken thus, so that on putting s = 0 there comes
about the height v corresponding to the initial speed at A. Therefore if the descent is put
s
to be made from rest, e k gdx thus must be integrated, so that the speed vanishes on putting
s = 0. And thus with this done, we have :

from A with the speed b to N and from N it again falls through NA and the speed that it
then has at A corresponds to the height c, [p. 277] then from A it can reach n with a speed
corresponding to the height b + db, hence again on descending to A it acquires a speed

548. In the solution of this proposition it is required to be examined, since by determining
only the formula for the descents we have also derived the ascent of the body on the
curve CN ; from which it is possible that doubt arises, or that the true ascent is defined.
But this is evidently easy to be derived from the formula for the ascent. Indeed we have
been using this formula dv = gdx − Rds , in which with the point M falling beyond the
point C as dx has been made negative is changed into : dv = − gdx − Rds , which actually
contains the nature of the ascent. From these the continuity between the ascent and the
descent is understood, which touch each other with no jump in between. [p. 282] Where
indeed the curve itself begins to change direction and rise, where the like formula
serving the descent is changed freely into the formula for the ascent. And this junction
has a place in a medium with some kind of resistance, as is apparent from the general
formulas, which only disagree with the sign of dx . On account of which it is not
necessary from the given equation for some curve, that the body ascending or descending
on one part of the curve or the other is sought, as either formula can be adapted to the
equation and gives the true motion on the proposed curve. Only this has to be understood,
that the abscissae are taken on the vertical axis, and that formula either for the ascent or

Towards determining the time, it is agreed to consider the maximum speed at the point O
and to define the time along MO. On this account I put the height corresponding to the
speed at O equal to c and the arc MO = q; then we have : [p. 284]
With these put in place, the height corresponding to the speed at M, or v, is equal to:

Now because v in less than c, put c – v = z and the equation becomes :

From which on being converted, it becomes
The descent starts from the point M; there v = 0 and z = c and thus :
From the same formula, if q is made negative, then the motion along OCN is obtained;

Now the time for the motion along MO is found in this manner: since
this divided by v = (c − z ) gives an element of the time equal to
Which thus must be integrated, so that it vanishes on putting v = c or z = 0 ; then if we
put z = c, the time is obtained in which the body descends along the arc MO. Therefore
this time, with the ratio of the periphery of the circle to the diameter put as π to 1, is
equal to [p. 285]

553. It is apparent from the equation setting out the time, that the time in which the body
arrives at O from M, is always less than the time in which the body reaches as far as N
from O. In a similar manner also the arc ON is greater than the arc OM, and now the arc
CN is less than the arc MC.
Corollary 5.
554. If the oscillations should become infinitely small or c becomes a vanishing quantity,
then the oscillations agree with the oscillations made in vacuo ; for in the individual
expressions the same terms vanish, which vanish on putting k =∝ . Therefore
isochronous with the smallest oscillations of a pendulum of length a in vacuo acted on by
a force g , or of a pendulum according to the hypothesis of gravity equal to 1, the length
of which is equal to ag .
[This agrees with modern analysis, and reinforces the belief considered earlier, that Euler
is using a set of units in which the second and the acceleration of gravity are taken as
one.]
Corollary 6. [p. 287]
554. But if the oscillations become greater, then the times of the oscillations also become
greater; whereby according to the hypothesis of resistance the cycloid is not favoured
with the property of tautochronism. For when the maximum speed is made greater in
some oscillation, the greater also is the excess of the time of the oscillation of this kind
over the time of the smallest oscillation.
Scholium 1.
556. Since we have said that the smallest oscillations agree with oscillations in vacuo,
then the situation arises that a and k are quantities of finite size. For if a should be
infinitely large or k infinitely small, the following terms express the time :
that do not vanish, even if c should be indefinitely small. Moreover, therefore, only the
smallest oscillations upon some curve agree with the oscillations in vacuo and in a
resisting medium, when neither the radius of osculation of the curve at the lowest point is
infinitely large nor the resistance infinitely great.
Example.
557. We explain the case by means of an example, in which the resistance is so small and
thus the quantity k so large that the fractions in the denominators of which k has more
than two dimensions can be put equal to zero without harm. Therefore with the aforesaid

progression of the same starting value, [and ratio 23nE

560. Hence it is clear that the diminution of the arcs does not depend on the length of the
pendulum, but from n and E given the same arc L is found, whatever the length a of the
pendulum should be. and n is always proportional to L1 − E1 .
Scholium 2. [p. 290]
561. Newton examines experiments of this kind concerning oscillations in a resisting
medium in Phil. Book. II, where he observes the first descending arc, the final
descending arc, and the number of oscillations for [a pendulum] in air, as in water and
mercury. Whereby if the mediums resisted perfectly in the ratio of the square of the
speed, there should be agreement with these formulas, thus in order that the decrease of
the arc should be proportional to the number of oscillations, and both the first and the
final arcs taken together. Since also the situation arises for larger oscillations to be
observed, in which the speed is not extremely small. But in the smallest oscillations the
greatest aberration from this rule is observed. From which it is gathered, when the speed
of the body in the fluid is made greater, the resistance to that falls closer to the ratio of the
square of the speeds, but the slowest motion is liable to be affected by other resistances,
which vanishes in motions for speeds with the previous resistance, which is proportional
to the square of the speeds. Also in these experiments, Newton assumed that the
resistance was in part simply proportional to the ratio of the speed, partly as the speed to
the three on two power, and partly as the square of the speeds, yet this was not
satisfactory for the slowest motions. Now in the final Phil. edition Newton recognises theEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

insufficiency of his own initial theory and by many other reasons he shows that another
resistance of the fluid to be constant, or proportional to the lengths of time, as before he
had considered for the proportionality with the speeds. Hence on account of this, in the
following proposition we will consider joining that resistance with this, which is
proportional to the square of the speed, since the resolution of the equation and the
determination of the speed with this addition does not present any more special difficulty.
[The interested reader should consult Cohen's translation of the third ed. of the Principia,
where these matters of Newton are discussed at some length. Cohen's work is remarkable
for the complete lack of comment on the follow-up to Newton that we are providing here.
One wonders why Newton has been 'done to death' as it were by numerous
commentaries, while this wonderful work of Euler has been hidden in the closet, as it
were, for centuries.........]
Corollary 10. [p. 291]
562. Since according to the times of the oscillations and the semi oscillations [the
pendulum] attains, it is evident that this decreases when the arc described becomes
smaller, and if the arcs completely vanish, then the time of half an oscillation becomes
equal to π 2a .

563. Moreover the excess of the time of this half oscillation over the smallest half
oscillation in the case of the smallest resistance is πE 2 2a with E denoting the descent of

this half oscillation. Whereby the excess itself is in proportion to the square of the arc
descended or also to the square of the whole arc of the half oscillation described.
Scholium 3.
564. Therefore the cycloid, that has been suitably described by Huygens according to the
production of isochronous pendulums, loses this property on account of the resistance in
proportional to the square of the speeds, and hence is not serviceable in air, unless the
oscillations are very small or are almost equal to each other. [p. 292] Now from this,
since larger oscillations endure a long time, it is possible to gather that the true
tautochrone curve according to this hypothesis of the resistance to be more curved than
the cycloid. As clearly the cycloid is continued in a circle of the same radius, of which
the cycloid is the lowest point, thus also the true tautochrone will be continued in a
cycloid and with the curvature decreased more from the lowest point than with the

526. Existente potentia sollicitante uniformi et medio uniformi resistente in duplicata
ratione celeritatum, determinare motum corporis ascendentis super data curva AMD

Solutio.
In linea verticali AP ponatur abscissa AP = x, the arc
AM = s, the speed at A corresponds to the height b and
the speed at M to the height v. Let the force acting
downwards be equal to g and let the resistance be equal
to kv . With these in place, then
dv = − gdx − vds
