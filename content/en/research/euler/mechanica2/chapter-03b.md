PROPOSITION 58. Problem.

505. According to the hypothesis of uniform gravity g, and in a medium with some uniform resistance, to determine the motion of the body with the initial speed of ascent given at A (Fig.62) on the straight line AB inclined at some angle to the horizontal.

Solution.

With the line AC drawn to the horizontal and with the perpendicular MP drawn to that from M , call PM = x, and let AM = nx. Let the height corresponding to the initial speed at A be equal to b and the height corresponding to the speed at M be equal to v; now the resistance at M is equal to VK . With these in place, there is the equation :

dv = − gdx − nVdx
K
(479), hence there is obtained
− Kdv and x =
− Kdv
dx = gK
+ nV
gK + nV

with this integral thus taken, so that it vanishes on putting v = b.
If then we put v = 0, then there is produced x = BC, where the
body has lost all the speed at the point B. Now the time, in
which the body ascends along AM, is equal to
∫
[p. 261]
∫ ( gK−+Kdv
nV ) v
with this integral also taken so that it vanishes on putting v = b; in which if again we put
v = 0, the time for the whole ascent along AMB is found. Moreover the force sustained by
the line AMB is everywhere constant, and equal to the normal force
g ( n 2 −1)
n
. Q.E.I.


Corollary 1.

506. If the line AMB is horizontal, then with the angle BAC vanishing, n becomes ∝ .
Therefore on putting AM = z = nz , there is found

z = − Kdv
V
∫
and the time, in which the body progresses along AM , is equal to
− Kdv .
∫V v

Corollary 2.

507. If the resistance is as some power 2m of the speeds, then we have
V = v m and K = k m . Therefore in this case, there becomes :
x=
∫
− k m dv
gk m + nv m
and the time to pass along AM is equal to :
∫ ( gk −+knvdv) v .
m
m
m

Corollary 3.

508. This expression and the other converted into series give
and the time to pass along AM is equal to :
[p. 262] On account of which, on putting v = 0, the series becomes
and the time of the whole ascent along AB is equal to :


Example 1.

509. Let the resistance be proportional to the speed, then m = 12 and
Hence the total height BC, to which the body is able to reach,

Now the time in which it rises along AM is equal to :
Whereby the time of the whole ascent along AMB is equal to :
Therefore if the body descends on the inclined line AC (Fig. 63) and with the speed
acquired at C ascends on CB as far B and let AC = N .AD and BC = n.BE and the speed at
C corresponds to the height b, then (486)
And the descent time along AC =
(cit.) and the ascent time along CB =
[p. 263] Hence the descent and the ascent on the
straight lines can be compared with each other.

Corollary 4.

510. If these logarithms are expressed in series, it is clear that it is not possible that BE =
AD ; for according to any hypothesis of the resistance, as it is understood from the series
(508 and 488), that we have BE < bg and AD > bg . But it can happen that AC = BC.

Corollary 5.

511. Moreover it is easily demonstrated that the descent time along AC is equal to the
ascent time along CB. Clearly this must become
ng k = Ng k + Nn b or n =
Ng k
g k −N b

Hence we have n > N or angle BCE < angle ACD. Moreover, the relation between N and
n depends on the speed at the point C.

Corollary 6.

512. But if the angle BCE is equal to the angle ACD or N = n, the ascent time along BC is
less than the descent time along AC. And this generally is the position for any hypothesis
of the resistance; for the time of the descent along CB < 2ng b , as is apparent from the
series given above ((488) and (508)).

Example 2.

513. The medium resists in the ratio of the square of the speeds; then m = 1 . Whereby
there is obtained :
− kdv
gk + nb
x=
= kn l gk + nv
gk + nv
and (Fig. 62)
∫
gk + nb
gk + nb
BC = kn l gk and AB = kl gk
Now the time of the descent along AM is equal to
.
with the radius equal to 1 and with A denoting the arc of the circle. Hence the ascent time
along AB is equal to
If now the body descends along the inclined line AC (Fig. 63) and with the speed at C
acquired, which corresponds to the height b, it ascends along CB again where
AC = N .AD and BC = n.BE , then we have :

gk
gk
AD = Nk l gk − Nb and AC = kl gk − Nb
page 413
and the time of descent along AC is equal to :
(407). Now again we have : and the time of the ascent along CB is equal to :

Corollary 7.

514. In this hypothesis of the resistance it is convenient to put AC = BC; for it must
become
Ngk
ngk = Ngk + Nnb or n = gk − Nb .
Hence we have n > N, and hence the angle BCE < the angle ACD.

Example 3.

515. Let the resistance be taken as very small and proportional to the 2m th power of the
speed; then k is a very large quantity. [p. 265] If therefore the speed at C corresponds to
the height b, AC = N .AD and BC = n.BE , and the body descends on the line AC and
ascends on the line CB , then
and the time of descent along AC is equal to :
(488). Now for the ascent,
and the time to pass along CB is equal to :
(508). If therefore it is to be brought about that AC = BC, then it is required that thus this becomes :
since k is a very large quantity. But where the time of the descent along AC is equal to the
time of the ascent along CB, it must be the case that :
or
Scholium 1.

516. In the case of this example, where the resistance is very small, the curve AMD (Fig.
64) can be determined by this property, as the body
by ascending from C with a speed corresponding to
the height b upon some line CM reaches the curve
AMD. For on putting CM = z and MP = x then
n = xz and
Whereby this equation is obtained :
Let CP = y and let f be written in place of
b m+1
,
( m +1) gk m
and there arises :
or
b− f
If we put y = 0, then both x = 0 and x = g = CA. Hence the curve also passes through
the point C, which moreover ceases to satisfy the part of this question on account of the
following neglected terms, which have been wrongly ignored, if n or xz is also made very
large. Now the equation gives a curve in the form of an ellipse with the maximum length
described about the minor axis AC. But the true curve has the form AMD, the asymptote
of which is the horizontal line CE, if indeed m > 1 , the equation of this curve is obtained
with all the terms taken, which is :

If m < 1, then the curve does not progress to infinity, but falls on CE by taking
CE =
bk m .
(1− m)b m
For if m < 1, the body is not able to progress to infinity, but all the speed is lost after a
finite distance.


Scholium 2.

517. If the resistance of the medium is not uniform, then the line is not straight upon
which the motion can be most easily determined; the same too is to be observed, if the
force acting is not uniform. As the force is set equal to P and the resistance equal to VQ ,
where Q is such a function of the exponent of the variable resistance q, as V is of v; with
these put in place the motion of the body upon any curve is expressed by this equation :
i.e.
Hence this is the equation of this curve, upon which the motion is most easily defined :
PQdx = Ads ,
and from which the following arises :

determining the motion on this curve, in which the indeterminates can be separated from
each other. Whereby if we might wish to pursue hypotheses of this kind, we must assume
in place of the straight lines curves expressed by this equation PQdx = Ads . But since we
have decided to handle further only the hypothesis of uniform forces acting and uniform
resistance, with these dismissed we progress to these cases, in which v has only a single
dimension, that which arises if the resistance is proportional to the square of the speed.

PROPOSITION 59. Problem.

518. According to the hypothesis of uniform gravity g and with the resistance
proportional to the square of the speed, the body descends on some curve AMB (Fig.57);
to determine the motion of this body, and the force sustained by the curve at individual
points. [p. 268]

Solution.

On the vertical axis is taken the abscissa AP = x and
the arc is put AM = s, the speed at M corresponds to the
height v, and k is the exponent of the resistance ; the
resistance is equal to kv . On account of which this
equation is had setting out the motion of the body :
dv = gdx − vds
k
s
(465). On multiplying that to be integrated by e k , there
is the integral :
s
∫
s
e k v = e k gdx
Moreover with this integral it must be taken thus, so that on putting s = 0 there comes
about the height v corresponding to the initial speed at A. Therefore if the descent is put
s
to be made from rest, e k gdx thus must be integrated, so that the speed vanishes on putting
s = 0. And thus with this done, we have :
−s
∫

v = ge k e k dx.
Hence the time to traverse AM is equal to :

Now on placing PM = y and on taking dx constant the force sustained by the curve at M
along the normal MN is equal to :
Q.E.I.

Corollary 1. [p. 269]

519. The force that the curve sustains can be changed into this form :
s
which, upon integrating e k dx for the given curve, is more convenient to apply to any
case.

tangent at A and the body remains there permanently.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Corollary 4

522. In a similar manner it is also evident, if x is some power of s or a sum of powers of
s
this kind, then it is always possible to integrate e k dx and thus the terminal speed can be
shown.

Corollary 5

523. Moreover if the abscissae are taken on the vertical axis BQ and the speed that the
body has at B corresponds to the height b, and besides calling BQ = x and BM = s, then
dv = − gdx − vds

the integral of this equation is :

Corollary 6

524. Therefore if the speed is given at the point B, clearly b , it is possible to find the
point A on the curve BMA, from which the body always begins its descent and has the
speed equal to zero. Whereby this is clearly the place where
∫
e − k dx = bg .

525. Thus we have presented two ways in which the motion can be investigated : as it
can be adapted to the descent made from a given point, or the descent as far as a given
point is considered, as is usually the case in oscillatory motion.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

526. With the force arising acting uniformly and with a uniform medium with resistance
in the square ratio of the speed, to determine the motion of the body ascending on the
given curve AMD (Fig.58) and the force pressing on the curve sustained at individual
points M.

Solution.

The abscissa AP = x is placed on the vertical line AP,
the arc AM = s, the speed at A corresponds to the height
b and the speed at M to the height v. Let the force acting
downwards be equal to g and the resistance is equal to
v . With these in place, then

from which equation the point D is obtained, and to which the body is able to ascend

put in the expression for the time.

Corollary 2

528. If, in the formula showing the force pressing, in place of v this value found is
substituted, then there is obtained :
Which it is possible to change into this form :

Corollary 3. [p. 273]

529. Now for the descent, if the speed at A also corresponds to the height b, then the
pressing force that the curve sustains at M along the normal MN is equal to :

Corollary 4.

530. If therefore the ascent as well as the descent are defined with respect to the axis AP,
the equation determining the ascent can be changed into the equation for the descent by
writing – k in place of k in turn. Whereby if the descent has been determined on the
curve AM, then the ascent can also be determined in turn.

Scholium

531. Since the formulas determining the ascent and the descent have so much in common,
the ascents and the descents can easily be compared with each other, and thus the
oscillations on a given curve can be determined. We present this in the following
proposition, as generally as it can be done. 

PROPOSITION 61. Problem

532. Let whatever curves MA and NA (Fig.65) be joined at the lowest point A and the
body descends on the curve [MA and ascends on the curve] AN in a medium with uniform
resistance following the square of the speeds; to be compares between themselves are the
descends on the curve MA and the ascents on the curve AN.

Solution.

Let the speed at the point A correspond to the height b and on the vertical axis AP the
abscissa AP = x, and the arc AM = s. Now for the curve AN, the ascent shall be AQ = t
and AN = r. With these in place, the speed of the body descending at M corresponds to
the height
e k b − ge k e − k dx

(523). Now the speed of the body ascending on the curve AN at N corresponds to the
height :

Now if another semi–oscillation completing the arc mMn is taken, in which the speed at
the point A corresponds to the height b + db, then
b + db =

Hence for the given arc MAN described by a single oscillation, if the body begins to

point above N ; clearly it is

Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.
533. Therefore if MAN and mAn are two arcs described by neighbouring oscillations, then
always Qq < Pp and from this Qq is less than Pp, in which the sum of the arcs AM + AN
is greater. Therefore also, AQ shall always be less than AP.
Corollary 2.
AM + AN

534. In vacuo, since k =∝ , then e
= 1 ; and the above equation becomes Qq = Pp
and hence AQ = AP. Whereby the body oscillating in vacuo ascends to as great a height,
as that from which it descends.
Corollary 3.
535. If the resistance is very small and thus k extremely large, then

538. From what has been said another elegant property follows, for if the body ascends
from A with the speed b to N and from N it again falls through NA and the speed that it
then has at A corresponds to the height c, [p. 277] then from A it can reach n with a speed
corresponding to the height b + db, hence again on descending to A it acquires a speed
corresponding to the height c + dc. Hence

539. It remains, that we adapt these generalisations to examples or given curves, where
the use of these will there become more apparent. Moreover we take only the cycloid for
∫
s
the given curve, as there the integral e k dx can be easily demonstrated and also the
equation between s and x is algebraic. Hence we will examine both descents made on
cycloids as well as oscillations, from which it is apparent to what extent the oscillations
made on the cycloid depart from being isochronous, clearly in vacuo all have been shown
to be completed in the same time.

PROPOSITION 62. Problem.

540. Let the given curve be the cycloid ACB (Fig.66) described by the circle of diameter
CD rolling along upon the given horizontal base AB, and the body descends on that
cycloid from A in a medium with the resistance proportional to the square of the speed;
to determine the motion of the descending body. [p. 278]

Solution.

On placing 2CD = a, AL = x and AM = s then from the nature of the cycloid :
s = a − (a 2 − 2ax) or 2ax = 2as − ss.
Now the speed at M corresponds to the height v; then

from which the value of s gives the arc length ACN, by which the body is able to travel
so far by its own motion.

to :
Whereby the arc is given by [the following expressions have been corrected as in O. O. ]:
and

548. In the solution of this proposition it is required to be examined, since by determining
only the formula for the descents we have also derived the ascent of the body on the
curve CN ; from which it is possible that doubt arises, or that the true ascent is defined.
But this is evidently easy to be derived from the formula for the ascent. Indeed we have
been using this formula dv = gdx − Rds , in which with the point M falling beyond the
point C as dx has been made negative is changed into : dv = − gdx − Rds , which actually
contains the nature of the ascent. From these the continuity between the ascent and the
descent is understood, which touch each other with no jump in between. [p. 282] Where
indeed the curve itself begins to change direction and rise, where the like formula
serving the descent is changed freely into the formula for the ascent. And this junction
has a place in a medium with some kind of resistance, as is apparent from the general
formulas, which only disagree with the sign of dx . On account of which it is not
necessary from the given equation for some curve, that the body ascending or descending
on one part of the curve or the other is sought, as either formula can be adapted to the
equation and gives the true motion on the proposed curve. Only this has to be understood,
that the abscissae are taken on the vertical axis, and that formula either for the ascent or
of the descent is adhered to, which agrees with the initial motion.

PROPOSITION 63. Problem.

549. Let the given curve ACB (Fig.66) be a cycloid described on the horizontal base AB
and considering the body to complete downwards oscillations on that curve in a medium
with resistance in the square ratio of the speeds; to determine the motion of the
oscillations.

Solution.

The diameter of the circle is put as CD = 12 a and on that is taken the abscissa CP = x
and the arc CM is called s ; then from the nature of the cycloid, it follows that
s = 2ax , x = 2ssa , and dx = sds

Now the body descends on the arc MC and let the speed of this at C correspond to the
height b; then the height that corresponds to the speed at M is equal to :

Towards determining the time, it is agreed to consider the maximum speed at the point O
and to define the time along MO. On this account I put the height corresponding to the
speed at O equal to c and the arc MO = q; then we have : [p. 284]
With these put in place, the height corresponding to the speed at M, or v, is equal to:

Now because v in less than c, put c – v = z and the equation becomes :

From which on being converted, it becomes
The descent starts from the point M; there v = 0 and z = c and thus :
From the same formula, if q is made negative, then the motion along OCN is obtained;
but since in the same way, if q or k is made negative, if N is the point of maximum
ascent of the body, the arc ON is equal to :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Now the time for the motion along MO is found in this manner: since
this divided by v = (c − z ) gives an element of the time equal to
Which thus must be integrated, so that it vanishes on putting v = c or z = 0 ; then if we
put z = c, the time is obtained in which the body descends along the arc MO. Therefore
this time, with the ratio of the periphery of the circle to the diameter put as π to 1, is
equal to [p. 285]
Therefore on putting k negative, the time in which the body ascends from O as far as N, is
equal to :
Therefore the time to travel along MCN or the time of one half oscillation, is equal to :

Corollary 4.
553. It is apparent from the equation setting out the time, that the time in which the body
arrives at O from M, is always less than the time in which the body reaches as far as N
from O. In a similar manner also the arc ON is greater than the arc OM, and now the arc
CN is less than the arc MC.
Corollary 5.
554. If the oscillations should become infinitely small or c becomes a vanishing quantity,
then the oscillations agree with the oscillations made in vacuo ; for in the individual
expressions the same terms vanish, which vanish on putting k =∝ . Therefore
isochronous with the smallest oscillations of a pendulum of length a in vacuo acted on by
a force g , or of a pendulum according to the hypothesis of gravity equal to 1, the length
of which is equal to ag .
[This agrees with modern analysis, and reinforces the belief considered earlier, that Euler
is using a set of units in which the second and the acceleration of gravity are taken as
one.]
Corollary 6. [p. 287]
554. But if the oscillations become greater, then the times of the oscillations also become
greater; whereby according to the hypothesis of resistance the cycloid is not favoured
with the property of tautochronism. For when the maximum speed is made greater in
some oscillation, the greater also is the excess of the time of the oscillation of this kind
over the time of the smallest oscillation.

556. Since we have said that the smallest oscillations agree with oscillations in vacuo,
then the situation arises that a and k are quantities of finite size. For if a should be
infinitely large or k infinitely small, the following terms express the time :
that do not vanish, even if c should be indefinitely small. Moreover, therefore, only the
smallest oscillations upon some curve agree with the oscillations in vacuo and in a
resisting medium, when neither the radius of osculation of the curve at the lowest point is
infinitely large nor the resistance infinitely great.
Example.
557. We explain the case by means of an example, in which the resistance is so small and
thus the quantity k so large that the fractions in the denominators of which k has more
than two dimensions can be put equal to zero without harm. Therefore with the aforesaid

Corollary 7. [p. 289]
558. If n half oscillations are made, the descending arc of the first oscillation is E, and
the final ascending arc is equal to L, then
which expression, if taken with the nearby series, almost agrees with the geometric
progression of the same starting value, [and ratio 23nE
]and on this account it follows that

559. Hence, for some number of oscillations performed, if the first descending arc of the
first oscillation E is given together with the final ascending arc L, it is possible to find the
number of oscillations; for it is in fact
Corollary 9.
560. Hence it is clear that the diminution of the arcs does not depend on the length of the
pendulum, but from n and E given the same arc L is found, whatever the length a of the
pendulum should be. and n is always proportional to L1 − E1 .

561. Newton examines experiments of this kind concerning oscillations in a resisting
medium in Phil. Book. II, where he observes the first descending arc, the final
descending arc, and the number of oscillations for [a pendulum] in air, as in water and
mercury. Whereby if the mediums resisted perfectly in the ratio of the square of the
speed, there should be agreement with these formulas, thus in order that the decrease of
the arc should be proportional to the number of oscillations, and both the first and the
final arcs taken together. Since also the situation arises for larger oscillations to be
observed, in which the speed is not extremely small. But in the smallest oscillations the
greatest aberration from this rule is observed. From which it is gathered, when the speed
of the body in the fluid is made greater, the resistance to that falls closer to the ratio of the
square of the speeds, but the slowest motion is liable to be affected by other resistances,
which vanishes in motions for speeds with the previous resistance, which is proportional
to the square of the speeds. Also in these experiments, Newton assumed that the
resistance was in part simply proportional to the ratio of the speed, partly as the speed to
the three on two power, and partly as the square of the speeds, yet this was not
satisfactory for the slowest motions. Now in the final Phil. edition Newton recognises theEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

insufficiency of his own initial theory and by many other reasons he shows that another
resistance of the fluid to be constant, or proportional to the lengths of time, as before he
had considered for the proportionality with the speeds. Hence on account of this, in the
following proposition we will consider joining that resistance with this, which is
proportional to the square of the speed, since the resolution of the equation and the
determination of the speed with this addition does not present any more special difficulty.
[The interested reader should consult Cohen's translation of the third ed. of the Principia,
where these matters of Newton are discussed at some length. Cohen's work is remarkable
for the complete lack of comment on the follow-up to Newton that we are providing here.
One wonders why Newton has been 'done to death' as it were by numerous
commentaries, while this wonderful work of Euler has been hidden in the closet, as it
were, for centuries.........]
Corollary 10. [p. 291]
562. Since according to the times of the oscillations and the semi oscillations [the
pendulum] attains, it is evident that this decreases when the arc described becomes
smaller, and if the arcs completely vanish, then the time of half an oscillation becomes
equal to π 2a .

563. Moreover the excess of the time of this half oscillation over the smallest half
oscillation in the case of the smallest resistance is πE 2 2a with E denoting the descent of

this half oscillation. Whereby the excess itself is in proportion to the square of the arc
descended or also to the square of the whole arc of the half oscillation described.

564. Therefore the cycloid, that has been suitably described by Huygens according to the
production of isochronous pendulums, loses this property on account of the resistance in
proportional to the square of the speeds, and hence is not serviceable in air, unless the
oscillations are very small or are almost equal to each other. [p. 292] Now from this,
since larger oscillations endure a long time, it is possible to gather that the true
tautochrone curve according to this hypothesis of the resistance to be more curved than
the cycloid. As clearly the cycloid is continued in a circle of the same radius, of which
the cycloid is the lowest point, thus also the true tautochrone will be continued in a
cycloid and with the curvature decreased more from the lowest point than with the
curvature of the cycloid.
