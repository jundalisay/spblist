THE MOTION OF A POINT ON A GIVEN LINE IN A MEDIUM WITH RESISTANCE.

PROPOSITION 68. Problem.

602. In a uniform medium, which resists in the ratio of the quadruple of the speeds, so to
determine any ascent or descent of the body on the cycloid ACB (Fig.66).

Solution .

The body is continually drawn downwards
by a uniform force g, and with the
abscissa CP = x and the arc CM = s, from the
nature of the cycloid, it follows that dx = sds

Or, the difference between the arc of the descent and the arc of the ascent is proportional
to the sum of the arcs. [p. 321] From which it is seen to be a consequence in any rarest
medium, that resists in the ratio of the 2m th power of the speeds, the difference between
the arc of the ascent and of the descent on a cycloid is proportional to the power of the
sum of the arcs of the ascent and of the descent, and the exponent of this is 2m. And for
this hypothesis of the resistance it is allowed to assign the arc of the descent :
and the arc of the ascent :
Hence this gives :

Principia [Book. II, Prop. XXXI] which is, that the difference between the arcs of the
descent and of the ascent on a cycloid is as the sum of the arcs raised to the whole power
of whatever power the resistance present has in proportion to the ratio of the speeds, if
indeed the resistance is the smallest. And it is also possible to derive this from the

607. In a medium that resists in the ratio of the quadruple power of the ratio of the
speeds, if the speed of the descent of the body on the curve AMC from a given point A is
given (Fig.67) at individual points, to find the speed of the same body beginning at some
other point E.
Solution.
On putting CP = x and CM = s let the speed of the
body fallen from A at M correspond to the height u,
which quantity u by hypothesis is given by x and s. Now
if the body starts the descend from some other point E,
let the speed at M correspond to the height v. Now the

612. As the hypothesis with the resistance proportional to the squares of the speeds,
before other hypothesis except that in which the resistance is constant, has this
outstanding property, that the speed of any body moving on any curve can be defined at
all places from the equation of the curve, thus this hypothesis of the resistance excels in
this respect before the others, that from a single ascent or descent, likewise all the
descents and ascents can be determined. For with the other resistances that we have used
here, the operation does not succeed, nor can an equation be deduced from which the
indeterminates can be separated from each other. On this account the use of a constant
resistance is the most simple, and next follows that in which the resistance is proportional
to the squares of the speed, and thus after this, the simplest resistance to be had is that in
the ratio of the fourth power of the speeds. Indeed it is seen from these that little of
convenience is to be obtained for the motion, by defining the resistance according to this
hypothesis, since one descent is taken as given, which moreover is found with as much
difficulty as any another. But if more descents are considered and compared with each
other, the equation
2
dv = − gdx + v ds
2
k
itself implies three variables, clearly besides v and s or x, the speed at the point C which
changes in different descents. Whereby with the resolution of this equation we are led
back to the other equation
2
du = − gdx + u ds
2 ,
k
which is observed for one descent, that was inconveniently carried out by the three
variables in that manner. Besides with the help of that art, more descents can be
compared with each other, which indeed under other hypothesis of the resistance cannot
happen. And hence also many inverse problems under this hypothesis of the resistance
can be resolved, which are unable to be treated in all the others. [p. 328]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

613. If the resistance were taken as very small with respect to the force acting and
proportional to some power of the speeds, to determine the motion of the body on some
curve AM (Fig.68).
Solution.
The body descends on the curve AM with the start of the descent
being from A ; the abscissa AP = x is put on the vertical axis, the
arc AM = s , and the force always pulling downwards is equal to g.
Let the speed at M correspond to the height v, and the resistance at
m
that place is equal to v m , thus so that the resistance is proportional
k
to the 2m th power of the speed. With these in place, the [governing
equation] is :

as CD = a, the abscissa CP = x and the arc CM = s; with which put in place this case is
reduced to the above, if a – x is put in place of x and – ds in place of ds. Whereby if the
height corresponding to the speed at M is called v, then
as an approximation. Now these integrals are to be taken, so that they vanish on putting
x = a. And the time to travel along the arc EM is equal to
as an approximation, where again all the integrals are thus to be taken so that they vanish
on putting x = a. [p. 330] In a similar manner, if the body from C on the curve CME
ascends with such a speed, that it is able to reach as far as the point E, the same equations
are in place, only if in place of k m there is put − k m . Hence on this account it becomes :
and the time of the descent along ME is approximately equal to :
with all these integrals taken thus, so that they vanish on putting x = a. And in this
manner both the descents and the oscillations of the body on any suitable curve in the
rarest medium can be determined. Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.
614. It is apparent from these, as indeed it is understood by itself, if the body descends in
some medium with resistance on the curve AM (Fig. 68), that the speed of the body at M
is less than if the body descends along the same curve in vacuo. And the time in the
resisting medium is more than the time the time of descent along AM in vacuo.
Corollary 2.
615. The height corresponding to the speed at the point C (Fig. 67) is produced, if
x = 0 is put in the expression for v. But with this done it becomes
as an approximation with the above prescribed method of action x = 0 put in place after
the integration. [p. 331] But if (a − x) m ds is thus taken, so that it vanishes on putting

x = 0, then at the point C there is :
if after the integration there is put x = a. Since that pertains to the descent.

616. But for the ascent the speed of the body at C, by which it prevails to ascend as far as
E, must correspond to a height equal to
if this integral is thus taken, so that it vanishes on putting x = 0, and after the integration
there is put x = a. [Euler's quaint way of describing definite integrals.]
Corollary 4.
617. Let the height corresponding to the speed of the body at C = b, as now it has
acquired by descending along EMC and which ascends again on the same curve; the
height DC from the descent traversed is put as before as a and the height to which by the
ascent it reaches, a – d ; then d is a very small quantity and thus

618. Because the time for the descent along EM is equal to

body on a given curve, I progress to the inverse questions, in which from these quantities
given, these which are unknown are investigated. And indeed at first problems of this
kind occur, in which the law of the acceleration or the scale of the speeds is given and the
curve is sought, which the motion of that scale agreed upon is produced in a medium with
some kind of resistance; now we assume the absolute force as constant and acting

621. In a medium which resists in the ratio of some power of the speeds, to find the curve
AM (Fig.69), upon which the body thus descends, so that at the individual points M it has
a speed corresponding to the height, which is equal to the corresponding applied line
PL of the given curve BL.
Solution.
On putting AP = x and PL = v the equation is given between x and v on account of
the given curve BL. Now let the arc AM = s and the
exponent of the ratio of the multiple of the speeds be
equal to2m, to which the resistance is proportional ;
with which put in place, there arises :
m
dv = gdx − v mds ,
k
with g denoting the uniform force pulling downwards
and k the exponent of the resistance. Therefore from
this equation it is found that
ds =
gk m dx − k m dv
,
vm
which, since v can be given in terms of x, the equation has the variables separated from
each other and thus it is sufficient to construct the curve AM sought. But since ds must
always be greater than dx, lest the curve AM becomes imaginary, it is required that [p.

there the curve AM is unable to have any part. Q.E.I.

622. Since, where the tangent to the curve BL is vertical, is the case that dv = 0, then in
the corresponding place to the curve AM
ds =
gk m dx
,
vm
in which point the body descending has either a maximum or minimum speed. Therefore
lest this point of the curve AM is imaginary, it is necessary that ak m > v m or v < k m g .
Corollary 2.
623. If the curve BL is incident at some point on the axis AP, so that v = 0 there, then in
the corresponding place of the curve AM, it is the case that ds =∝ , if indeed m is a
positive number. Therefore in this place the curve AM has a horizontal tangent, in which
the curve comes to an end.
Corollary 3.
624. The curve AM can have a horizontal tangent somewhere ; in this place dx can
vanish before ds. On this account it becomes :
ds = − k mdv . [p. 335]

From which it appears that in place of the curve BL with the corresponding applied line
must decrease and there the tangent to the curve BL is horizontal, since dv is also
infinitely greater than dx.

Therefore in order that the curve at the beginning A, where the speed is zero, has a
vertical tangent, it is necessary there that dv = gdx or v = gx. Therefore in this case the
tangent of the angle, that the curve BL at A makes with AP, is equal to g.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Scholion 1. [p. 336]
627. If the curve BL rises above AB, then the curve AM also inclines upwards and in
place of the descent, for the problem can satisfy the ascent upon that curve. Thus indeed
in this case let the abscissa x be negative and let the element of this is be dx; on which
account we have this equation :
ds =
− gk m dx − k m dv

vm
which arises from the equation :
m

from containing the nature of the ascent. In a similar manner, if the curve BL thus has
been compared, so that it ascends again, then the curve AM also is directed up and
satisfies the prescribed condition by partially descending and partially rising.
Example 1.
628. If the curve AM is sought, upon which the body is moving uniformly, with a speed
clearly corresponding to the height b, then BL is a straight line parallel to the axis AP and
v = b. On this account,
ds =
gk m dx
.
bm
Thus it follows that the line AM is a straight inclined line and the cosine of the angle, that
m
it makes with the vertical AP, is equal to b m with 1 put for the whole sine. Therefore so
gk
that the greater b or the speed shall be, by which the body is to be carries, for that less
will be the angle with the vertical AP, and if it should be that b m = gk m , then the line
sought is the vertical AP itself. But if b m is put in place greater than gk m , then the
solution is lead to being imaginary, clearly to an angle of which the cosine is greater thanEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

descending, is equal to

Example 2. [p. 337]
629. The curve AM is sought, upon which the body thus descends, so that its speed at
individual points is in the ratio of the square root from the height AP, which is the
property agreeing for all motion in vacuo. Therefore we have v = αx and dv = αdx and
with these substituted there is obtained :
ds =
( g −α ) k m x1−m
gk m dx −αk m dx
and
s
=
α m xm
(1− m)α m
,
where there is no need to add a constant, if m < 1. But if m = 1, the curve is a tractrix on
the line described to the horizontal passing through A ; upon which the descent begins
from an infinite distance clearly by drawing together with the asymptote. In a similar
manner, if m > 1, the curve has a form similar to the tractrix.
[The tractrix is the curve described by a body dragged along a rough horizontal plane,
attached to the end of a massless string of constant length, the other end of which moves
along a straight line at a constant speed. It is the evolute of the catenary. One parametric
form of the curve is : See e.g. Lockwood, A Book of Curves, p. 124, for some of the
history of this curve; or one of the websites that delves into such things.]
Moreover it is always necessary that α < g ; from which it is evident that the body in the
resisting medium is not able to acquire as much speed as in a vacuum. Then since ds
must be greater than dx, it follows that ( g − α )k m > α m x m ; therefore the body is unable to
descent further than through the distance equal to αk m ( g − α ) ; in which place the tangent
to the curve is vertical and the curve has the point of reversion. Moreover the time, in
which the body descends along the arc AM , is equal to :
[p. 338] Whereby unless m < 12 , the time cannot be finite, but is of infinite size; for if
m = 12 , the curve is a cycloid pointing downwards, upon the vertex A of which the body
remains for ever.
Corollary 6.
630. Therefore it is evident in a resisting medium that the motion cannot be continued
beyond a given point, thus in order that the speeds are always in the square root ratio of
the heights.
Corollary 7.
631. From these it is apparent that all the curves found in this way have a horizontal
tangent at A. Hence as long as the radius of osculation at A is of finite magnitude, the
body never descends. But if the radius of osculation becomes infinitely small, which
eventuates if m < 12 , then the body can descend; from which it is understood that the time
is finite.


Scholium 2.

632. If the body starts to descend from A and the tangent to the curve AM at A is not
horizontal, then the initial resistance of the motion is zero; hence there dv = gdx. On
which account at the place where the curve AM is produced does not have a horizontal
tangent at A, p. 339] the curve BL, which at A agrees with AP, thus has to be prepared, so
that it is given initially by v = gx ; or the tangent of the curve BL at A must make an
angle with the axis AP, the tangent of which is equal to g; indeed otherwise the curve
AM cannot make an acute angle with AP. But on descending more, it is always the case
that v < gx; for in a resisting medium the speed acquires from any height is less than the
speed that it acquires from the same height in vacuo. Again in a resisting medium the
body cannot acquire a greater speed than if it were dropped vertically; since indeed a
vertical line is the shortest and fastest by which the descent is completed, as the body is
exposed to the least action of the resistance. On this account in a resisting medium the
curve BL thus must be prepared, so that everywhere v is less than the height
corresponding to the speed that is acquired by a body falling through the same resistive
medium along AP. For where v surpasses this height, there the curve AM is imaginary.

Scholium 3.

633. In like manner the situation arises, if the curve BLD
(Fig. 70) is given for the ascent, the applied lines of which
PL are the heights corresponding to the speeds upon the
curve to be found AME at the points M. For on calling AP =
x, PL = v and AM = s then there arises
ds =
− gk m dx − k m dv
.

Therefore lest ds is negative, it is necessary that dv has a
negative value [p. 340], i. e. in order that the curve BL continuously converges to the axis
AD. For then – dv must be greater than gdx or the tangent of the curve BL everywhere
must make a greater angle with the axis AP than is that angle, the tangent of which is
m
equal to g. Nor truly does this suffice, but also –dv –gdx must be greater than v mdx or

or the difference between –dv and gdx must be greater than v mdx . Here this last
k
condition is returned in the form, that PL is less than the height corresponding to the
speed that the body has at P, if from A with a speed corresponding to the height AB it
could ascend to AP. For in the ascent along the vertical line by reason of the height
traversed, the body suffers the smallest decrease of speed from the resistance. Moreover
at the point D the angle ADB has to be of such a size, that the tangent of this is equal to g,
since near the point E, at which the speed is zero, the effect of the resistance vanishes; but
now if this angle should be greater, then the curve AME has a horizontal tangent at E, as
we cautioned in the preceding scholium regarding the descent.

PROPOSITION 72. Problem

634. If the curve AM (Fig.71) is given, upon which the body is moving in vacuo, to find
the curve am, upon which the body moves in a medium with resistance thus descends, so
that the speed at a is equal to the speed at A and with equal arcs AM and am taken, so
that the speeds at individual points M and m are also equal.

Solution.

With the vertical axes AP and ap drawn, and with the horizontal lines MP, mp let AM
= am = s, AP = t and ap = x; the given curve AM
is given by means of the equation between s et t.
Now the speeds at the points A and a correspond to
the height b and the speeds at M and m correspond
to the height v. Let the absolute force acting
downwards be g and the resistance as the 2mth
power of the speeds. With these put in place, then
for the motion in vacuo upon the curve AM:
dv = – gdt or v = b – gt
and with the descent in the resisting medium upon the curve ma :
m
dv = − gdx + v mds ;
k
in which equation if in place of dv and v there are substituted values found from the
previous equation, there is produced :
− gdt = − gdx +
(b − gt ) m ds
(b − gt ) m ds
or dx = dt +
.

gk m
Since moreover the equation is given between t and s, if in place of t the value of this in
terms of s is substituted, the equation is obtained between x and s for the curve sought
am. Q.E.I.

Corollary 1. [p. 342]

635. If on the curve AM the point B is the start of the descent and thus the height of this
above A = bg , there is also obtained the start of the descent b on the curve am, on taking
the arc amb = AMB.

Corollary 2.

636. From the solution it is apparent that dx > dt always; whereby the height ap is
greater than the height AP; for in the medium with the resistance there is a need for more
height to generate the same speed as in vacuo.

Corollary 3.

637. Because on the curves AM and am taken with equal arcs the speeds at these places
are the same, the times too are equal, in which the equal arcs AM et am are described.
And thus the time of the descent in the medium with resistance along bma is equal to the
time of the descent in vacuo along BMA.
Corollary 4.
638. Lest the curve bma becomes imaginary, it is necessary that everywhere dx < ds.
On this account it is necessary that :
dt +
(b − gt ) m ds
< ds or gk m dt < gk m ds − (b − gt ) m ds .
gk m
Moreover this is thus obtained, if it is the case that [p. 343]
gk m dt < (gk m − b m )ds ,
which is so if t vanishes and [the inequality] pertains to the point a, unless t has a
negative value somewhere. Concerning this it is only required to be considered that the
point a is made real, which comes about if gkmdt is not greater than ( gk m − b m )ds .
Corollary 5.
639. Therefore lest the curve am becomes imaginary, before everything it is necessary
that b < k m g . At the point A, let ds = αdt ; α is a number greater than one, and thus
gk m < α (gk m − b m )ds or b < k m
g (α −1)
α
.
Therefore if the curve MA in A has a horizontal tangent, it must be the case that
b < k m g on account of α =∝ .
Corollary 6.
640. Moreover, if ds = αdt at the point A, let b m =g ( α −1 )
( α −1 )ds= ds .

Therefore in this case the curve am has a vertical tangent at a.

Corollary 7.

641. At the start of the motion at B let b = gt or t = bg . Therefore for the point b, dx = dt
with the elements of the curves taken equal. Whereby the tangents at the points B and b
are equally inclined.

Scholion 1. [p. 344]

642. Since it is not possible to completely construct the curve am from the curve AM, for
besides it is necessary to know the speed at the point A or at the start of the descent B, if
another starting point of the descent is taken on the curve AM then another curve am is
found. Therefore for this reason the curves BMA and bma are thus only in agreement for
a single descent, in order that the speeds in which the intervals are traversed are equal to
each other, and if the starts of the descents are placed at other points, then this agreement
is no longer in place. Therefore two curves are not given, upon which all the descents as
far as to a given point are in agreement with each other, the one in vacuo, and the other
placed in a resisting medium.
Example 1.
643. Let AMB be a straight line inclined at some inclination, thus so that s = αt , and the
curve amb is sought, upon which the body in a like manner is progressing in a resisting
medium upon as the above AMB in vacuo. Moreover in putting αs in place of t, the
following equation is produced between x and s for the curve sought amb :
and the integral of this is :
[p. 345] Lest the point a becomes imaginary, it is necessary that :
1 + bm < 1 .
α gk m
For if it happens that
bm =
(α −1) gk m
,
α
then the curve has a vertical tangent at a nor therefore can b have a greater value.
Therefore the body can put on the inclined line BMA to descend from such a height, as
it becomes :
b = km

;
then the equation becomes :
which is the equation for the curve amb, at which the start of the descent is taken from b,
where ds = αdx , or the arc amb is equal to:

g m−1

If the resistance were proportional to the squares of the speeds, then m = 1 and thusEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

and on integrating :
x = s − 2ss

αk
Which is the equation for a cycloid described on a horizontal base, the diameter of the
generating circle of which is α2k .

Corollary 8.

644. Therefore let the cycloid AMB be described on the horizontal base CB (Fig. 72) by
the generating circle ANC, and let the medium be resisting in the ratio of the square of the
speeds, the exponent of which is equal to k. If now in the circle ANC the chord AN = k2 is
taken, and the horizontal PNM is drawn and from M the tangent MT and the two bodies
are placed to descend, the one on MT in vacuo and the other on the curve MB in the
resisting medium, both these bodies complete equal distances in equal times. [p. 346]

Example 2.

645. Let AMB (Fig. 71) be a cycloid considered downwards, the diameter of the
generating circle of which is α2 ; then we have ss =2at , t = 2ssa and dt = sds
. Hence with
a
these substituted there is produced the following equation for the curve amb :
or if the whole arc AMB, which in vacuo is put for the completed descent, is called c, then
gcc
b = 2a and thus for the curve amb this equation arises :

Therefore lest this curve becomes imaginary at the point a, it is necessary that
g m−1 < 2m a m k m or the height of the arc AB must be less than kg m g ; for if the height of
the arc AB = kg m g , then the tangent of the curve amb is vertical at b. Therefore if B is
the cusp of the cycloid, then 2cca = a2 or c = a, and if in addition g m−1 a m = 2 m k m , in order
that the tangent of the curve amb becomes vertical at a, this equation is obtained :
which curve has vertical tangents at a and b.
Corollary 9. [p. 347]
646. Therefore when the body thus descends on the cycloid, in order that the
accelerations of this body are proportional to the distances traversed, then descents on the
curve amb in the resisting medium have the same the same property in place, if the start
of the descent is taken at the point b, that is determined through the equation to the curve
amb; clearly it is amb = c.

Corollary 10.

647. If another starting point is taken at B on the curve AMB, another whole curve amb is
found, since the length of the arc AMB = c is contained in the equation of this. Whereby,
even if the cycloid is a tautochronous curve in vacuo, yet such a curve amb is not [a
tautochrone] in a medium with resistance, since for several descents on the same curve
AMB as many different curves correspond in the resisting medium.

Scholium 2.

648. In this example the curves have been elicited that the Cel. Hermann in Comm. Book
II found for tautochrones in resisting mediums [Jacob Hermann, General theory of the
motion that arises with forces acting constantly on bodies. Commen. acad. sc. Petrop. 2
(1727), 1729, p. 139]; but likewise he has shown that it is not possible to give a
satisfactory answer to the question. Furthermore from these is understood, in a like
manner, that it is possible to find in a curve in a resisting medium, upon which a body on
ascending is moving in the same way as that on a given curve in vacuo. [p. 348] For A
and a are the initial points of the ascent, that one in vacuo, and this in a resisting medium,
and let the initial speed correspond to the height b; this equation is obtained for the curve
amb :
from which equation it is understood that the curve amb does not become imaginary,
unless the curve itself AMB were such. For because, lest the curve amb is imaginary, it
must be that dx < ds, here dx is less than dt, that per se must be less than ds. As if the line

AMB is a vertical line, the other amb is possible to be assigned; for on putting AB = c
then b = gc and s = t; wherefore for the curve amb this equation is found :
the integral of which is :
This equation can be adapted to resistance proportional to the square of the speed; let
m = 1 and thus
which is related to the cycloid in this way: the cycloid AMB (Fig.72) is described with the
generating circle of diameter AC = k2 upon the horizontal base BC; then the arc
AM = k – c is taken; then M is the start of the ascent, from which point, if the body
ascends on the curve MA with a speed corresponding to the height gc, in the medium
resisting as the square ratio of the speeds, the body is moving in the same way as in
vacuo with the same initial speed, rising vertically up.
