THE MOTION OF A POINT ON A GIVEN LINE IN A VACUUM.

## PROPOSITION 36. Problem.

328. With a uniform force g acting downwards everywhere, to find all the curves AMC
(Fig. 41), upon which a body descends from rest at A in a given time to a straight line BC
inclined at any angle to the horizontal. .

Solution.

The applied line BD of the curve AND
expresses the time, in which the body from A
reaches the line straight BC, and from any
point M the straight line MQ is drawn parallel
to the given line BC, on cutting the vertical AB
at Q, and QN expresses the time in which the
body has traversed the part AM . Whereby, if
an infinitude of curves AND are considered,
which all have the same applied line BD at B,
all these generate curves AMC, upon which the
body in the given time arrives at BC from A.
Moreover the curves AND, as advised above,
must concur at A with the vertical AB and as far
as D must diverge from AB. Now putting the tangent of the angle ABC = k, and putting
y
y
AP = x, PM = y, AQ = u, QN = t and AB = a; then PQ = k and thus x + k = u .
Moreover since the speed at M must correspond to the height gx, the time to traverse AM

dt =
( dx 2 + dy 2 )

, which has to be equal to QN = t ; therefore we have exactly
( dx 2 + dy 2 )

and gxdt 2 = dx 2 + dy 2 . But on account of the given curve AND, t is
y
given in terms of u, and since u is given by u = x + k , t is given by x and y ; on accountEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

of which the equation is obtained between x and y for the curve sought AMC. Or since
we have y = ku − kx , then the equation becomes :
gxdt 2 = ( k 2 + 1 )dx 2 − 2k 2dudx + k 2du 2
and [p. 152] it is allowed to find x in terms of u . In order to do this, let dt = pdu , [i.e. p is
the gradient of the AND curve with the abscissa u vertical] then
gxp 2du 2 = ( k 2 + 1 )dx 2 − 2k 2dudx + k 2du 2
and
dx =
k 2 du ± (( g ( k 2 +1 ) p 2 x − k 2 )du 2 )
.

Therefore the curve AND must be taken everywhere such that [the gradient] p is greater

than

0 it becomes x = 0. With which done, the equation between x and y for the curve sought
can be obtained. Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.
329. The curve AMC is a tangent to the straight line AB at A, if dy = 0 on putting x = 0;
now it must then be the case that du = dx and 1 = ( g ( k 2 + 1 ) p 2 x − k 2 ) . Whereby this
comes about, if on making ppx = 1g on making x = 0. Moreover since in this case y is
infinitely smaller than x, in the beginning x = u; from which it follows that the curve
AMC is a tangent to the vertical AB at A, if ppu = 1g with u = 0. [Note that this
degenerates to the equation dx = gdt 2 in the neighbourhood of A, on setting du = dx,
recognisable as an equation of motion; the customery 12 is missing as usual, as all such
expressions involving free fall are compared against each other by Euler, rather than dealt
with in an absolute manner, which could not be done at the time, due to the lack of an
adequate set of units. The reader has no doubt observed that two curves are always used
in these demonstrations : AND is the vertical displacement x versus time t, while AMD is
the vertical displacement x versus horizontal displacement y. ]

For the remaining cases, since C is now an arbitrary quantity, from one curve AND
innumerable curves AMC can be found.
Again the single case has to be treated on its own, if A = B or

335. In this example two cases occur in which α = 1 ; indeed in the first in turn only the
vertical line satisfying the problem has been found, and in the other besides this line the
other inclined straight line has been found, yet we have used both in the same way in the
general equation. Moreover now more often cases of this kind are touched upon, in which
the differential equations contain amongst themselves the integral equations, which
nevertheless cannot be expressed by integration. As in the case α = 1 , this has the
differential equation
which on integration gives x = u. Yet meanwhile it is evident that this equation
k 2u = ( k 2 + 1 )x is contained in that too, even if it cannot be produced by integration.
And on this account the equation is equally satisfied by the latter integral as the former
x = u. Hence it is permitted generally to gather together the differential equation into the
form
dt = Vdu ,
T
in which T is such a function of t, which vanishes on putting t = 0, and V is some function
of u, equally understood that this integration vanishes when t = 0 and this [p. 156]

is is elicited by integration. Indeed generally the case t = 0 can be disregarded if t a
simple quantity; but if t is a composit quantity as in our case, it is wrongly omitted. We
had a similar case above (300) in the equation
where we observed the equation x = a to be contained in that, even if it could not be
integrated by integration. For on putting a − x = t then − dx = dt and
is a function of t, which becomes equal to zero, if we make t = 0 or x = a; in as much as
Pdx is thus prescribed to be accepted, so that it vanishes on putting x = a. Hence on

putting this function of t equal to T the equation becomes ds = dtT b , hence in which
equation it is allowed to conclude without risk that the equation t = 0 or x = a is satisfied,EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Hence it is understood that T = 0 is contained in the proposed equation Vdu = dt

hence, if t should be a composite quantity for argument's sake from u and x, then the
equation of the integral is not likely to be had at once by integration.

336. Here the case remains, which requires a particular resolution, [p. 157] when the
straight line BC meets the line BA above the point A, and when it is parallel. But we
consider only the case in the following problem, in which BC is made parallel to the
vertical line AB and put at a given distance ; from which in a similar manner the case of
the line inclined at some angle can be deduced.

Problem.
341. Let the body always be acted on by a uniform downwards force g and any curve is
given BSC (Fig. 43) ; to find all the curves AMC, upon which the body by descending
from A in a given time arrives at the given curve BSC.
Solution.
Let any of the given curves sought be AMC, through some point M of this, the curve
MQ similar to the [known]curve BSC with respect to the fixed point A is drawn, and the
applied line NQ expresses the time for the arc AM of the curve AND to be completed;
hence the applied line BD sets out the time for the whole curve AMC to be completed.
With which done, the curve AMC can be found in turn from the given curve AND.
Whereby if an infinity of curves AND is considered, which all have the common line of
application BD at B, these generate the infinity of curves AMC, upon all of which the
body arrives at the curve BSC by descending from A in the given time. If now
AB = a, BD = b and for the arc QM a similar arc BS is cut off from the given curve
BSC; then we have :
AQ : AB = PM : RS = AP : AR = PQ : BR. [p. 161]
Again putting AP = x , PM = y , AQ = u , QN = t , AR = r , RS = s; on account of the given
curve BSC there is an equation given between r and s and on account of the given curve

Then the speed of the body at M corresponds to the height gx, from which the time to
pass along AM is equal to :
∫
( dx 2 + dy 2 )
gx
,
that must be put equal to t; hence this equation arises gxdt 2 = dx 2 + dy 2 .
Moreover since t is given through u, let dt = pdu and p is a function of u; and because
dx = udr +a rdu and dy = uds +a sdu
this equation goes over into this :
garup 2du 2 = ( udr + rdu )2 + ( uds + sdu )2
But since the curve BSC is given, then s is a function of r and it becomes ds = qdr with q
present some function of r. With these put in place, an equation is obtained between u
and r:
garup 2du 2 = ( udr + rdu )2 + ( uqdr + sdu )2
Which with the square root extracted gives :
From which if the equation between r and u can be found, then likewise the equation
between x and y for the curve sought is obtained.
Moreover since it is restricted to the curve AND, let P be some function of u and thus
Pdu integrated, so that it vanishes on making u = 0 and it becomes equal to A on puttng

u = a; then we can take t =

where any allowed function of u can be put in place for the function P. Q.E.I.
Corollary 1. [p. 162]
342. If u is put equal to 0, for that both x and y vanish, unless perhaps r or s become
infinite. Therefore in that case in the integration of differential equation some constant
found can be added, since there is no need that r should have a given value, if u is made
equal to 0.
Corollary 2.
343. Therefore then on account of the arbitrary constant to be added, from one given
curve AND, innumerable curves AMC can be found satisfying what is sought.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Corollary 3.
344. If the curve BSC has thus been prepared, so that neither r nor s is able to become
infinitely great, an infinite number of curves sought AMC are given always from a single
curve AND. Not only do they have this property so that bodies descending on these arrive
at the same time at the given line BSC, but also likewise they can reach any given similar
curve QM .
Corollary 4.
345. Therefore since in the integration of the equation found it is allowed to add some
constant[p. 163], thus that can always be assumed, so that the curve AMC is directed
towards a given point C of the given BSC. And in this way an infinite number of curves
AMC can be found, which all come together at a given point C.
Scholium 1.
346. We have put the curves QM similar to the curve BSC, so that curve itself raised to
A becomes infinitely small and all the points of the curve BSC come together at A and
both x and y vanish on putting u = 0. Moreover in the same manner we have put the
curves QM either to be congruent with BSC, or disagreeing according to some condition.
As Q is some function of u vanishing on setting u = 0 and that goes into B on making
u = a, the curve QM thus is able to depend on the curve BSC, so that it becomes
Qr
Qs
x = B et y = B ;
in as much as on making u = a the curve QM is changed into BSC itself and at A the
curve is changed into the point, unless the curve BSC should become infinite. But also in
this case a funtion can be accepted for Q, in order that, even if on making r =∝ , yet Qr
and Qs become equal to 0, if u = 0. Moreover on putting dQ = Vdu the following general
equation is obtained :
Which equation appears to be the most wide, and from a single curve AND an infinite
number of curves AMC can be furnished, and it can also be supposed that an infinite
number of curves pass through the point C.
Scholium 2. [p. 164]
347. Moreover, however general this equation is, yet the curve QM is similar to the curve
BSC, since it satisfies x : y = r : s. Whereby thus the more general solution can be
shown, in which curves QM dissimilar in some manner can be put in place of the curve
BSC, yet of the same kind, such that QM becomes BSC on making u = a. Now this
solution is obtained, if some function R of u is taken vanishing on making u = 0 and R is
evaluated at D on putting u = a, and it is given by dR = Wdu. Indeed takingEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

the equation is obtained between u and x. But it should be noted, since Q vanishes on
making u = 0, then P must be such a function of u that P 2Q , on putting u = 0, either

lest Pdu on being assumed in this manner, becomes infinitely great.

completed by descending in the same time, clearly in that time in which the chords of the

chord AM is traversed. Whereby this curve has the property that any arc AM is completed

357. From the general solution of this problem, when a single curve AND gives an
infinity of curves AMC, it is allowed to collect the solution of this problem, when an
infinity of curves are required[p. 170] on all of which the body arrives at a given point
from A. Indeed some curve AND gives a single curve crossing through a given point of
the curve BSC and in this way innumerable curves of this kind are found. But when the
solution in this manner should be exceedingly difficult and laborious, it is agreed that
another more fundamental method should be produced. But the manner in which we use
this is thus prepared, so that it is necessary to know one curve, from which we show how
to deduce innumerable other curves. Therefore this curve, which must be known, is
elicited from one method of treatment, as from (350), where the curve can be found
crossing through some point of the semicircle in a time to be described.

358. Let the body be acted on always by a uniform force g downwards and let the curve
AMC (Fig. 45) be given, upon which the body released from A arrives at some given
point C; to find all the curves ANC upon which the body in the same time descends in the
same time to the point C from A.
Solution.
With the vertical line AB taken for the
axis of all the curves, let the abscissa of
the given curve AMC be AP = t, with the
applied line PM = u and let the curve
ANC be one of the sought curves ; in that
the arc AN is taken, [p. 171] which is
completed in the same time as the arc
AM; the points M and N are joined by the
straight line MN and the curve ALB is
constructed such that the applied line PL
is equal to the line MN. Hence this curve
ALB crosses the axis AB at the points A
and B; for with the point M falling on A the point N also falls on A and on putting M at C
the point N is also at C, since the arcs AMC and ANC are put to be transversed in the
same time. Moreover, it is understood from the curve ALB that it is possible to find the
curve ANC; whereby if an infinitude of curves of this kind ALB are considered at A and B
coinciding with AB, a certain one of these gives the curve ANC and in this manner an
innumerable number of curves ANC satisfying the question are produced. Now let PL =
r; then r is some function of AP = t; moreover putting the abscissa of the curve ANC, AQ
= x and QN = y. With these in place we have :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

page 255
MN = (( x − t )2 + ( u − y )2 ) = r and thus y = u ± ( r 2 − ( x − t )2 ) .
Again, since the time for AM is put equal to the time for AN, there arises
or
xdt 2 + xdu 2 = tdx 2 + tdy 2 .
But
Let du = pdt and dr = qdt ; where r, p and q are functions of t; again for brevity put
x − t = z or x = t + z ; then the equation arises :
and
Hence this equation is obtained :
from which z and t can be determined ; an equation can be obtained between x and y. [p.
172] Moreover where it is apparent, a function of t of this kind ought to be accepted in
place of r, so that r vanishes on putting t = 0 since t = AB = a, let P be some function of t
vanishing on putting t = 0 and Q is also such a function vanishing on putting t = 0; Now
Q can be changed at A, if on making t = a; it is hence able to put r = P( A − Q ). And with
this value whatever substituted in place of P and Q, the equation for the curve sought is
obtained. Q.E.I.

359. Indeed from this equation it can be concluded that it is a little complex to be
resolved, even if it is considered to be fundamental. Moreover often the equation found
must be reductio ad absurdum, if the curve given AMC were the line of shortest descent,
in which case it is not possible to give other curves, upon which the descent can be made
in the same time. Therefore it is seen to be in agreement with our intention that the lines
of quickest descent are to be treated, and this problem resolved, in which between all the
curves either of the same length or having some other common property that is sought the
line which is completed in the minimum time; and also as between all the lines upon
which the descent is made in the same time, that line is to be found, which has some
given property provided. For even if it is most difficult, all the lines having the same timeEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

possesses before all the rest. Moreover in order to carry out this program, it is required to
deal with the method of isoperimetrics, that as it is set out everywhere, we will not

360. Moreover the solution of this problem is obtained in the following manner by(348).
There it was found that :
Let C be the point(Fig. 43), at which it is agreed that all the curves must meet, and put
AE = f and EC = h ; if therefore on putting r = f, then it is also the case that s = h.
According to this, let S be some function of r, which goes over into F on putting r = f,
. This value is substituted into the above equation and that is
with which done, put s = Sh

thus integrated, so that on putting u = a , it gives r = f. Then from that equation there is
produced an equation between the coordinates of the curve AMC sought, clearly AP = x

Problem.
361. To find the general rule, following which a curve ought to be disposed, in order that
a body descending on that curve arrives at any point on the curve in the shortest possible
time.
Solution.
Let AMC (Fig. 45) be a curve of this
kind, upon which a body arrives at C from
A in a shorter time than on any other curve
crossing from A to C. Therefore for any two
point M and μ between these, the curve
intercepted must be compared, in order that
its motion along the arc AMC is completed
in a shorter time than any other, if it should
be intercepted. Now the nearby points M
and μ are joined by the two elements
Mm, mμ , and the time to pass through
Mmμ is a minimum, or by the rules of the
method of maxima and minima, equal to the
time for the nearby elements Mn, nμ . [p.
175] The applied lines MP, mp, and μπ are
drawn to the axis AP and with the elements Pp, p π equal to each, or also MG = mH and
pm, if there is a need, is produced to n and mn in made infinitely small with respect to the
elements Mm and nμ . Therefore it must be :
t .Mm + t .mμ = t .Mn + t .nμ .
[The time to traverse the elements Mm and mμ is equal to the time to traverse the
infinitesimally close elements Mn and nμ , the condition for the time variable to be a
stationary point w.r.t. the independent variable x, for which Pp = pπ = dx. Meanwhile
the curve is described at these points M , m , and μ by y , y + dy , and y + dy + ddy ]
Let the speed that the body has at M correspond to the height v, with which therefore both
the elements Mm and Mn are traversed. Moreover the speed that the body has at m,
corresponds to the height v + du and the speed that it has at n, corresponds to the
height v + du + ddw [note that du includes contributions from the vertical force, as well as
from a general horizontal force and some tangential force acting along the curve; the final
speed includes second order contributions from the horizontal and tangential forces, as
we are shown eventually in the corollaries. Recall that in Euler's analysis, an increment
is always added at the start of an element, and holds a constant value within theEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

increment : thus, the speed at M corresponds to v throughout Mm, the speed at m
corresponds to v + du, and is held constant throughout mμ , etc]; moreover with that
[former] speed the element mμ is traversed, as now with this [latter] speed so the
element nμ is traversed. Hence therefore this equation is obtained :

hence with the centres M and μ and with the arclets mg and nh drawn, there arises :

362. Therefore, if the lengths are called :
then
With these substituted, there is obtained :
In which, if from the forces acting v, du, and ddw can be determined, and the equation for
the brachystochrone curve can be obtained. But always ddw thus involves mn, as from the
calculation it exceeds mn.

Scholium 1.
365. From the solution, it is understood that the formula found extends the widest and can
be extended to any forces acting, and also including resistance. For whatever forces
should be acting, so du as well as ddw can be determined, and which values put in place
gives the equation for the brachystochrone sought. But yet these are only in place, if the
directions of the forces are in the same plane; for the curve found is situated in the same
plane. Yet no less, if the forces should not be acting in the same plane, a brachystochrone
curve can be found in a given plane with the help of this formula. Indeed in any given
particular plane it pleases, a brachystochrone curve is given, whatever the forces acting
should be. Now the other question is, if a brachystochrone curve is sought from among
all the curves joining two given points, also not situated in one given plane. Now as often
as the directions of the forces acting in the same plane are put in place, there is no doubt
that the brachystochrone curve is in the same plane. For if the curves are not in the same
plane, oblique forces are acting and therefore they do not give the body as great an
acceleration as is possible. [p. 178] Therefore from this solution, so the brachystochrone
curve is found completely, if the directions of the forces acting are in the same plane, and
also a brachystochrone is present in a given plane, whatever should be the forces acting.
[However, we understand that the time will be larger for such curves where the forces are
not coplanar.]
Scholium 2.
366. This question about brachystochrone curves or lines of quickest descent was first set
out by the most celebrated Joh. Bernoulli [actually Leibniz and Jas. Bernoulli] and many
solutions of this are extant, as in the Act. Lips., so also in the English Transactions, and in
the Comm. Acad. Paris, and in others, where the solution for this problem, under the
hypothesis of forces acting directed downwards and for centripetal forces, have been
given. But no one has solved the fundamental problem that we have given here, set out so
widely, so that it can also be extended to include forces of any kind, as well as resistance.
For all have supposed that ddw = 0 , because that is always wrong, unless the direction of
the force is MG or mH. And the most celebrated Hermann stumbled over this, while he
used such a proposition in finding the brachystochrones in a resistive medium in theEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Potuissemus autem eodem modo curvas QM vel cum BSC congruentes ponere vel

esset difficilis et operosa, aliam genuinam magis afferre convenit. Modus autem, quo

punctum N quoque erit in C, quia arcus AMC et ANC eodem tempore percurri ponuntur.
Intelligitur autem ex curva ALB inveniri posse curvam ANC; quare si infinitae huiusmodi

Solutio.
Sit AMC (Fig. 45) curva huiusmodi, super qua corpus ex A ad C tempore breviore
perveniat quam supe quavis alia curva per puncta A et C transeunte. Sumtis ergo in ea
duobus quibusque punctis M et μ curva inter ea intercepta ita debet esse comparata, ut
corpus in motu suo per AMC arcum breviore tempore absolvat quam quemvis alium, si
esset interceptus. Sint nunc puncta M et μ proxima iuncta duobus elementis Mm, mμ , et
debebit tempus per Mmμ esse minimum seu per regulas methodi maximorum et
minimorum aequale tempori per elementa proxima Mn, n μ . [p. 175]Ducantur ad axem

Sit celeritas, quam corpus in M habet, debita altitudini v, qua ergo tam elementum Mm
quam Mn percurret. Celeritas autem, quam in m habebit, debita sit altitudini v + du et

potentiae sollicitantes, determinari potest tam du quam ddw, qui valores substituti dabunt
aequationem pro brachystochrona quaesita. Attamen haec tantum locum habent, si
potentiarum directiones sint in eodem plano; curva enim inventa est in eodem plano sita.
Nihilo tamen minus, si potentiae non fuerint in eodem plano, curva brachystochrona in
dato plano ope formulae huius poterit inveniri. In quolibet enim plano dato peculiaris erit
curva brachystochrona, quaecunque fuerint potentiae sollicitantes. Alia vero quaestio est,
si quaeritur linea brachystochrona inter omnes omnino lineas data duo puncta iungentes,
etiam non in uno plano sitas. Quoties vero potentiarum sollicitatium directiones in eodem
plano sunt positae, dubium non est lineam brachystochronam in eodem positam esse
plano. Nam si curvae non essent in eodem plano, potentiae oblique agerent et propterea
corpus non tantum, quantum fieri potest, accelerarent. [p. 178] Ex hac igitur solutione
tam linea absolute brachystochrona, si potentiarum sollicitantium directiones sunt in
eodem plano, invenitur quam linea, quae in dato plano est brachystochrona, quaecunque
