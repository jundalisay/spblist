THE MOTION OF A POINT ON A GIVEN LINE IN A VACUUM

PROPOSITION 49. Problem.

430. If a body is acted on by any forces, to find the curve AM (Fig. 53), upon which all
the descents are made in equal times as far as to the point A.

Solution.

Whatever the forces should be acting, all these can be reduced to two forces, of which
the first now always pulls the body downwards along MQ, and the other pulls the body
horizontally along MP. Let the force which pulls along
MQ be equal to P, and the force which pulls along MP
be equal to Q; call AP = x, PM = y, AM = s ; let the
speed at the point A correspond to the height b, and the
speed at M correspond to the height v. With these in
place, the equation arises v = b − Pdx − Qdy .
∫
Whereby if we put h = b and
∫
∫ Pdx + ∫ Qdy = z , then v
is a function of one dimension of h and z, and therefore
m = 1 (408). On this account, this equation is obtained
for the curve sought :

431. If a curve is obtained, upon which all the descents are made in the same time, it is
easy to give the curves, upon which all the oscillations are performed in the same time.
For since in a vacuum the ascents are similar to the descents, every curve, which is a
tautochrone for the descents is such too for the ascents. Whereby two tautochrone curves
joined at the point A give a curve, upon which all the oscillations are isochrones. But yet
by this reason the other problem, in which all the isochronous oscillations produced are
required, is not perfectly resolved ; for it is possible to give an infinitude of curves
satisfying this question, yet the parts of which are not suited to bringing about isochrones
in the descents alone. Moreover the problem can be proposed in this manner : given any
curve to find another, which joined with that curve produces all oscillations of equal
times. [E012 : De innumerabilibus tautochronis in vacuo, Comment. acad. sc. Petrop. 6
(1729), 1735; O.O. series II, vol. 4] Now before we advance to this problem, we bring
forwards another problem, in which a curve is sought adjoined to a given curve, so that
all the descents on this composite curve are completed in equal times. Which problem has
given me the most difficulty since it was proposed to me by the most celebrated Dan.

this method, which I use in the investigation of tautochrones.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Problem.
432. According to the hypothesis of gravity acting uniformly downwards, if the curve
ANB is given (Fig. 54), to find the curve BMF adjoined to that curve, so that all the
descents upon the composite curve as far as A are completed in equal times, the descent
starting from any point of the curve BMF.
Solution.
If the descent starts from the lowest point B of the curve
sought, the descent is made along the given curve BNA only;
hence the time of that, which is also given, must be equal to the
times of all the descents. Let AD = a, AQ = u, AN = t and the
equation is given between u and t. Moreover, for the curve
sought, let BP = x, and BM = s. Now in any descent, let the
speed at the point B correspond to the height b; the speed at the
point M corresponds to the height b − x and the speed at N
corresponds to the height a + b − u . Therefore the descent time
ds
along the unknown curve is equal to
, thus integrated,
∫ ( b− x )
so that it vanishes on putting x = 0, and on putting x = b in place after the integration.
dt
, thus integrated, so
Now the time along the known curve BNA is given by
∫ ( a + b −u )
that it vanishes on putting u = 0, and putting u = a after the integration. [p. 214]
ds
, after making x = b, must thus be arranged in order
Therefore the expression
∫ ( b− x )
that, if it is added to the expression of the time along BNA, then the letter b is not present
within the sum ; for then the total time of the descent is a constant quantity and does not
depend on b, or on the point of the curve BMF at which the descent started. Let the
dt
, after putting u = a, be equal to this series :
integral
∫ ( a + b −u )
Whereby, if the descent starts from the point B, the time of the whole descent is equal to
k, as b vanishes. Therefore k itself must be equal to the time of the whole descent along
the composite curve, the start of the descent being taken from any point of the curve
BMF. Now let the nature of the curve sought BMF be expressed by the following series :
ds = − Adx x − Bxdx x − Cx 2dx x − Dx3dx x − etc.
− Fdx − Gxdx − Hx 2dx − Ix3dx − etc.
The ratio of the periphery to the diameter is put as π : 1 , which in fact is l − 1 : − − 1,
thus so that it becomes :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Euler came upon this formula for π is still an open question, but here he has at least used
the result to obtain the correct value of an integral, which is highly suggestive.]
Since therefore the time for BNA is equal to k, from the expression of these terms taken
jointly with these other terms, the homogeneous terms involving b must be removed.

the integral is taken thus, so that it vanishes on setting u = 0 [For the time to slide down
AB is the same as the time to slide down the whole curve AB + BM, as the curve is a
tautochrone]; then [after integrating] on making u = a a certain function of b is produced.
Now x( 1 − z ) is put in place of b, and what is produced is to be called R. Then integrate
Rdz , while x is considered as constant, thus as by putting z = 0. Then put z = 1 and a

function of x is produced, which is equal to πs . And in this way an equation is produced

433. Clearly this singular but yet easy construction follows from that method which I
have used in solving a former proposition by C. Riccati, [E 31: Constructio aequationis
differentialis ax n dx = dy + y 2dx , Comment. acad. sc. Petrop. 6 (1732/3), 1738, p. 231;

whatever the curve given should be, that sought can always be constructed with the help
of this method, even if the equation itself, for which the curve is found, often can barely
be handled. Besides it gives at once a finite equation, that otherwise would be found from
the sum of the series.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

434. If in the equation found for the curve BMF , put x = 0, then ds = 2 , hence the
inclination of the curve at B to the vertical BP is known. Since therefore it is apparent
how these two curves touch each other, it is also required to determine the position of the
tangent to the curve ANB at B.
Corollary 2.
435. Let DQ = p and BN = q (Fig. 54) ; then dt = −dq and a − u = p. Hence the time to
traverse BNA is equal to
∫ ( b+ p ) with p = a put in this integral. Let dq = Ldp be the
dq
relation [between p and q] at the point B, and generally it is of the form dq = Ldp + Pdp
with P being a function of p, such that it vanishes on putting p = 0. Therefore we may
consider, with p vanishing, what kind of terms this equation
∫ ( b+ p ) = ∫ ( b+ p ) produces. Moreover on putting p = a it produces :
dq
Ldp
2 L ( b + a ) − 2 L b , [on integrating between 0 and a,] thus in the series taken, at the
beginning it produces the term − 2 L b (436), which agrees with ξ b ; hence this makes

L = − 2 and dq = 2 . From which it is understood that the given curve and that sought
have a common tangent at the joining point B.

terms. [p. 217] Moreover here, only the term Ldp gives a term of this form ξ b .
Whereby from that alone, the inclination of the curve at B can be concluded.

upper curve is fixed meantime], thus so that it vanishes on putting z = 0. Then on putting
z = 1, that which comes about is equal to πs ; and by this arrangement a more convenient

equation is obtained for the curve sought.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

which it follows, if the angle DAB is greater than 600, then x > a, but if that angle is less
than 600, then x < a. Moreover from the differential equation it is required that now as we
have noted at the point B to be ds = ndx, then now always as far as F, to become ds <

Therefore for this reason, if some curve is given, [p. 223] the series of terms of the form

after putting u = b and x = b. [p. 225] Moreover the two first terms of this expression are

clearly they give π f + π h with π denoting the periphery of the circle of which the
diameter is equal to one. Whereby if the later terms are thus to be compared, so that they

447. Therefore on taking AP = u = x (Fig. 56), since AM = t and AN = s, then

Corollary 2. [p. 226]
448. Therefore the curve sought AND thus ought to be compared, so that the sum of the
arcs AM + AN is equal to the arc of the corresponding cycloid for the same abscissa AP.
From which property it follows at once that all the oscillations are isochrones.
Corollary 3.
449. Hence the time of one oscillation is equal to the time of descent on the cycloid, of
which at the bottom the radius of osculation is 2( f + h ) 2 . Or a pendulum of this
length produces the smallest isochronous semi-oscillations by oscillating on the curve
MAN. Now a pendulum of length 12 ( f + h ) 2 performs whole isochronous
oscillations.
Corollary 4.
450. Since the quantity h can be taken as you please, an infinite number of curves AND
can be satisfied, and also h can be determined so that the time of an oscillation is a given
quantity. For if a one oscillation is to be isochronous to the oscillation of a pendulum of
length L4 , then we have :
L = 2( f + h ) 2 and thus h =
L −
2
f .
Where L must be greater than 2f.
Corollary 5.
451. If the given curve AM is a cycloid or dt =
du f
u
, then the other curve AN is also
some cycloid ; [p. 227] for it becomes ds = dx h . And upon the two cycloids of this kind
x
not only are the whole oscillations isochronous, but also the individual ascents and
descents on whatever cycloid is completed in the same time.

equation becomes dt = ndu; and this equation is produced for the curve sought with

454. If therefore it can be brought about that a pendulum can perform oscillations on a
composite curve of this kind, and equally the oscillations of this pendulum are
isochronous, and as if it were moving on a cycloid. And on this account whatever curve
can be used for tautochronism. There remains the question concerning this, as to how the
curve is to be prepared with the given curve, so that it makes one continuous curve with
the given curve, which we set out in the following proposition.

PROPOSITION 52.
Problem.
455. According to hypothesis of uniform gravity acting uniformly downwards, to find the
continuous curve MAN, upon which all the semi-oscillations can be completed in equal
times.
Solution.
Therefore let MAN be the continuous curve (Fig. 56) and on that AP = x, AM = t, and
AN = s. A new indeterminate [i. e. variable] z is assumed, and both x and t are thus given
in terms of z, so that on putting z positive the part AM of the curve is produced, while on
putting z negative the negative part AN is produced. Now since for the other part, x
maintains the same value, x must be such a function of z, which remains the same, if z is
taken either to be positive or negative, or x must be an even function of z. Then t must be
a function of this kind of z, in order that it produces s, if – z is put in place of z. But
since the arc s falls on the other side of the axis, the value of this is negative with respect
to the curve AM; whereby, if in the value t, – z is put in place of z, it must produce – s.
Now let R be an odd function of z and S an even function of z, and put t = R + S; this
becomes – s = – R + S ; hence t + s = 2R. Let the length of the isochronous pendulum
be equal to a; since this is 2a = f + h , it follows that t + s = 2 2ax and hence
2
R = 2ax and x = R
. Moreover, since x must be an even function of z, from this
2a
expression, that by itself can be obtained; for since R is an odd function, the square of this
is an even function. Therefore let R = z; then z = 2ax and S must be an even function
of 2ax or of x . From which done this equation is obtained : s = 2ax − S for all the
continuous tautochrone curves. [p. 230] Let dS = Tdx ; then T is some odd function of

x . Wherefore it becomes ds = adx −Tdx and

on putting PN = y. From which equation an infinite number of tautochronous curves are
found. Q.E.I.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Corollary 1.
456. Therefore the curve AN found in this manner is a tautochrone with the continuous
part AM of itself. Now by the preceding problem an infinite number of other curves AM
are given, which joined with the curve AN produce isochronous oscillations.
Corollary 2.
457. By the preceding proposition, all the curves AM, of which this is the equation :
produces isochronous oscillations with the curve AN . But the length of the isochronous
pendulum of these oscillations is equal to
( a + c )2
.

Corollary 3.
458. Hence among these infinite curves AM with AN producing isochronous oscillations
is that continuous with AN, in which c = a. And the length of the isochronous pendulum
becomes equal to a, as we have assumed.
Corollary 4.
459. If we put c = 0, then also this curve AM, of which the equation is dt = Tdx or
2ax
t = S, is tautochronous with the curve AN . And in this case the length of the pendulum is
a . [p. 231] Hence as often as T = 2bx , so also tautochronism is produced with the
4
right line AN, if thus it is inclined at an angle, such that the secant of the angle MAP is
equal to ba .
Corollary 5.
460. Since the curve AN must be normal to the axis AP at A, it is required that T vanishes
on putting x = 0. Also likewise it follows from this, since a – T must be a positive
quantity, even at the starting point A. For if T should become infinite on putting x = 0,
agreeing with infinite modes, yet thus, as S vanishes on putting x = 0, the curve AN falls
on the other part of the axis AP and the curve has a cusp at A and the body, after
descending on MA, ascends on reflection on AN, which would be contrary to the nature of
the oscillations.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Corollary 6.
461. Therefore if T vanishes on putting x = 0, the radius of osculation at A, which is sds
,
dx
as s = y in this place is equal to a and thus the oscillations agree with the smallest
oscillations of the pendulum of length a, as we assumed.
Corollary 7.
462. The part of the curve AN has a vertical tangent at D and a cusp there ; since the point
is found from this equation a − T = 2ax on taking AC equal to the value of x from this
equation. The other part too AM has a cusp, if somewhere it becomes : a + T = 2ax .
Corollary 8. [p. 232]
463. If it happens that S = 0 and T = 0, then s = 2ax . Whereby the curve is a cycloid
and the part AN is equal and similar to the curve AM. Hence it is a continuous cycloid
curve, upon which all the oscillations are completed in the same time.
Example.
464. Let T = 2bx , in which case the curve AN is also a tautochrone with the right line

.
Which equation also agrees with that, which we found for the curve in the preceding
proposition, which constitutes a tautochrone with a straight line (452), if L is written for a
and n for
a . Whereby if b = a, an algebraic curve NAM also is found, which is a

tautochrone, the equation of which is :
dy = dx a − 22 x2ax
and the integral of this is :
Which is that curve, which constitutes a tautochrone with the vertical right line, as we
found above (452). Now the length of the isochronous pendulum is equal to a, if the body
is oscillating on this curve. But if it is moving on the right line AC and on part of the
curve AN, the length of the isochronous pendulum is a4 . And if D is the cusp of the curve,EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

then AC = 8 , now the other root AM rises to infinity. Besides this algebraic tautochrone
curve others are easily found.
