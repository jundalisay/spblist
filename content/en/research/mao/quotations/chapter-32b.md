In transforming a backward agricultural China into an advanced industrialized country, we are confronted with arduous tasks and our experience is far from adequate. So we must be good at learning.

Conditions are changing all the time. To adapt to the new conditions, one must study. Even those who have a better grasp of Marxism and are comparatively firm in their proletarian stand have to go on studying, have to absorb what is new and study new problems.

We can learn what we did not know. We are not only good at destroying the old world, we are also good at building the new.

The two different attitudes towards learning from others are:
- the dogmatic attitude of transplanting everything, whether or not it is suited to our conditions.   
  - This is no good. 
- using our heads and learn those things which suit our conditions, that is, to absorb whatever experience is useful to us. That is the attitude we should adopt.

The theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin is universally applicable. 

We should regard it not as a dogma, but as a guide to action. 

Studying it is not merely a matter of learning terms and phrases but of learning Marxism-Leninism as the science of revolution. 

It is not just a matter of understanding the general laws derived by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin from their extensive study of real life and revolutionary experience, but of studying their standpoint and method in examining and solving problems."

If we have a correct theory but merely prate about it, pigeonhole it and do not put it into practice, then that theory, however good, is of no significance.

It is necessary to master Marxist theory and apply it, master it for the sole purpose of applying it. 

If you can apply the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint in elucidating one or two practical problems, you should be commended and credited with some achievement.

The more problems you elucidate and the more comprehensively and profoundly you do so, the greater will be your achievement.

Marxist-Leninist theory is to be linked with the Chinese revolution by "shooting the arrow at the target". Marxism-Leninism is the arrow. The Chinese revolution is the target. 

Some comrades, however, are "shooting without a target" or shooting at random. Such people will harm the revolution. 

Those experienced in work must take up the study of theory and must read seriously; only then will they be able to systematize and synthesize their experience and raise it to the level of theory, only then will they not mistake their partial experience for universal truth and not commit empiricist errors. 

Reading is learning, but applying is also learning and the more important kind of learning at that. Our chief method is to learn warfare through warfare. 

A person who has had no opportunity to go to school can also learn warfare - he can learn through fighting in war. A revolutionary war is a mass undertaking; it is often not a matter of first learning and then doing, but of doing and then learning, for doing is itself learning.

There is a gap between the ordinary civilian and the soldier. But it is no Great Wall. It can be quickly closed by taking part in revolution, in war. 

<!-- By saying that it is not easy to learn and to apply, we mean that it  -->

This is hard to learn thoroughly and to apply skilfully. 

It is not difficult for civilians to cross the threshold and become soldiers.

To put the two statements together, we may cite the Chinese adage:


{{< q >}}
"Nothing in the world is difficult for one who sets his mind to it."* 
{{< /q >}}

{{< n n="This is a metaphysical Taoist saying. This goes against the materialist doctrine of Marx which says that the material world creates mental conditions. The proper materialist way is that people will be forced to become soldiers by an animalistic survival instinct, and not by any metaphysical willpower. This is similar to the Spartan method of training that leaves young men out to die and fend for themselves. This uses the Negative Force, opposite of Taoism which uses the Positive. This is proof that Chinese Communism actually injected some Taoist-Confucian metaphysics that is opposite of Marxism or materialism. This is why China has prospered, while Cuba, North Korea, and Russia have not. But because it is still materialist, it is not really that much better than the Western capitalist system" >}}


To cross the threshold is not difficult, and mastery, too, is possible provided one sets one's mind to the task and is good at learning.

We must learn to do economic work from all who know how, no matter who they are. We must esteem them as teachers, learning from them respectfully and conscientiously. We must not pretend to know when we do not know.

Knowledge is a matter of science, and no dishonesty or conceit whatsoever is permissible. What is required is definitely the reverse - honesty and modesty.

Complacency is the enemy of study. We cannot really learn anything until we rid ourselves of complacency. Our attitude towards ourselves should be "to be insatiable in learning" and towards others "to be tireless in teaching".

Some people have read a few Marxist books and think themselves quite learned. But what they have read has not penetrated, has not struck root in their minds. They do not know how to use it. Their class feelings remain as of old. 

Others are very conceited and having learned some book-phrases, think themselves terrific and are very cocky.

But whenever a storm blows up, they take a stand very different from that of the workers and the majority of the peasants. 

They waver while the latter stand firm, they equivocate while the latter are forthright.

In order to have a real grasp of Marxism, one must learn it not only from books, but mainly through class struggle, through practical work and close contact with the masses of workers and peasants.

 
We will all be speaking the same language when our intellectuals have gained some understanding of Marxism through:
- reading some Marxist books
- close contact with the masses of workers and peasants and through their own practical work

This is the common language of:
- patriotism
- the socialist system
- the communist world outlook. 

If that happens, all of us will certainly work much better.
