## Abstract

Is GDP a reliable indicator of environmental impact?

The trophic structure of economy says that GDP and money supplies are an excellent indicator of environmental impact. 

The trophic structure of the economy reflects that of the economy of nature: plants feed herbivores which feed predators and scavengers.

In the human economy:
- producers are farmers which  support
- primary consumers as heavy manufacturing, which support 
- secondary consumers (light manufacturing) and service providers (e.g., transportation). 

Economic activity — GDP — is measured with monetary flows of expenditure and income. 

The trophic theory of money is that money originates via the agricultural surplus that frees the hands for the division of labour unto manufacturing and service sectors. It therefore reflects the environmental impact of human activity. 

The primary corollary is that the quantity of money — and GDP — indicates the amount of agricultural surplus and related activity at the trophic base of the economy (i.e., mining, logging, commercial fishing and other extractive
activity) and the environmental impact of such activity. Inflation, technological progress (a function of
GDP), and international trade affect the precise relationship of real money supplies to environmental
impact in any given country, without affecting the underlying trophics. Purely financial activity, such
as speculation in derivatives, does not affect GDP or real money supplies.


The trophic theory of money is that, due
to the fundamental, ecological structure of
the human economy, real GDP (and real
money supplies) must indicate environmen-
tal impact, invariably and inevitably. 

This is the theory of money most congruent with
the biological sciences. It helps to delineate
the paradigm of sustainability science from
that of conventional economics.
In order to explain the trophic theory of
money I will here summarise: 1) the concept

P
erhaps the greatest disagreement in
sustainability science and policy stems
from the question: Does GDP invariably
indicate environmental impact? Some say
yes it must, while others adamantly say no,
but a great many respondents neither proffer
nor accept anything definitive. Their general
sense seems to be that GDP has indicated
environmental impact, ever since its meas-
ure was taken (1934 in the USA), but that,
theoretically, if the economy was structured

of trophic levels in nature; 2) the trophic
structure of the human economy; 3) why
the trophic structure of the human economy
entails a particular theory of money, and; 4)
precepts and corollaries of the trophic theory
of money. I will conclude by exploring some
implications of the trophic theory of money
for sustainability science and public policy.
The primary consumers are also called
“herbivores.” Consumers at secondary or
higher levels are “predators.” However, many
if not most predators supplement their diets
with plants; enough such supplementation
warrants the label “omnivore.” Homo sapiens
is a classic omnivore (Pollan 2006).
Trophic levels in the economy of
nature
The word “trophic” is defined as “of or
relating to nutrition” (Merriam-Webster
online dictionary) and connotes especially
the energy derived from food. The word is
seldom used outside of the ecological sci-
ences, where it is almost invariably coupled
with the noun “level.” A trophic level is a
set of species that occupy a similar position
with regard to the flow of energy (derived
from feeding) in the economy of nature
(Ricklefs and Miller 2000). The concept
of trophic levels is used to summarise two
major fields of ecological study: the energy
pathways associated with the sustenance of
species, and the relative biomass of major
categories of species.
A typical ecosystem has three basic trophic
levels: producers, primary consumers, and
higher-level consumers (Fig.1). The produc-
ers are plants, which produce their own food
through the process of photosynthesis. The
photosynthetic growth of plants is called
“primary production.”
All animal life depends on the plant
community for nutrition. Some animals
eat plants directly; these are the primary
consumers. Higher-level consumers eat pri-
mary consumers. Finer distinctions among
higher-level consumers are uncommon and
not usually dealt with in terms of trophic
levels, but rather in the more detailed terms
of food webs and energy pathway diagrams.
Figure 1: Trophic structure of: (a) economy
of nature and (b) human economy (from
Czech 2013).
Although the basic trophic levels comprising
the economy of nature are simple to under-
stand, it can be challenging to categorise
particular species. A fox living in one eco-
system, or at a particular time of year, or at
a particular age, may subsist primarily on
plant materials (as with a primary consumer),
while a fox in different circumstances may
subsist primarily on small animals (as with a
secondary consumer). Few ecologists would
classify a fox as a primary consumer, how-
ever. Taken as a whole, fox species — as
well as most other canids — are classified
as predators that happen to be somewhat
omnivorous.
Some species are not readily categorised
into trophic levels. Scavengers, for example,
are neither plant eaters nor predators most
of the time. Yet they do eat primarily animal
tissue, so are categorised as secondary con-
sumers in trophic terms. The fact that they
“clean up” the ecosystem of rotting flesh leads
us to also call them, somewhat anthropo-
morphically, “service providers.” Numerous
other services are performed in the economy
67Journal & Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales
Czech — The trophic theory of money
of nature such as pollination, decomposi-
tion, and the provision of hiding or thermal
cover. As members of the economy of nature,
service providers may be designated in the
trophic structure as necessarily interacting
with the “regular” members. Their lives of
service would not be sustained without the
other species and, as with the regular con-
sumers, they are ultimately dependent upon
the photosynthetic activity of plants.
The human niche is so broad — human
activities are so variable — that the human
economy itself has a well-developed trophic
structure (Fig.1). Farmers are the produc-
ers. As with the plants in the economy of
nature, farmers produce their own food, and
their surplus production is then available
for consumers. This was emphasised by the
18th-century French physiocrat, Francois
Quesnay, in the Tableau Economique.
However, within the human economy,
most members do not make their living by
literally eating the members of lower trophic
levels. The “living” made by humans goes
far beyond mere feeding to encompass the
production and consumption of a great
diversity of goods and services, and we
may also include loggers, miners, ranchers,
oilmen, and fishermen as “producers” in the
human economy. Each of them “produces”
goods needed by themselves and others in
the human economy, although technically
they extract such goods directly from stocks
of natural capital such as timber, minerals,
and forage. Farmers still come closest to
being true producers — in the physiocratic
and ecological sense — because instead of
extracting per se, they participate closely
with the process of photosynthesis, the ulti-
mate production process for life on Earth.
Manufacturers use raw materials extracted
by the producers to manufacture goods.
They range from a heavy manufacturing base
(such as mineral refining) up through the
trophic pyramid to the lightest manufactur-
ing sectors (e.g., computer chip manufactur-
ing) (Fig. 1). Heavy manufacturing requires
the rawest of materials, whereas much of
the light manufacturing is performed with
refined or manufactured materials flowing
from lower in the trophic structure.
Trophic structure of the human
economy
As emphasised in ecological economics and
sustainability studies, the human economy is
a subset of the economy of nature. In terms
of trophic levels, which theoretically range
up to 5.5 for large carnivores, human trophic
levels range from approximately 2.04–2.57
(Bonhommeau et al. 2013), reflecting not
only an omnivorous tendency but substan-
tial variation among cultures. Yet humans
also occupy and dominate the apex of the
trophic structure in the sense of consuming
virtually every other species that is edible,
palatable, and economical to harvest (Czech
2000, Roopnarine 2014). These species
include numerous highly predaceous fish,
reptiles, and mammals, many of which are
systematically harvested in various cultures.
Conversely, only in extremely rare instances
do nonhumans hunt and consume humans.
As a mammalian species, Homo sapiens
follows the same natural laws that apply to
the other species in the economy of nature.
In addition to residing in the trophic struc-
ture, humans must abide by the laws of ther-
modynamics and the principles of ecology.
What distinguishes humans most, in eco-
logical terms, is the breadth of the human
niche, which reflects the unique mental and
physical capabilities of Homo sapiens (King-
don 1993).

As in the economy of nature, service sec-
tors in the human economy are not readily
placed in particular trophic levels. Cashiers,
cab drivers, janitors and other service provid-
ers do not produce or consume in a system-
atic fashion that proceeds upward from one
trophic level to the next. A truck driver may
deliver a load of logs from forest to sawmill
one day, and a load of lumber from sawmill
to farm the next. The banker may lend to the
farmer or the capitalist. Professional athletes
entertain farmers, industrialists, and bankers.
Each contributes in some way to GDP, yet
none would contribute in any way without
the producers, as there would be no one to
service.
we get from a trophic perspective provides
insights to several of the other issues as well,
and goes beyond to address the question at
the heart of this paper: Do GDP and money
supplies invariably indicate environmental
impact?
The trophic theory of money is that
money originates as a matter of agricultural
surplus, and that the generation or flow of
real money (“real” meaning adjusted for
inflation) is a real measure of — not just a
variable affecting — economic output. The
trophic theory of money also posits that
the quantity of real money — and/or eco-
nomic output as measured by GDP — must
indicate environmental impact, including
biodiversity loss, pollution, and ecological
footprint. We can go so far as to posit that
GDP is such a fundamental, reliable indica-
tor of environmental impact that it may be
considered a “measure” per se. In this sense,
GDP is analogous to the volume of engine
displacement, which is such a reliable indica-
tor of horsepower that it has overtaken that
somewhat esoteric measure. Engine displace-
ment offers the substantial advantages of
being easy to measure and being one of the
specifications (“specs”) invariably provided
with the product. With such advantages, few
people are required or compelled to purchase
an expensive and cumbersome dynamom-
eter to measure horsepower per se.
Unlike engine displacement, GDP is
not necessarily easy or simple to measure.
However, calculating GDP is relatively
straightforward given the principles of
national income accounting, including the
fundamental identity thereof: Production =
Income = Expenditure (Lequiller and Blades
2014). More importantly, GDP is carefully
and consistently measured pursuant to the
policies and procedures of the U.S. Bureau
A theory of money for sustainability
science
There is no authoritative source for establish-
ing precisely what is required of a theory
of money, but myriad “theories” have been
proffered pertaining to the following ques-
tions:
• How does money originate?
• How does the quantity of money relate
to the quantity of real economic output?
• How is the quantity of money related to
prices?
• What influences the velocity of money in
circulation?
• What is the proper authority over money
supplies and other monetary policy?
The trophic theory of money is primarily
concerned with the first question: the origins
of money. This is an appropriate question
to prioritise, for, as Aristotle said, “He who
thus considers things in their first growth
and origin ... will obtain the clearest view of
them” (Aristotle 2008:26). Indeed, the view

Czech — The trophic theory of money
of Economic Analysis (and by analogous
bureaus in other countries). It is an already
available “spec” that, if indeed a reliable
measure of environmental impact, makes
it largely unnecessary to develop alternative,
costly, and cumbersome metrics.
The trophic theory of money suggests
that GDP may be viewed as “the” measure
of environmental impact — especially in
aggregate contexts such as the environmental
impact of a nation — more than any other
single indicator of environmental impact per
se. A natural corollary is that the quantity
of money is a negative indicator of sustain-
ability.
of coins — and who authorises its creation.
Although this issue is relevant to ecological
economics, particularly the theme of wealth
distribution, it is not our concern with the
trophic theory of money.
Another use of the phrase “origins of
money” is in historical or evolutionary con-
text, where the line of inquiry is, “When was
money first used, and how did such usage
come about?” The trophic theory of money
has much to offer in this context, as we will
see.
However, with the trophic theory, “ori-
gins” is also used in a more fundamental,
ecological, and ontological sense. Just as the
laws of thermodynamics are more funda-
mental than conventional economic “laws”
pertaining to the real sector (Say’s Law, for
example), trophic theory is more fundamen-
tal — more grounded in the natural sciences
and first principles — than conventional
economic theories pertaining to the mone-
tary sector. In fact, trophic theory itself rests
on a solid foundation of thermodynamics.
Put in plainest terms, trophic theory may
be summarised as: You can’t get something
from nothing (first law of thermodynamics),
and you can never achieve 100% efficiency
in the production of biomass (second law of
thermodynamics). Therefore, of all the theo-
ries of money, the trophic theory of money
is most congruent with the natural sciences.
The origins of money — trophic and
historical
Money may be defined as anything that func-
tions in society as a medium of exchange,
unit of account, and store of value (Davies
2002). In the scholarly literature many
commodities are cited as historic forms of
“money,” but Seaford (1994) insisted that, to
qualify as money per se, the item in question
must be the exclusive medium of exchange
(and unit of account, and store of value).
This qualification rules out the vast majority
of barter commodities that preceded minted
coins and paper currency. Therefore these
barter commodities, when portrayed as
“money,” are usually done so with the quali-
fier “commodity.” In societies with enough
surplus and division of labour to barter, long
periods of using commodity money nearly
always preceded the use of money per se
(Weatherford 1997).
The phrase “origins of money” connotes
these conceptual, historical, and linguistic
considerations of money. Sometimes the
phrase is used in discussions of who or what
actually creates the physical money per se
— as in the printing of bills or the minting
Agricultural surplus and the origins of
money
Why does real money originate as a matter
of agricultural surplus? In the simplest of
terms, because without agricultural surplus
there is no division of labour, and neither the
need nor even the opportunity to develop a
monetary system. In fact, given the trophic
theory of money, one would expect the fol-
lowing, and only in the following order:
70Journal & Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales
Czech — The trophic theory of money
1. development of agriculture, successful
enough for ongoing surplus production
analogous to agricultural surplus per se.
Shell, for example — most notably cowry
— was first used as commodity money in
coastal societies (Davies 2002). Given the
trophic theory of money, we readily note
that fish harvesting must have been suffi-
ciently productive in these circumstances as
to be analogous to agricultural surplus, and
this indeed is borne out in the archeological
literature (Kingdon 1993). It is no coinci-
dence, then, that widespread, long-lasting,
systematic use of money — certainly coinage
— did not occur prior to the domestication
of plants and the development of agricul-
tural crops during the Neolithic Revolution.
Similarly, it is no coincidence that money
is not known to have circulated far outside
areas of agricultural surplus during the Neo-
lithic Period. This may come as a surprise to
some, because misinformation on this topic
is prevalent. For example, a stylish article,
“When — and why — did people first start
to use money” (Kusimba 2017) appears in
the “Science and Technology” section of The
Conversation (an online journal advertising
its “academic rigor” in its subtitle). Kusim-
ba’s (2017) article will be one of the first arti-
cles located using internet search engines and
the search phrase, “first use of money,” and
its second sentence provides “...the history
of human beings using cash currency does
go back a long time — 40,000 years.” This
astonishing claim is undermined a mere six
paragraphs further, where we are reminded
of the closest thing to consensus in numis-
matics, “The Mesopotamian shekel — the
first known form of currency — emerged
nearly 5,000 years ago.” Nothing in the arti-
cle remotely supports the notion of “cash
currency” at any time during the Paleolithic
Period (i.e., the “Stone Ages” including
40,000 BP). Rather, there is only mention
2. division of labour into numerous agricul-
tural and non-agricultural pursuits
3. development of a money supply and
system (almost invariably preceded by
widespread bartering and proto-money)
Adam Smith briefly alluded to this natu-
ral sequence in Chapter 4 of the Wealth of
Nations, and likely his study of Quesnay’s
Tableau guided his thinking (Czech 2013).1
The sequence seems to emanate a certain
cultural and political orderliness, but more
fundamentally is pre-ordained by ecologi-
cal reality. Any other sequence of the three
stages is virtually prohibited by the princi-
ples of ecology. The evolution of the human
trophic structure, starting with agricultural
surplus, is what makes money a meaningful
concept and “authorises” the development of
a monetary system.
The development and use of money in the
absence of agricultural surplus is so incon-
ceivable and nonsensical that it evidently
never occurred in the long arc of human
evolution. As Ferguson (2008:20) observed,
“Hunter-gatherers do not trade ... Nor do
they save, consuming their food as and when
they find it. They therefore have no need
of money.” That is a bit of an oversimplifi-
cation, but if money was used in pre-agri-
cultural settings, it was so limited in scope
and functionality as to go undocumented
in the archeological record. Furthermore, it
would have occurred where some other form
of food surplus was relatively widespread and
long lasting; i.e., under conditions highly
Quesnay, it should be noted, was a Renaissance man
in the king’s court of post-Renaissance France, and
was especially an expert in agricultural production
and economics.

Czech — The trophic theory of money
of bartering for “flint weapons and other
tools” among hunters.
The trophic theory of money provides an
ecologically rich explanation for the tran-
sition from barter through “commodity
money” to money per se. The development
of a thorough, economic trophic structure
including a diversity of manufacturing sec-
tors from heavy to light — and supporting
a diversity of service sectors — is essentially
the story of human evolution from hunter/
gatherers to modern actors in the indus-
trial and computerised economy (Kingdon
1993). The intermediate ages of transition
from hunting/gathering to widespread agri-
cultural surplus brought to a certain frui-
tion the producer trophic level and set the
stage for divisions of labour, both within
the producer level (including unto the many
extractive trades and specialties) and beyond
to manufacturing and services.
This transition did not occur overnight
— indeed it comprised “ages” — which
explains why there was such a lengthy, hard-
to-delineate transition from barter to money
per se, which did evidently span the ages
from approximately 40,000–5,000 BP.
The gradual nature of this transition is
reflected in the best-documented exam-
ples of commodity money (Table 1). Shell
was noted above; its commodity value was
primarily as jewelry. The shell of Cypraea
moneta (“money cowry”) in particular, was
durable, convenient, recogniisable, and
divisible, so it was naturally selected as cur-
rency (Van Damme 2007). The use of shell
lasted so long, it hasn’t entirely died out on
the Indonesian archipelago.
Some scholars have considered cattle
in herding societies to be the first form
of “money,” yet cattle “cannot be properly
considered as money because, being such
a ‘heavy’ or expensive unit of account and
standard of value, they were not very suited
to performing the other more mobile func-
tions of being a good means of payment
and medium of exchange, which apparently
demanded something much smaller than,
say, a cow” (Davies 2002:42). As Davies
(2002) pointed out, cattle are more accu-
rately designated as an early form of working
capital. As with shell in coastal economies,
however, the use of cattle in exchange would
hardly be an exception to the trophic theory
of money, because surplus cattle in pastoral-
ist cultures were analogous to crop surplus
in agrarian cultures.
Non-necessity of money
The trophic theory of money does not imply
that agricultural surplus must result in the
use of money; only that the use of money is
predicated upon agricultural surplus. There
were evidently ancient cultures — perhaps
most famously Mayans and Aztecs — who
developed relatively long-lasting agricultural
surpluses and yet never developed monetary
systems with exclusive currencies (Table 1).
Even the Mayans, though, used cacao
beans and greenstone beads as common
means of exchange (Sharer 2009). Further-
more, it seems likely the Mayans would have
developed a monetary system if not for their
mysterious demise (circa 800-900 AD) and
later devastation by the Spanish. With their
use of beans and beads, the Mayans were
clearly on the brink of using money per se,
but then evidently exceeded their ecological
capacity, a process exacerbated by a devastat-
ing drought (Diamond 2005). The popula-
tion declined sharply and Mayans retreated
into peasantry, with very little surplus or
division of labour. Some Native American
tribes in North America, especially in the
ecologically productive river valleys of the

East, produced large agricultural surpluses
(most notably with the “three sisters” of corn,
beans, and squash) and developed complex
economic societies (Stannard 1992, Park et
al. 2016). Prior to European contact they
used wampumpeag, or “wampum,” as a
means of exchange (Davies 2002). Wampum
— most commonly from the widespread
freshwater clam Venus mercenaria — had
some medicinal value, being useful in the
stopping of nosebleed (Francis 1986). It was
kept as beads and accumulated in strings,
and was therefore readily stored in various
quantities, including common amounts
often used in exchange (analogous, for exam-
ple, to ten-dollar bills today).
As with the Mayans, some of the North
American tribes were on the verge of using
money per se. However, conquest by Euro-
peans, and more importantly widespread
smallpox, decimated many tribes and
severely impacted the rest (Stannard 1992).
While the earliest colonists apparently used
wampum and Native American commodi-
ties as often as English coinage, distinctly
“American” forms of money developed rap-
idly as the great expanse of rich American
ecosystems was highly conducive to agricul-
tural surplus and wide open for business in
multiple trophic levels, having been vacated
by the smallpox-ridden tribes. Wampum was
eclipsed by pieces of eight (Spanish reales),
New England schillings, revolutionary
“continentals,” Civil War “greenbacks,” and
finally dollars and cents.
As Weatherford (1997:59) postulated,
Prior to the invention of money in the
form of coins, the chapters of history over-
flow with stories of many civilisations on
different continents speaking different lan-
guages and worshiping different gods, but
73Journal & Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales
Czech — The trophic theory of money
we see in virtually all of them a common
pattern. Whether we consider the ancient
Egyptians or the Aztecs, the Hittites or
the Babylonians, the Cretans or the mys-
terious people of Mohenjo-Daro, we see
that they all appear to have risen only to
a similar level of civilisation. It is almost
as though each of them encountered
the same invisible wall, which they were
unable to penetrate. They developed their
own architecture and religion, science and
commerce, poetry and music only so far
before they stagnated. The Greeks, how-
ever, broke through this barrier. Suddenly,
architecture, philosophy, science, litera-
ture, and the other arts and sciences soared
to a level of attainment unknown to any
earlier civilisation. Some scholars would
have us believe that this breakthrough
arose from some superior quality of the
Greek mind, psyche, race, or culture ...
Weatherford went on to ascribe the “break-
through” to the Greeks’ proximity to Lydia,
where the first known coins were minted
(Table 1). In his opinion, the Greeks took
the Lydian invention and brought it to new
heights, along with all the activities it was
exchanged for.
No doubt the availability of a widely
accepted, easily accounted, and durable
means of exchange allowed for efficient,
swift transaction. In a sense, a reliable cur-
rency reduced transaction costs, as economic
actors of all kinds could quickly exchange
their goods and services and get on with life
(including production and consumption of
more goods and services), rather than strug-
gling to measure, agree upon, or even rec-
ognise the various forms of proto-money. It
was as if the adoption of currency lifted an
unspecified tax previously inflicting Greek
society.
That said, given the trophic theory of
money, Weatherford’s attribution to money
of such a profound “breakthrough” in Greek
civilisation is unfounded. There was no
“invisible wall” mysteriously preventing the
Greeks from flourishing. Rather, they shared
a common ancient history with other peo-
ples who underwent the long gradual process
of agriculture. It was their eventual achieve-
ment of substantial surplus that allowed for
significant division of labour as well as for
the use of money in exchanging the fruits
of their labour.
It is somewhat remarkable that the Greeks
did not have the benefit of a “breadbasket”
such as the American plains or Ukrainian
steppes. On the other hand they did benefit
tremendously from a Mediterranean climate
and diverse ecosystems superior for agricul-
tural (and pastoral) purposes to those of the
Mayans, for example. Meanwhile abundant
coastline allowed them to supplement their
terrestrial production with protein and fat
intake from fish. Furthermore, there is noth-
ing about the trophic theory of money to
deny the relevance of raiding, warfare, and
eventually regional trade to increasing food
surpluses and trophic development. The long
history of Greek warfare — largely success-
ful prior to the Roman Empire — brought
with it the spoils of war, including Persian
goods. These goods added to what the Greeks
produced themselves and had the effect of
increasing Greek agricultural surplus, freeing
the hands for a further division of labour and
the exchanging of additional money.
Agricultural surplus and the quantity
of money
If the origins of money are in agricultural sur-
plus pursuant to the trophic theory of money,
then it is not far-fetched to hypothesise that
the quantity of money — and/or the level
74Journal & Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales
Czech — The trophic theory of money
of GDP — is proportional to agricultural
surplus. There is in fact plenty of evidence to
support this hypothesis. The shekel, for exam-
ple, originated as literally 180 grains (or “she”)
of barley (Acton and Goldblatt 2010). One
can hardly find a better example of money
supplies tracking with agricultural surplus!
(Barley reserved for exchange, and therefore
not consumed as food, represents a surplus.)
The salient point, though, is that the grain
of barley could have instead been a gram of
silver, nickel, or lead. Although each of these
metals was also useful as a commodity, none
would have been useful as money per se if the
barley (and other food) surplus hadn’t allowed
for the division of labour and the subsequent
exchange of goods and services.
Indeed shekels evolved to become meas-
ures of barley in terms of silver equivalent.
The weight of the original shekel (i.e., the
she of barley) became the weight in silver
that was worth one gur (a type of container,
hauled on an ass) of barley. In other words,
a gur of barley cost a silver shekel, and vice
versa (Cripps 2017). Evidently for much of
Mesopotamian civilisation, as documented
most assiduously in Assyrian cuneiform
bookkeeping, this was the case, and these
units of barley and silver comprised the pri-
mary forms of Mesopotamian proto-money
(Cripps 2017). Ultimately, however, barley
gave way to minted silver coins — money
per se — if for no other reason than coins
were far more durable as a store of value.
This giving way to silver coins also hints at
increasing agriculture surplus, because there
is little need for durable storage when grain
surplus is a year-to-year concern.
Another indicator of agricultural surplus
highly relevant to the trophic theory of
money is the percentage of farmers in society.
This indicator of surplus is straightforward.
If it takes one farmer to support two indi-
viduals (including the one farmer), we have
50% farmers, and little demand for exchange.
Money is extremely unlikely to originate in
such a scenario, although it might be used
to some extent if it flows in from adjacent
regions where agricultural surplus is high.
(Money might also originate if the small sur-
plus is predictable and reliable for lengthy
periods of time, but that is notoriously rare
in agriculture). Conversely, if one farmer
supports 10 economic actors, we have 10%
farmers, and palpable demand for exchange.
Money is likely to originate in such a sce-
nario; alternatively, if money circulates in
adjacent regions, it is likely to be adopted.
As a variable affecting the origins of
money and money supplies, the percent-
age of farmers offers insight into why the
Mayans never quite “advanced” to the stage
of money per se. As Diamond (2005:164)
described, “At least 70% of Maya society
consisted of peasants... because Maya agri-
culture suffered from several limitations.”
These limitations included low yields, low
protein production, and difficulty storing
crops due to a humid climate. Each of these
limitations would have precluded substantial
division of labour or the development of a
thorough trophic structure. What little divi-
sion of labour occurred was primarily into
soldiering and slavery (for serving soldiers
and nobility).
In sharp contrast is the modern United
States, where farmers comprise approxi-
mately 2% of the population and each
farmer can feed “on the average 125 other
people” including Americans and among for-
eign trading partners (Diamond 2005:164).
This is a level of agricultural surplus capable
of supporting a thorough and rich (in sev-
eral ways) trophic structure, conducive to a

tremendous amount of exchange, which in
turn calls for a means thereof; i.e., money.
gate (Czech et al. 2000). The staggering loss
of biodiversity is perhaps the greatest indica-
tor of environmental impact (Wilson 2017).
Indeed most if not all the areas associ-
ated with the early use of money are also
associated with early episodes of ecologi-
cal degradation and limits to growth. For
example, the Yellow River Basin is the
“cradle of Chinese civilisation” (Feng et al.
2006:125) where Chinese agriculture and
money originated. There, too, millennia of
trophic buildup have led to an environmen-
tal crisis of equally historic proportions. It is
no coincidence that the Loess Plateau (along
the Yellow River) is the first region identified
in assessments of Chinese environmental
history (see for example Maohong 2004).
The plateau “had been over-cultivated and
overgrazed, resulting in soil erosion and a
criss-cross network of gullies, following the
development of civilisation in the Yellow
River valley” (Maohong 2004:480).
Agriculture, money, and
environmental impact
Pursuant to the trophic theory of money,
the human economy — the size of which is
measured by GDP — proliferates in propor-
tion to agricultural surplus. Meanwhile agri-
culture has environmental impacts (Bodley
2012). Primitive agriculture would have had
slight impact, but as agriculture intensified
toward the levels required for divisions of
labour — and the use of money — so too did
its impact. Mesopotamia again provides an
early example. The amount of barley (proto-
money) cultivated in Mesopotamia — the
“land between the rivers” — was a function of
the amount of land irrigated along the Tigris
and Euphrates Rivers and tributaries. But as
Bodley (2012:52) described, “There is clear
evidence that intensive agricultural practices
in ancient Mesopotamia, where irrigation
causes the gradual accumulation of salts in
the soil, were also contributing factors in the
fall of Sumerian civilisation after 2000 [BC].”
Obviously, too, the mining of silver and
gold has pronounced environmental impacts.
The fact that these metals have long been the
primary metals used in coinage is symbolic
of the fact that all extractive activities near
the base of the economic trophic structure
have a heavy footprint on the environment.
Yet the obviousness of these impacts should
not obscure the effects of all economic sec-
tors throughout the trophic structure of the
human economy. All sectors have direct envi-
ronmental effects, but more profoundly, all
are portions of an economy that grows as an
integrated whole. Due to the tremendous
breadth of the human niche, this trophically
structured economy grows at the competitive
exclusion of non-human species in the aggre-
Circular flow of money
In conventional economics and business
textbooks, the economy is often modeled as
a circular flow of money, with factors of pro-
duction flowing in one direction and pay-
ments thereto in the other. In circular flow
diagrams, the factors of production are often
limited to labour L and capital K. Money
certainly does flow between labour and capi-
tal. Capital pays wages; labour turns around
and purchases from capital, and there is an
obvious circularity to the process.
Unfortunately the circular flow of money
depicted in textbooks typically leaves out
the ecological context, as well as a crucial
factor of production. While the circular flow
displays labour and capital as the factors
of production, it typically leaves out land,
which is at once an essential factor of pro-
duction and a boundary within which labour
76Journal & Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales
Czech — The trophic theory of money
and capital must operate. This omission is
wholly conducive to the broader neoclassi-
cal propensity to ignore limits to growth. In
a sense, the omission reflects the “landless
production function” of output Y = f {K,L}
(Czech 2013:158). With the circular flow
of money and the landless production func-
tion in mind, the student can hardly avoid
envisioning the economy growing outward
into boundless space.
The trophic theory of money alleviates
this problem because merely including
money in the circular flow diagram accounts
for agricultural surplus and environmental
impact. With the trophic theory of money,
the circular flow can hardly be considered
without recognising limits to growth. The
circular flow suddenly becomes a dem-
onstration of how money cannot become
unhitched from the real economy. It must
indeed reflect the flows between capital and
labour. These entities are readily recognised
as actors in the trophic structure of the real
economy. If the trophic structure is not more
heavily drawn upon (i.e., without additional
surplus at the agricultural base), the injec-
tion of more money fails to reflect what is
happening in the real economy. Instead, it
is simply an episode of inflation.
financial speculation itself has no effect on
GDP or real money supplies, although it is
suspected of having an effect on nominal
GDP (Sipko 2011).
Speculation itself should not be confused
with the services of the brokers, agents and
bankers who earn an income for assisting
customers fulfill their speculations. This dis-
tinction — service vs speculation — helps
clarify the real nature of GDP. Speculation
is similar to gambling whereby the specula-
tor “bets” (presumably with some analytical
insight) on the chances of particular trends
in interest rates, stock prices, insurance
claims, and a wide variety of other financial
data. Nothing in the trophic structure of the
economy is produced or consumed in the act
of speculation. However, the placing of bets
requires transacting, recording, and account-
ing, performed by brokers, agents and bank-
ers. These are real people using real energy
and material (e.g., office equipment and sup-
plies) to provide a real service accounted for
in GDP. The key point, vis-à-vis the trophic
theory of money, is that none of the brokers,
agents or bankers would be operating in the
absence of agricultural surplus. Their income
required real surplus at the trophic base of
the economy.
Perhaps an even better example is of gam-
bling per se. If a gambler “spends” a mil-
lion dollars at a casino and returns with a
thousand dollars short of that, GDP doesn’t
increase by a million; rather by somewhat
less (accounting for casino depreciation)
than the one thousand that went toward the
wages of casino employees and the profits to
the casino owner and creditors. The approxi-
mately $999,000 difference was but a whirl-
pool outside the circular flow of money, a
sort of sideshow the gambler paid to watch,
with the services of casino employees.
Money, GDP, and finance
It is a common misunderstanding outside
the world of monetary policy and national
income accounting that the traffic in recent
years of financial products such as rainbow
derivatives with iron butterfly options pur-
chased online, perhaps even with Bitcoin,
somehow represents a “new economy.” This
misunderstanding, which even afflicts envi-
ronmental and ecological economics, readily
morphs into the notion that we live in an
“information economy” unrooted or decou-
pled from biophysical throughput. In reality
77Journal & Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales
Czech — The trophic theory of money
Likewise, the trophic theory of money
says nothing about purely financial (or gam-
bling) activity; only the real labours of those
hosting and administering such activity.
Therefore flow variables such as “volume of
transactions” are not particularly relevant for
assessing the trophic theory, because many
transactions occur in purely speculative set-
tings. These transactions divert money from
the circular flow, similar to play diverting an
animal’s energy from feeding or reproduc-
tion. The trophic theory of money is focused
on the origins and quantities of real money
supplies and productive flows accounted
for in GDP, as reflected for example in the
activities listed in the North America Indus-
try Classification System (Office of Manage-
ment and Budget 2017).
Meanwhile, in managing the money
supply, the Federal Reserve System (and
analogous monetary authorities in other
countries) is focused primarily on staving
off high rates of inflation (Axilrod 2013).
Although the Fed is hardly known for an
ecological background, economists at the
Fed (as well as accountants in the Bureau of
Economic Analysis) have developed a feel for
keeping the money supply in balance with
the real sector and its trophic structure. For
the money supply to accurately reflect the
production and consumption of goods and
services in the aggregate is the essence of the
phrase “real GDP.”
may be referred to synonymously as eco-
logical or economic capacity) can be assessed
with GDP. Reaching capacity will amount
to a stabilization of GDP, or a steady state
economy. Breaching capacity will result in
declining GDP; i.e., recession or degrowth.
If the recession is abrupt and substantial, the
scenario may warrant the label “collapse.”
Therefore, when economic growth is
continuously prioritised, there comes a
time when real GDP declines while the
environmental impact of economic activity
continues to grow. Environmental impact
continues to grow due to ecological momen-
tum (such as ecosystem unravelling as a
function of climate change), anachronistic
efforts to stimulate the economy (such as
loosening environmental protections), and
the getting by of millions or billions of
people, many of whom are now (by defini-
tion of collapse) attempting to grow their
own food on a crowded and exhausted land-
scape. This by no means refutes the trophic
theory of money. Rather, the dissipation of
GDP under these circumstances is analo-
gous to a chemical reaction culminating at
a titre level. Instead of being refuted by col-
lapse, the trophic theory of money provides
insight to foresee (and potentially obviate)
collapse. For example, when a nation’s fiscal,
monetary, environmental and social policies
are designed increasingly for GDP growth,
without the desired effects, leaders should
recognise that real fundamentals are no
longer conducive to growth. Pursuant to the
trophic theory of money, these fundamen-
tals include the agricultural and extractive
resources available for further capitalization
at the trophic base. Conversely, without the
trophic theory of money, it is easy to envi-
sion policy makers pursuing wispy notions
of “dematerialised” GDP.
The trophic theory of money under
scenarios of recession and collapse
As a basic rule of ecology, any species that
uses continuously more energy and resources
— as Homo sapiens does in the process of
economic growth — will reach or breach
its carrying capacity. Pursuant to the trophic
theory of money, the distinction between
reaching and breaching capacity (which
78Journal & Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales
Czech — The trophic theory of money
R&D is inching to the limits of its capacity
to produce new technologies that increase
productivity, not for any lack of human
imagination, but rather for lack of the real
resources required for economic growth.
Therefore, technological progress is having
less of an effect on GDP and real money
supplies than it did in the 20th century. As
total factor productivity reaches its limits, so
too will the effects of R&D on GDP and real
money supplies.
The propensity to use money as a means
of exchange self-evidently affects real money
supplies. In-home provision of services or
widespread reversion to bartering, for exam-
ple, would lessen the demand for and neces-
sity of money. Nothing about the effect of
this variable affects the trophic theory of
money or the validity of its corollaries.
Variables affecting the relationships
among trophic levels, GDP, and
environmental impact
The trophic theory of money does not imply
that nothing except agricultural surplus
affects GDP and real money supplies. We
have already noted inflation and accounted
for it with phrases such as “real money” and
“real GDP.” Two other variables are worth
mentioning: technological progress and
the propensity to use money as a means of
exchange.
The effects of technological progress on
GDP and real money supplies are relatively
straightforward, even if not widely under-
stood. Technological progress is not manna
from heaven. Rather, it occurs as a function
of research and development (R&D), which
in turn is a function of economic growth
based upon pre-existing technology (Czech
2008). This latter aspect is overlooked in
Pollyannaish visions of dematerialisation.
With a firm grasp of the relationships among
economic growth, R&D, and technological
progress, there is nothing surprising about
the declining rates of total factor productiv-
ity that seem to perplex many economists
and economic journalists (see for example
Economist 2017). The natural resources avail-
able at the trophic base have been heavily
harvested over millennia, and many natural
capital stocks have been liquidated. The low-
hanging thermodynamic fruits (e.g., con-
centrated minerals lying close to the ground,
abundant fisheries, oilfields with high energy
return on investment) have been picked.
Meanwhile new technologies do nothing to
change the trophic demands of the economy.
Water, for example, cannot be substituted for.
The trophic structure of the economy is fully
fleshed out as congruent with Daly’s con-
cept of a “full-world economy” (2007:76).
Linguistic and rhetorical
considerations
The phrase “trophic theory of money” offers
substantial linguistic advantages. First, it is
clear and concise. It is as it sounds; i.e., a
theory of money based upon the trophic
principles of ecology. The emphasis on
trophic principles is warranted as described
in the preceding sections for, without
trophic maturation, money does not origi-
nate. Although the word “trophic” is some-
what academic, the clarity, concision, and
appropriate emphasis of “trophic theory of
money” is superior to “money as a function
of agricultural surplus” or other less efficient
phrases.
“Trophic theory of money” also offers
the rhetorical advantage of communicating,
emphasising, or reminding readers and audi-
ences of the ecological basis of the economy.
As such, it offers the field of sustainability
science its own theory of money; a theory
most congruent with an emphasis on the

laws of thermodynamics and principles of
ecology. It serves to belie the unsubstantiated
proposition that real GDP may somehow be

Nothing, perhaps, should grate the senses
of the sustainability scholar more than the
loosely issued phrase “X generated millions
of dollars of income,” where X might be golf-
ing, shooting, or even gambling. The only
activity that clearly qualifies for the title of
“generating” money is agriculture. It is agri-
cultural surplus that frees the hands for the
division of labour, even unto the entertain-
ments of golfing, shooting, and gambling.
Money is spent on these latter activities, not
“generated” therefrom.
Not even construction, auto making,
or steel refining has a legitimate claim on
“generating money.” The only activities that
might qualify for consideration, other than
agriculture, would be those analogous activi-
ties that may produce a predictable, wide-
spread surplus of food under conducive
ecological conditions. These activities are
primarily commercial fishing and domestic
livestock production.
With the trophic theory of money we can
readily recognise that real GDP and money
supplies indicate the amount of agricultural
surplus, and in turn environmental impact.
Lots of agricultural surplus generates lots
of real money; no surplus generates no real
money. Limits to agricultural production,
therefore, mean limits to real money and
real GDP. Long before such limits may be
reached, major environmental impacts occur
and accrue.
