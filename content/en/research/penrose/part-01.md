## THE BASIC CONUNDRUM

Proposals for describing the initial state of the universe has a fundamental conundrum [1] -- the Second Law of thermodynamics. 

It says that the entropy or disorder of the universe increases with time. So it decreases backwards in time. 

 <!-- where the term “entropy” refers to an appropriate measure of disorder or lack of “specialness” of the state of the universe. Since the entropy increases in the future direction of time, it must decrease in the past time-direction.  -->

<!-- The universe's initial state is be the most special of all, so  -->

Any proposal for the nature of the universe's initial state must account for its extreme specialness. 

<!-- Proposals have been put forward from time to time (such as in various forms of “inflationary cosmology” and the previously popular “chaotic cosmology”) in which it is  -->

Inflationary models have suggested that the initial state was “random”. This is the conundrum. 

<!-- , and various physical processes are invoked in order to provide mechanisms whereby the universe might be driven into the special state in which it appears actually to have been in, at slightly later stages. But “random” means “non-special” in the extreme; hence the conundrum just referred to. -->

Sometimes theorists think that the early universe:
- was very “small” which allowed only a few alternative initial states, or 
- had the anthropic principle, which is a selection principle in favour of certain special initial states that allow the eventual evolution of intelligent life.

Neither of these suggested explanations gets close to resolving the issue, however. 

With time-symmetrical dynamical laws, the mere smallness of the early universe does not provide a restriction on its degrees
of freedom. 

For we may contemplate a universe model in the final stages of collapse. 

I expect it to collapse to some sort of complicated space-time singularity which has as many degrees of freedom as were already present in its earlier non-singular collapsing phase.

Time-reversing this situation, we see that an initial singular state could also contain as many degrees of freedom as such a collapsing one. 

But in our actual universe, almost all of those degrees of freedom were somehow not activated.

What about the anthropic principle? 

<!-- Again, this is
virtually no help to us whatever in resolving our conundrum. It is normally assumed that  -->

Life arose via complicated evolutionary processes which required particular conditions and particular physical laws, including the Second Law. 

The Second Law says that the universe more special at an earlier stage when life was not present. 

From the purely anthropic point of view, this earlier far more special phase was not needed; it would have been much more likely that our present “improbable” stage came about simply by chance, rather than coming about via an earlier even more improbable stage. 

When the Second Law is a crucial component, there is always a far more probable set of initial conditions that would lead to this same state of affairs, namely one in which the Second Law was violated prior to the situation now!

As another aspect of this same issue, we may think of the vastness of our actual universe, most of which had no actual bearing on our existence. 

Though very special initial conditions were indeed required for our existence in our particular spatial location, we did not actually need these same special conditions at distant places in the universe. Yet as we look out at the universe, we see the same kind of conditions, acting according to the same Second Law of thermodynamics, no matter how far out we look. 

If we take the view that the Second Law was introduced in our vicinity merely for our own benefit, then we are left with no explanation for the extravagance of this same Second Law having to be invoked uniformly throughout the universe, as it appears to be as far as our powerful instruments are able to probe.


## THE ENORMITY OF THE SPECIALNESS

In order to stress the extraordinary scale of this
problem, and the intrinsic implausibility of explanations
of this kind, it is helpful to enter a little more precisely
into the definition of entropy, and to estimate the entropy
magnitudes that we have to contend with. Boltzmann
provided us with a beautiful formula for the entropy S of a
system:

S = k log V.

Here k is Boltzmann’s constant and V is the volume of a
certain region in the total phase space P of the system
under consideration. We are assuming P to be “coarse-
grained” into sub-regions, each sub-region representing
states that are deemed to be indistinguishable with regard to any reasonable macroscopic parameter. (There is
clearly an element of arbitrariness or subjectivity, here, as
to which parameters are to be regarded as
macroscopically discernible and which are deemed to be
effectively “unmeasurable”.

In practice, there is a
considerable robustness with regard to this arbitrariness,
and it is reasonable to disregard this issue in the present
discussion.) Any particular state of the system under
consideration will be specified by some point x of P, and
the quantity V is then the volume of the particular sub-
region of P which contains x.

With regard to future time-evolution of the system, the
Second Law can be understood as the fact that, as the
system evolves, the point x moves within P so that with
overwhelming probability it enters sub-regions of
successively larger and larger volume V. This arises from
the fact that, in practice, the sub-regions differ
stupendously in size. 

The logarithm in Boltzmann’s
formula helps here (as does the smallness of k, in ordinary
units), because there need only be a modest increase in S
when x moves from one sub-region into a neighbouring
one of stupendously larger volume. But this is only the
easy half of our understanding of the Second Law. The
difficult half is to understand why, when we reverse time,
x enters successively tinier sub-regions of P. It does this
because it has ultimately to reach the exceptionally tiny
region B which represents the Big Bang itself. The
difficult half of the Second Law involves an
understanding of why the universe had to start off in such
an extraordinarily special state. And to understand how
special the Big Bang actually was, we need to compare
the volume of B with that of the entire phase space P.

One point of concern is the fact that the entire volume
might be infinite, as it certainly would be in the case of a
spatially infinite universe. This issue, while of relevance,
is not of major importance for our considerations here.
There is also the issue of how we get a finite phase-space
volume when some of the parameters would be describing
continuous fields. I shall evade this latter issue by
assuming that it is dealt with by quantum mechanics,
where for a finite universe of bounded energy content we
may assume only finitely many quantum states.

To deal with a spatially infinite universe, I shall assume
that we need consider only, say, that comoving portion of
the universe that intersects our past light cone. This
contains something of the order of 1080 baryons. To
obtain a lower bound for the volume of P, for this
situation, we can consider the entropy that arises when
this number of baryons is collapsed into a black hole. For
this, we use the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy formula
SBH=8π2kGm2/hc for a spherical black hole of mass m and
find a value of the order of 10123. 

If we collapsed the dark
matter also into this black hole, we would get a
considerably larger entropy (and, for a continually
expanding universe, we should consider even larger
values than this), but this value represents a usable lower
bound. Recalling the logarithm in Boltzmann’s formula (a
natural logarithm, but that is of no concern), we get that
2760
the volume of P is greater than that of B by a factor that
exceeds
123
1010 .

This gives us some idea of the enormity of the precision
in the Big Bang!


THE GEOMETRIC NATURE OF THE SPECIALNESS

A seeming paradox arises from the fact that our best
evidence for the very existence of the Big Bang arises
from observations of the microwave background
radiation—frequently referred to as the “flash of the Big
Bang”, greatly cooled down to its present value of ~2.7K.
The intensity of this radiation, as a function of frequency,
matches the Planck radiation formula extraordinarily
closely, giving us impressive evidence of an early
universe state with matter in thermal equilibrium. But
thermal equilibrium is represented, in phase space P, as
the coarse-graining sub-region of largest volume (so large
that it normally exceeds all others put together). 

This
corresponds to maximum entropy, so we reasonably ask:
how can this be consistent with the Second Law,
according to which the universe started with a very tiny
entropy?

The answer lies in the fact that the high entropy of the
microwave background refers only to the matter content
of the universe and not to the gravitation field, as would
be encoded in its space-time geometry in accordance with
Einstein’s general relativity. What we find, in the early
universe, is an extraordinary uniformity, and this can be
interpreted as the gravitational degrees of freedom that
are potentially available to the universe being not excited
at all. As time progresses, the entropy rises as the initially
uniform distribution of matter begins to clump, as the
gravitational degrees of freedom begin to be taken up.

This allows stars to be formed, which become much
hotter than their surroundings (a thermal imbalance that
all life on Earth depends upon), and finally this
gravitational clumping leads to the presence of black
holes (particularly the huge ones in galactic centres),
which represent an enormous increase in entropy.

Although, in general, there is no clear geometric
measure of the entropy in a gravitational field in general
relativity, we can at least provide proposals for the non-
activation of gravitational degrees of freedom at the Big
Bang. I have referred to such a proposal as the Weyl
Curvature Hypothesis (WCH) [2]. 

In Einstein’s theory the
Ricci curvature Rab is directly determined by the
gravitational sources, via the energy-momentum tensor of
matter (analogue of the charge-current vector Ja in
Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory) and the remaining part
of the space-time Riemann curvature, namely the Weyl
curvature Cabcd, describes gravitational degrees of
freedom (analogue of the field tensor Fab of Maxwell’s
theory). WCH—which is a time-asymmetrical
hypothesis—asserts that initial space-time singularities
09 Opening, Closing and Special Presentations
03 Special PresentationProceedings of EPAC 2006, Edinburgh, Scotland
must be constrained to have Cabcd=0 (in some appropriate
sense), whereas final space-time singularities (as occur
inside black holes) are unconstrained.

What appears to be the most satisfactory form of WCH
has been studied extensively by Paul Tod [3]. This
proposes that an initial space-time singularity can always
be represented as a smooth past boundary to the
conformal geometry of space-time. In conformal
geometry, we consider the space-time structure that is
invariant under rescalings of the metric
gab → ĝab = Ω2 gab
where Ω is taken to be a smooth positive scalar field on
space-time. Another way of specifying the conformal
geometry of space-time is simply to take the family of
null cones (in the tangent spaces of the space-time points)
as defining the geometry. It may be noted that the
conformal structure contains 9 out of the 10 components
of the metric, the overall scale providing, in effect, the
10th.

Tod’s formulation of WCH is the hypothesis that we
can adjoin a (past-spacelike) hypersurface boundary to
space-time in which the conformal geometry can be
mathematically extended smoothly through it, to the past
side of this boundary. This amounts to “stretching” the
metric by a conformal factor Ω which becomes infinite at
the Big Bang singularity, so that we get a smooth metric
ĝab which actually extends across this boundary.

CONFORMAL CYCLIC COSMOLOGY

So far, we regard the conformal “space-time” prior to
the Big Bang as a mathematical fiction, introduced solely
in order to formulate WCH in a mathematically neat way.
However, my “outrageous” proposal [4] is to take this
mathematical fiction seriously as something physically
real. But what “physical reality” can we consistently
attach to this space-time occurring “before the Big
Bang”? As a clue to this possibility, we should consider
the nature of the physics that is presumed to be taking
place just after the Big Bang. (I am going to ignore the
possibility of inflation here, and assume that such
exponential expansion did not actually take place after the
Big Bang. The issue of inflation, in relation to this
scheme, is considered in the section on physical
implications, below.) As we approach the Big Bang,
moving back in time, we expect to find temperatures that
are increasingly great. 

And the greater the temperature,
the more irrelevant the rest masses of the particles
involved will become, so these particles are effectively
massless near the Big Bang. Now, massless particles (of
whatever spin) satisfy conformally invariant equations
[5]. I am going to suppose that the interactions between
these massless entities are also described by conformally
invariant equations. (This seems to be consistent with
current understanding of particle physics.) With such
conformal invariance holding in the very early universe,
the universe has no way of “building a clock”. So it loses track of the scaling which determines the full space-time
metric, while retaining its conformal geometry.
We may apply considerations of this kind also to the
distant future of the universe.

If we assume that in the
very remote future, conformally invariant equations again
govern the universe’s contents, then we can apply the
same mathematical trick as before, but now in the reverse
sense that we look for a boundary at which the conformal
factor Ω becomes zero, rather than infinite. This amounts
to using a metric, such as ĝab above, in which the future
infinity is “squashed down” to be a finite boundary to
space-time, which is conformally regular in the sense that
the space-time can be mathematically extended across this
future boundary as a smooth conformal manifold [5]. If
we also assume that there is a positive cosmological
constant present, as current observations appear to point
strongly towards, then we find that this future conformal
boundary is spacelike.

There is, however, a crucial difference between the use
of a conformal boundary to study the future asymptotics
of a space-time and Tod’s use of a conformal boundary to
treat the Big Bang. For in the latter case the very validity
of this trick provides a formulation of WCH, whereas it
the future situation of an expanding universe with
conformally invariant contents, the validity of this
procedure is more-or-less automatic [5]. Physically, we
may think that again in the very remote future, the
universe “forgets” time in the sense that there is no way to
build a clock with just conformally invariant material.
This is related to the fact that massless particles, in
relativity theory, do not experience any passage of time.
We might even say that to a massless particle, “eternity is
no big deal”. So the future boundary, to such an entity is
just like anywhere else. With conformal invariance both
in the remote future and at the Big-Bang origin, we can
try to argue that the two situations are physically
identical, so the remote future of one phase of the
universe becomes the Big Bang of the next. This
suggestion is my “outrageous” conformal cyclic
cosmology” (CCC) [4].

PHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS

There are certain important assumptions involved in
CCC, in order that only conformally invariant entities
survive to eternity . One of these is that black holes will
all eventually evaporate away and disappear. This
evaporation is a consequence of Stephen Hawking’s
quantum considerations, and these are now normally
accepted. 

There is, however, the issue (connected with the
so-called “information paradox”) of whether they would
actually ultimately disappear or leave some form of
“remnant”. I am here taking the more conventional view
that they would indeed disappear in a final
(cosmologically very mild) explosion. More serious, for
CCC, is how to get rid of massive fermions and massive
charged particles. It is not too unconventional to assume
that protons will ultimately decay, or even that there is
one variety of neutrino that is massless, but the real problem lies with electrons. A good many of them will
annihilate with positively charged particles, but there will
be a relatively small number of “stray” charged particles
which become trapped in their ultimate event horizons,
being unable to come in contact with other particles of
opposite charge. There are various possible ways out of
this, none of which is part of conventional particle
physics. 

One possibility is that electric charge is not
exactly conserved, so that within the span of eternity,
electric charge would eventually disappear. A much more
satisfying possibility, from my own perspective, is that
the electron’s mass will eventually decay away—and,
again, there is all of eternity for this to happen, so the
possibility may not be too outrageous to contemplate.
This last possibility is tied up with the issue of the
strength of the gravitational interaction, which I have
postponed in my discussion here. In the background of
conformal geometry, the strength of gravity may be
considered as being infinitely large at the Big Bang
(which is, in a sense, why the gravitational degrees of
freedom must initially be set to zero), and this strength
gets smaller as time progresses, eventually reducing to
zero at the final boundary. To express all this in a
satisfactory mathematical framework for CCC, we need
to reformulate general relativity in a conformally
invariant way. This can indeed be done. 

We take
advantage of the fact that the Weyl tensor Cabcd is
conformally invariant, and provides a precise measure of
the conformal curvature of space-time. We can define the
gravitational “spin-2 field” Kabcd to be described by Cabcd
with respect to the original space-time metric gab, but
when we pass to the conformally related metric ĝab=Ω2gab
we find that, curiously, Kabcd picks up a factor of Ω−1,
which Cabcd does not [5].

This has the implication that gravitational radiation
(described by Kabcd) actually survives at the future
boundary (whereas Cabcd vanishes there) and its presence
shows up as a non-zero normal derivative of Cabcd at the
boundary. This gives rise to density fluctuations at the
Big bang, and possibly primordial gravitational radiation.

The details of all this have yet to be worked out, but, in
principle at least, there should be clear-cut predictions
which should be observable. 

One important issue is how
this compares with the detailed observations of
temperature variations in the microwave background and
the near scale-invariance of the initial density
fluctuations. This scale invariance is normally taken as a
success of inflationary theory. It will be interesting to see
whether CCC leads to a similar implication with regard to
these fluctuations, as it also involves an exponential
expansion, though this occurs before the Big Bang in
CCC, rather than afterwards.
