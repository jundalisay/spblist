The structuralist emphasis on language as “a system where everything holds together” is conceptually, at least, a direct outgrowth of the concern for organic form in Humboldtian linguistics. 

For Humboldt, a language is not to be
regarded as a mass of isolated phenomena – words, sounds, individual speech
productions, etc. – but rather as an “organism” in which all parts are intercon-
nected and the role of each element is determined by its relation to the gen-
erative processes that constitute the underlying form. In modern linguistics,
with its almost exclusive restriction of attention to inventories of elements and
fixed “patterns” the scope of “organic form” is far more narrow than in the
Humboldtian conception. But within this more narrow frame, the notion of
“organic interconnection” was developed and applied to linguistic materials in a
way that goes far beyond anything suggested in Humboldt. For modern struc-
turalism, the dominant assumption is that “a phonological system [in particular]
is not the mechanical sum of isolated phonemes, but an organic whole of which
the phonemes are the members and of which the structure is subject to laws.”52
These further developments are familiar, and I will say nothing more about
them here.

As noted above, the form of language, for Humboldt, embraces the rules of
syntax and word formation as well as the sound system and the rules that
determine the system of concepts that constitute the lexicon. He introduces a
further distinction between the form of a language and what he calls its
“character.” It seems to me that, as he employs this term, the character of a
language is determined by the manner in which it is used, in particular, in poetry
and philosophy; and the “inner character” (p. 208) of a language must be
distinguished from its syntactic and semantic structure, which are matters of
form, not use. “Without changing the language in its sounds, and still less in its

forms and laws, time, through a growing evolution of ideas, a heightened power
of thought, and a more deeply penetrating capacity for feeling, will often bring
into a language what it did not formerly possess” (p. 116; Humboldt 1999:
86–7). Thus a great writer or thinker can modify the character of the language
and enrich its means of expression without affecting its grammatical structure.
The character of a language is closely related to other elements of the national
character and is a highly individual creation. For Humboldt, as for his Cartesian
and romantic precursors, the normal use of language typically involves creative
mental acts; but it is the character of a language rather than its form that reflects
true “creativity” in a higher sense – in the sense that implies value as well as
novelty.
For all his concern with the creative aspect of language use and with form as
generative process, Humboldt does not go on to face the substantive question:
what is the precise character of “organic form” in language. He does not, so far
as I can see, attempt to construct particular generative grammars or to determine
the general character of any such system, the universal schema to which any
particular grammar conforms. In this respect, his work in general linguistics
does not reach the levels achieved by some of his predecessors, as we shall see
directly. His work is also marred by unclarity regarding several fundamental
questions, in particular, regarding the distinction between the rule-governed
creativity which constitutes the normal use of language and which does not
modify the form of the language at all and the kind of innovation that leads to a
modification in the grammatical structure of the language. These defects have
been recognized and, to some extent, overcome in more recent work.
Furthermore, in his discussion of generative processes in language it is often
unclear whether what he has in mind is underlying competence or performance –
Aristotle’s first or second grade of actuality of form (De Anima, book II, chap. 1).
This classical distinction has been reemphasized in modern work. See note 2, and
references given there. The concept of generative grammar, in the modern sense,
is a development of the Humboldtian notion of “form of language” only if the
latter is understood as form in the sense of “possession of knowledge” rather than
“actual exercise of knowledge,” in Aristotelian terms. (See note 39.)
It should, incidentally, be noted that the failure to formulate rules of sentence
construction in a precise way was not simply an oversight of Cartesian linguis-
tics. To some extent it was a consequence of the express assumption that the
sequence of words in a sentence corresponds directly to the flow of thought, at
least in a “well-designed” language,53 and is therefore not properly studied as
part of grammar. In the Grammaire générale et raisonnée it is maintained that,
except for the figurative use of language, there is little to be said in grammar
regarding rules of sentence construction (p. 145). In Lamy’s rhetoric, shortly
after, omission of any discussion of “the order of words and the rules that must
be observed in the composition of speech” is justified on the grounds that “the 

natural light shows so vividly what must be done” that no further specification is
necessary (p. 25).54 At about the same time, Bishop Wilkins55 distinguishes
those constructions that are merely “customary” (take one’s heels and fly away,
hedge a debt, be brought to heel, etc.) from those which follow the “natural
sense and order of the words” and therefore need no special discussion (p. 354);
for example, the arrangement of Subject, Verb, and Object, or Subject, Copula,
and Adjective, or the ordering of “grammatical” and “transcendental” particles
relative to the items they govern, etc. (p. 354).
At the opposite pole from the belief in “natural order” is the view that each
language contains an arbitrary collection of “patterns” learned through constant
repetition (and “generalization”) and forming a set of “verbal habits” or “dis-
positions.” The belief that language structure and language use can somehow be
described in these terms underlies much of the modern study of language and
verbal behavior, often coupled with a denial of the possibility of useful
cross-linguistic generalizations in syntax (see pp. 57–58, above). Like the
reliance on a presumed natural order, it has helped foster a neglect of the problem
of specifying the “grammatical form” of particular languages or the general
abstract schema to which each language must conform.56
In summary, one fundamental contribution of what we have been calling
“Cartesian linguistics” is the observation that human language, in its normal
use, is free from the control of independently identifiable external stimuli or
internal states and is not restricted to any practical communicative function, in
contrast, for example, to the pseudo language of animals. It is thus free to serve
as an instrument of free thought and self-expression. The limitless possibilities
of thought and imagination are reflected in the creative aspect of language use.
Language provides finite means but infinite possibilities of expression con-
strained only by rules of concept formation and sentence formation, these being
in part particular and idiosyncratic but in part universal, a common human
endowment. The finitely specifiable form of each language – in modern terms,
its generative grammar (cf. note 39) – provides an “organic unity” interrelating
its basic elements and underlying each of its individual manifestations, which
are potentially infinite in number.
The dominant view throughout this period is that “languages are the best
mirror of the human mind.”57 This virtual identification of linguistic and mental
processes is what motivates the Cartesian test for the existence of other minds,
discussed above. It finds expression throughout the romantic period. For
Friedrich Schlegel, “Mind and language are so inseparable, thought and word
are so essentially one, that, just as certainly as thoughts are considered to be the
characteristic privilege of humankind, we can call the word, in accordance with
its inner meaning and dignity, the original essence of man.”58 We have already
made reference to Humboldt’s conclusion that the force that generates lan-
guage is indistinguishable from that which generates thought. Echoes of this

conclusion persist for some time,59 but they become less frequent as we enter
the modern period.


The association of language and mind is regarded differently in the earlier and later phases of the period under review.

The earlier view is that the structure of language reflects the nature of thought so closely that “the science of language differs hardly at all from that of thought” (Beauzée, p. x)60; the creative aspect of language use is accounted for on the
basis of this assumption.61 On the other hand, the observation that language
serves as a medium of thought begins to be rephrased as the view that language
has a constitutive function with respect to thought. 

La Mettrie, for example, in discussing how the brain compares and relates the images that it discerns,
concludes that its structure is such that, once the signs of objects and their
differences “have been traced or imprinted on the brain, the soul necessarily
examines their relations62 – an examination that would have been impossible
without the discovery of signs or the invention of language” (op. cit., p. 105);
prior to the discovery of language, things could only be perceived in a vague or
superficial way. We have already referred to Humboldt’s view that “Man lives
primarily with objects, indeed, since feeling and acting in him depend on his
presentations [Vorstellungen], he actually does so exclusively, as language
presents them to him” (op. cit., p. 74; Humboldt 1999: 60). Under the impact
of the new relativism of the romantics, the conception of language as a con-
stitutive medium for thought undergoes a significant modification, and the
notion that language difference can lead to differences, even incomparability
in mental processes, is explored.63 This development, however, is not part of
our main theme; its modern elaboration is familiar, and I will discuss it no
further here.
