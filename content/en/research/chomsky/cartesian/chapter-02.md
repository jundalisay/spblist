We have observed that the study of the creative aspect of language use develops
from the assumption that linguistic and mental processes are virtually identical,
language providing the primary means for free expression of thought and
feeling, as well as for the functioning of the creative imagination. Similarly,
much of the substantive discussion of grammar, throughout the development of
what we have been calling “Cartesian linguistics,” derives from this assump-
tion. The Port-Royal Grammar, for example, begins the discussion of syntax
with the observation that there are “three operations of our minds: conceiving,
judging, and reasoning” (p. 27), of which the third is irrelevant to grammar (it is
taken up in the Port-Royal Logic, which appeared two years later, in 1662).
From the manner in which concepts are combined in judgments, the Grammar
deduces what it takes to be the general form of any possible grammar, and it
proceeds to elaborate this universal underlying structure from a consideration of
“the natural manner in which we express our thoughts” (p. 30).64 Most sub-
sequent attempts to develop a schema of universal grammar proceed along the
same lines.
James Harris’s Hermes, which does not bear the imprint of the Port-Royal
Grammar to the extent usual in eighteenth-century work, also reasons from the
structure of mental processes to the structure of language, but in a somewhat
different way. In general, he maintains, when a man speaks, “his Speech or
Discourse is a publishing of some Energie or Motion of his soul” (p. 223).65 The
“powers of the soul” are of two general types: perception (involving the senses
and the intellect) and volition (the will, passions, appetites –” all that moves to
Action whether rational or irrational” (p. 224). It follows that there are two kinds
of linguistic acts: to assert, that is, “to publish some Perception either of the
Senses or the Intellect”; or to “publish volitions,” that is, to interrogate, com-
mand, pray, or wish (p. 224). The first type of sentence serves “to declare
ourselves to others”; the second, to induce others to fulfill a need. Continuing in
this way, we can analyze the volitional sentences in terms of whether the need is
“to have some perception informed” or “some volition gratified” (the inter-
rogative and requisitive modes, respectively); the requisitive is further analyzed
as imperative or precative, depending on whether the sentence is addressed to


inferiors or non-inferiors). Since both interrogatives and requisitives serve “to
answer to a need,” both types “require a return” – a return in words or deeds, to
the requisitive, and in words alone, to the interrogative (p. 293f.).66 Thus the
framework for the analysis of types of sentences is provided by a certain
analysis of mental processes.
Pursuing the fundamental distinction between body and mind, Cartesian
linguistics characteristically assumes that language has two aspects. In partic-
ular, one may study a linguistic sign from the point of view of the sounds that
constitute it and the characters that represent these signs or from the point of
view of their “signification,” that is, “the manner in which men use them for
signifying their thoughts” (Port-Royal Grammar, p. 41). Cordemoy announces
his goal in similar terms: “in this discourse I make a precise survey of everything
that speech [la Parole] derives from the soul and everything it borrows from the
body” (Discours physique de la parole, Preface). Similarly, Lamy begins his
rhetoric by distinguishing between “the soul of words” (that is, “their mental
[spiritual] aspect,” “what is particular to us” – the capacity of expressing “our
ideas”) from “their body” – “their corporeal aspect,” “what the birds that imitate
the voices of men have in common with us,” namely, “the sounds, which are
signs of their ideas” (De L’art de parler).
In short, language has an inner and an outer aspect. A sentence can be studied
from the point of view of how it expresses a thought or from the point of view of
its physical shape, that is, from the point of view of either semantic interpreta-
tion or phonetic interpretation.
Using some recent terminology, we can distinguish the “deep structure” of a
sentence from its “surface structure.” The former is the underlying abstract struc-
ture that determines its semantic interpretation; the latter, the superficial organiza-
tion of units which determines the phonetic interpretation and which relates to the
physical form of the actual utterance, to its perceived or intended form. In these
terms, we can formulate a second fundamental conclusion of Cartesian linguistics,
namely, that deep and surface structures need not be identical. The underlying
organization of a sentence relevant to semantic interpretation is not necessarily
revealed by the actual arrangement and phrasing of its given components.
This point is brought out with particular clarity in the Port-Royal Grammar,
in which a Cartesian approach to language is developed for the first time, with
considerable insight and subtlety.67 The principal form of thought (but not the
only one – cf. p. 79 below) is the judgment, in which something is affirmed of
something else. Its linguistic expression is the proposition, the two terms of
which are the “subject, which is that of which one affirms” and the “predicate,
which is that which is predicated” (p. 29; PRG 67). The subject and the attribute
may be simple, as in “Earth is round”, or complex [composé], as in “An able
magistrate is a man useful to the republic” or “Invisible God created the visible
world.” Furthermore, in such cases as these, the propositions 


contain, at least in our mind, several judgments, from which one can make as many
propositions. Thus, for example, when I say “Invisible God created the visible world”
three judgments that pass through my mind are included in this proposition. For I judge:
(1) that God is invisible;
(2) that He created the world;
(3) that the world is visible;
and of these three propositions, the second is the principal and essential one of the
original proposition. But the first and the third are only subordinate, and comprise only
part of the principal proposition – the first composing its subject, the third its predicate.
(p. 68; PRG 99–100)
In other words, the deep structure underlying the proposition “Invisible God
created the visible world” consists of three abstract propositions, each express-
ing a certain simple judgment, although its surface form expresses only the
subject-attribute structure. Of course, this deep structure is implicit only; it is not
expressed but is only represented in the mind:
Now these subordinate propositions are often in our mind, without being expressed in
words, as in the example cited [viz. “Invisible God created the visible world”]. (p. 68;
PRG 100)
It is sometimes possible to express the deep structure in a more explicit way, in
the surface form, “as when I reduce the above example to these terms: ‘God
WHO is invisible created the world WHICH is visible’” (pp. 68–69; PRG 100).
But it constitutes an underlying mental reality – a mental accompaniment to the
utterance – whether or not the surface form of the utterance that is produced
corresponds to it in a simple, point-by-point manner.
In general, constructions of a noun with a noun in apposition, an adjective, or
a participle are based on a deep structure containing a relative clause: “all these
modes of speech include the relative pronoun in their meaning, and may be
resolved by using it” (p. 69; PRG 100). The same deep structure may be realized
differently in different languages, as when Latin has “video canem currentem,”
and French “Je voy un chien qui court” (pp. 69–70; PRG 100). The position of
the relative pronoun in the “subordinate proposition” [proposition incidente] is
determined by a rule that converts deep structure to surface structure. We see
this, for example, in such phrases as “God whom I love” and “God by whom the
world has been created.” In such cases,
the relative pronoun is always placed at the beginning of the proposition (although,
according to the meaning it ought to be only at the end), unless it is governed by a
preposition, for the preposition comes first, at least ordinarily. (p. 71; PRG 101)
In the case of each of the sentences just discussed, the deep structure consists
of a system of propositions, and it does not receive a direct, point-
by-point expression in the actual physical object that is produced. To form an
actual sentence from such an underlying system of elementary propositions, we 

apply certain rules (in modern terms, grammatical transformations). In these
examples, we apply the rule preposing the relative pronoun that takes the place
of the noun of the incident proposition (along with the preposition that precedes
it, if there is one). We may then, optionally, go on to delete the relative pronoun,
at the same time deleting the copula (as in “Dieu invisible”) or changing the
form of the verb (as in “canis currens”). Finally, we must, in certain cases,
interchange the order of the noun and the adjective (as in “un habile
magistrat”).68
The deep structure that expresses the meaning is common to all languages, so
it is claimed, being a simple reflection of the forms of thought. The transforma-
tional rules that convert deep to surface structure may differ from language to
language. The surface structure resulting from these transformations does not
directly express the meaning relations of the words, of course, except in the
simplest cases. It is the deep structure underlying the actual utterance, a
structure that is purely mental, that conveys the semantic content of the sen-
tence. This deep structure is, nevertheless, related to actual sentences in that
each of its component abstract propositions (in the cases just discussed) could
be directly realized as a simple propositional judgment.
The theory of essential and incident propositions as constituent elements of
deep structure is extended in the Port-Royal Logic69 with a more detailed
analysis of relative clauses. There, a distinction is developed between explica-
tive (nonrestrictive or appositive) and determinative (restrictive) relative
clauses. The distinction is based on a prior analysis of the “comprehension”
and “extension” of “universal ideas,”70 in modern terms, an analysis of meaning
and reference. The comprehension of an idea is the set of essential attributes that
define it, together with whatever can be deduced from them; its extension is the
set of objects that it denotes:
The comprehension of an idea is the constituent parts which make up the idea, none of
which can be removed without destroying the idea. For example, the idea of a triangle is
made up of the idea of having three sides, the idea of having three angles, and the idea of
having angles whose sum is equal to two right angles, and so on.
The extension of an idea is the objects to which the word expressing the idea can be
applied. The objects which belong to the extension of an idea are called the inferiors of
that idea, which with respect to them is called the superior. Thus, the general idea of
triangle has in its extension triangles of all kinds whatsoever. (p. 51; PRL 39–40)
In terms of these notions, we can distinguish such “explications” as “Paris,
which is the largest city in Europe” and “man, who is mortal” from “determi-
nations” such as “transparent bodies, wise men” or “a body which is trans-
parent, men who are pious” (pp. 59–60, 118; PRL 44–45, 89):
A complex expression is a mere explication if either (1) the idea expressed by the
complex expression is already contained in the comprehension of the idea expressed 

by the principal word of the complex expression, or (2) the idea expressed by the
complex expression is the idea of some accidental characteristic of all the inferiors of
an idea expressed by the principal word. (pp. 59–60; PRL 45)
A complex expression is a determination if the extension of the idea expressed by
the complex term is less than the extension of the idea expressed by the principal
word. (p. 60; PRL 45)
In the case of an explicative relative clause, the underlying deep structure
actually implies the judgment expressed by this clause, when its relative
pronoun is replaced by its antecedent. For example, the sentence “men, who
were created to know and love God, ...” implies that men were created to know
and love God. Thus an explicative relative clause has the essential properties of
conjunction. But in the case of a restrictive relative clause (a determination), this
is obviously not true. Thus in saying “Men who are pious are charitable,” we do
not affirm either that men are pious or that men are charitable. In stating this
proposition,
we form a complex idea by joining together two simple ideas – the idea of man and the
idea of piety – and we judge that the attribute of being charitable is part of this complex
idea. Thus the subordinate clause asserts nothing more than that the idea of piety is not
incompatible with the idea of man. Having made this judgment we then consider what
idea can be affirmed of this complex idea of pious man. (p. 119; PRL 89–90)
Similarly, consider the expression “The doctrine which identifies the sovereign
good with the sensual pleasure of the body, which was taught by Epicurus, is
unworthy of a philosopher.”71 This contains the subject “The doctrine which ...
taught by Epicurus” and the predicate “unworthy of a philosopher.” The subject
is complex, containing the restrictive relative clause “which identifies the
sovereign good with the sensual pleasure of the body” and the explicative
relative clause “which was taught by Epicurus.” The relative pronoun in the
latter has as its antecedent the complex expression “the doctrine which identifies
the sovereign good with the sensual pleasure of the body.” Since the clause
“which was taught by Epicurus” is explicative, the original sentence does imply
that the doctrine in question was taught by Epicurus. But the relative pronoun of
the restrictive clause cannot be replaced by its antecedent, “the doctrine,” to
form an assertion implied by the full sentence. Once again, the complex phrase
containing the restrictive relative clause and its antecedent expresses a single
complex idea formed from the two ideas of a doctrine and of identifying the
sovereign good with the sensual pleasure of the body. All this information must
be represented in the deep structure of the original sentence, according to the
Port-Royal theory, and the semantic interpretation of this sentence must proceed
in the manner just indicated, utilizing this information (pp. 119–120; PRL 90).
A restrictive relative clause is based on a proposition, according to the
Port-Royal theory, even though this proposition is not affirmed when the 

relative clause is used in a complex expression. What is affirmed in an expres-
sion such as men who are pious, as noted above, is no more than the compat-
ibility of the constituent ideas. Hence in the expression “minds which are square
are more solid than those which are round,” we may correctly say that the
relative clause is “false,” in a certain sense, since “the idea of being square” is
not compatible with “the idea of mind understood as the principle of thought”
(p. 124; PRL 93).
Thus sentences containing explicative as well as restrictive relative clauses
are based on systems of propositions (that is, abstract objects constituting the
meanings of sentences);72 but the manner of interconnection is different in the
case of an explicative clause, in which the underlying judgment is actually
affirmed, and a determinative clause, in which the proposition formed by
replacing the relative pronoun by its antecedent is not affirmed but rather
constitutes a single complex idea together with this noun.
These observations are surely correct, in essence, and must be accommodated
in any syntactic theory that attempts to make the notion “deep structure” precise
and to formulate and investigate the principles that relate deep structure to
surface organization. In short, these observations must be accommodated in
some fashion in any theory of transformational generative grammar. Such a
theory is concerned precisely with the rules that specify deep structures and
relate them to surface structures and with the rules of semantic and phonological
interpretation that apply to deep and surface structures respectively. It is, in
other words, in large measure an elaboration and formalization of notions that
are implicit and in part expressly formulated in such passages as those just
discussed. In many respects it seems to me quite accurate, then, to regard the
theory of transformational generative grammar, as it is developing in current
work, as essentially a modern and more explicit version of the Port-Royal
theory.
In the Port-Royal theory, the relative pronoun that occurs in the surface form
does not always have the dual function of standing for a noun and connecting
propositions. It may be “shorn of its pronominal nature” and may thus serve
only the latter role. For example, in such sentences as “I suppose that you will be
wise” and “I tell you that you are wrong” we find that, in the deep structure,
“these propositions, ‘you will be wise’, ‘you are wrong’, make up only part of
the whole propositions ‘I suppose ...’ and ‘I tell you ...’” (Grammaire, p. 73;
PRG 104–105).73
The Grammar goes on to argue that infinitival constructions play the same
role in the verbal system that relative clauses play in the nominal system,
providing a means for extending the verbal system through the incorporation
of whole propositions: “the infinitive is, among the other moods of the verb,
what the relative is among the other pronouns” (pp. 111–112; PRG 139); like the
relative pronoun, “the infinitive has, over and above the affirmation of the verb, 

the power to join the proposition in which it appears to another proposition”
(p. 112; PRG 139). Thus the meaning of “scio malum esse fugiendum” is
conveyed by a deep structure based on the two propositions expressed by the
sentences “scio” and “malum est fugiendum.” The transformational rule (in
modern terms) that forms the surface structure of the sentence replaces “est” by
“esse”, just as the transformations that form such sentences as “Dieu (qui est)
invisible a créé le monde (qui est) visible” perform various operations of
substitution, reordering, and deletion on the underlying systems of propositions.
“And from this has come the fact that in French we almost always render the
infinitive by the indicative of the verb and the particle ‘que’: ‘Je sais que le mal
est à fuir’” (p. 112; PRG 140). In this case, the identity of deep structure in Latin
and French may be somewhat obscured by the fact that the two languages use
slightly different transformational operations to derive the surface forms.
The Grammar goes on to point out that indirect discourse can be analyzed in
a similar way.74 If the underlying embedded proposition is interrogative, it is the
particle “if” rather than “that” that is introduced by the transformational rule, as
in “They asked me if I could do that,” where the “discourse which is reported” is
“Can you do that?” Sometimes, in fact, no particle need be added, a change of
person being sufficient, as in “He asked me: Who are you?” as compared with
“He asked me who I was” (p. 113; PRG 140–141).
Summarizing the Port-Royal theory in its major outlines, a sentence has an
inner mental aspect (a deep structure that conveys its meaning) and an outer,
physical aspect as a sound sequence. Its surface analysis into phrases may not
indicate the significant connections of the deep structure by any formal mark or
by the actual arrangement of words. The deep structure is, however, represented
in the mind as the physical utterance is produced. The deep structure consists of
a system of propositions, organized in various ways. The elementary proposi-
tions that constitute the deep structure are of the subject-predicate form, with
simple subjects and predicates (i.e., categories instead of more complex
phrases). Many of these elementary objects can be independently realized as
sentences. It is not true, in general, that the elementary judgments constituting
the deep structure are affirmed when the sentence that it underlies is produced;
explicative and determinative relatives, for example, differ in this respect. To
actually produce a sentence from the deep structure that conveys the thought
that it expresses, it is necessary to apply rules of transformation that rearrange,
replace, or delete items of the sentence. Some of these are obligatory, further
ones optional. Thus “God, who is invisible, created the world, which is visible”
is distinguished from its paraphrase, “Invisible God created the visible world,”
by an optional deletion operation, but the transformation that substitutes a
relative pronoun for the noun and then preposes the pronoun is obligatory.
This account covers only the sentences based exclusively on judgments. But
these, although the principal form of thought, do not exhaust the “operations of 


our minds,” and “one must still relate to what occurs in our mind the conjunc-
tions, disjunctions, and other similar operations of our minds, and all the other
movements of our souls, such as desires, commands, questions, etc.” (p. 29;
PRG 67). In part, these other “forms of thought” are signified by special
particles such as “and,” “not,” “or,” “if,” “therefore,” etc. (pp. 137–138; PRG
168). But with respect to these sentence types as well, an identity of deep
structure may be masked through divergence of the transformational means
whereby actual sentences are formed, corresponding to intended meanings. A
case in point is interrogation. In Latin, the interrogative particle ne “has no
object outside the mind, but only marks the movement of the soul, by which we
wish to know a thing” (p. 138; PRG 168). As for the interrogative pronoun, “it is
nothing more than a pronoun to which the signification of ‘ne’ is added; that is
to say, which, beyond taking the place of a noun like the other pronouns, further
marks this movement of the soul which desires to know something and which
demands to be instructed about it” (p. 138; PRG 168). But this “movement of
the soul” can be signified in various ways other than by the addition of a
particle, for example, by vocal inflection or inversion of word order, as
in French, where the pronominal subject is “transported” to the position
following the person marker of the verb (preserving the agreement of the
underlying form). These are all devices for realizing the same deep structure
(pp. 138–139; PRG 168–169).
Notice that the theory of deep and surface structure as developed in the
Port-Royal linguistic studies implicitly contains recursive devices and thus
provides for infinite use of the finite means that it disposes, as any adequate
theory of language must. We see, moreover, that, in the examples given, the
recursive devices meet certain formal conditions that have no a priori necessity.
In both the trivial cases (e.g., conjunction, disjunction, etc.) and the more
interesting ones discussed in connection with relatives and infinitives, the
only method for extending deep structures is by adding full propositions of a
basic subject-predicate form. The transformational rules of deletion, rearrange-
ment, etc., do not play a role in the creation of new structures. The extent to
which the Port-Royal grammarians may have been aware of or interested in
these properties of their theory is, of course, an open question.
In modern terms, we may formalize this view by describing the syntax of a
language in terms of two systems of rules: a base system that generates deep
structures and a transformational system that maps these into surface structures.
The base system consists of rules that generate the underlying grammatical
relations with an abstract order (the rewriting rules of a phrase-structure gram-
mar); the transformational system consists of rules of deletion, rearrangement,
adjunction, and so on. The base rules allow for the introduction of new
propositions (that is, there are rewriting rules of the form A → ...S..., where
S is the initial symbol of the phrase-structure grammar that constitutes the base); 

there are no other recursive devices. Among the transformations are those which
form questions, imperatives, etc., when the deep structure so indicates (i.e.,
when the deep structure represents the corresponding “mental act” in an appro-
priate notation).75
The Port-Royal grammar is apparently the first to develop the notion of
phrase structure in any fairly clear way.76 It is interesting, therefore, to notice
that it also states quite clearly the inadequacy of phrase-structure description for
the representation of syntactic structure and that it hints at a form of transforma-
tional grammar in many respects akin to that which is being actively studied
today.
Turning from the general conception of grammatical structure to specific
cases of grammatical analysis, we find many other attempts in the
Port-Royal Grammar to develop the theory of deep and surface structure.
Thus adverbs are analyzed as (for the most part) arising from “the desire that
men have to abbreviate discourse,” thus as being elliptical forms of
preposition-noun constructions, for example, “wisely” for “with wisdom” or
“today” for “on this day” (p. 88; PRG 121). Similarly, verbs are analyzed as
containing implicitly an underlying copula that expresses affirmation; thus,
once again, as arising from the desire to abbreviate the actual expression of
thought. The verb, then, is “a word whose principal use77 is to signify affirma-
tion or assertion, that is, to indicate that the discourse where this word is
employed is the discourse of a man who not only conceives things, but who
judges and affirms them” (p. 90; PRG 122). To use a verb, then, is to perform the
act of affirming, not simply to refer to affirmation as an “object of our thought,”
as in the use of “a number of nouns which also mean affirmation, such as
‘affirmans’ and ‘affirmatio’” (p. 90; PRG 122). Thus the Latin sentence “Petrus
vivit” has the meaning “Peter is living” (p. 90; PRG 123), and in the sentence
“Petrus affirmat” “‘affirmat’ is the same as ‘est affirmans’” (p. 98; PRG 128).
It follows, then, that in the sentence “Affirmo” (in which subject, copula, and
attribute are all abbreviated in a single word), two affirmations are expressed:
one regarding the act of the speaker in affirming, the other the affirmation that
he attributes (to himself, in this case). Similarly, “the verb ‘nego’ ... contains an
affirmation and a negation” (p. 98; PRG 128).78
Formulating these observations in the framework outlined above, what the
Port-Royal grammarians are maintaining is that the deep structure underlying a
sentence such as “Peter lives” or “God loves mankind” (Logic, p. 108; PRL 83)
contains a copula, expressing the affirmation, and a predicate (“living,” “loving
mankind”) attributed to the subject of the proposition. Verbs constitute a sub-
category of predicates; they are subject to a transformation that causes them to
coalesce with the copula into a single word.
The analysis of verbs is extended in the Logic, where it is maintained (p. 117)
that, despite surface appearances, a sentence with a transitive verb and its object 

“expresses a complex proposition and in one sense two propositions.” Thus we
can contradict the sentence “Brutus killed a tyrant” by saying that Brutus did not
kill anyone or that the person whom Brutus killed was not a tyrant. It follows
that the sentence expresses the proposition that Brutus killed someone who was
a tyrant, and the deep structure must reflect this fact. It seems that this analysis
would also apply, in the view of the Logic, if the object is a singular term; e.g.,
“Brutus killed Caesar.”
This analysis plays a role in the theory of reasoning developed later on in the
Logic. It is used to develop what is in effect a partial theory of relations,
permitting the theory of the syllogism to be extended to arguments to which it
would otherwise not apply. Thus it is pointed out (pp. 206–207; PRL 159–160)
that the inference from “The divine law commands us to honor kings” and
“Louis XIV is a king” to “The divine law commands us to honor Louis XIV” is
obviously valid, though it does not exemplify any valid figure as it stands,
superficially. By regarding “kings” as “the subject of a sentence contained
implicitly in the original sentence,” using the passive transformation79 and
otherwise decomposing the original sentence into its underlying prepositional
constituents, we can finally reduce the argument to the valid figure Barbara.
Reduction of sentences to underlying deep structure is resorted to elsewhere
in the Logic, for the same purpose. For example, Arnauld observes (p. 208; PRL
160) that the sentence There are few pastors nowadays ready to give their lives
for their sheep, though superficially affirmative in form, actually “contains
implicitly the negative sentence ‘Many pastors nowadays are not ready to
give their lives for their sheep.” In general, he points out repeatedly that what
is affirmative or negative “in appearance” may or may not be in meaning, that is,
in deep structure. In short, the real “logical form” of a sentence may be quite
different from its surface grammatical form.80
The identity of deep structure underlying a variety of surface forms in
different languages is frequently stressed, throughout this period, in connection
with the problem of how the significant semantic connections among the
elements of speech are expressed. Chapter VI of the Port-Royal Grammar
considers the expression of these relations in case systems, as in the classical
languages, or by internal modification, as in the construct state in Hebrew, or by
particles, as in the vernacular languages, or simply by a fixed word order,81 as in
the case of the subject–verb and verb–object relations in French. These are
regarded as all being manifestations of an underlying structure common to all
these languages and mirroring the structure of thought. Similarly, Lamy com-
ments in his rhetoric on the diverse means used by various languages to express
the “relations, and the consequence and interconnexion between all the ideas
that the consideration of things excites in our mind” (De L’Art de Parler,
pp. 10–11). The encyclopedist Du Marsais also stresses the fact that case
systems express relations among the elements of discourse that are, in other 


languages, expressed by word order or specific particles, and he points out the
correlation between freedom to transpose and wealth of inflection.82
Notice that what is assumed is the existence of a uniform set of relations into
which words can enter, in any language, these corresponding to the exigencies
of thought. The philosophical grammarians do not try to show that all languages
literally have case systems, that they use inflectional devices to express these
relations. On the contrary, they repeatedly stress that a case system is only one
device for expressing these relations. Occasionally, they point out that case
names can be assigned to these relations as a pedagogic device; they also argue
that considerations of simplicity sometimes may lead to a distinction of cases
even where there is no difference in form. The fact that French has no case
system is in fact noted in the earliest grammars. Cf. Sahlin, p. 212.
It is important to realize that the use of the names of classical cases for
languages with no inflections implies only a belief in the uniformity of the
grammatical relations involved, a belief that deep structures are fundamentally
the same across languages, although the means for their expression may be quite
diverse. This claim is not obviously true – it is, in other words, a nontrivial
hypothesis. So far as I know, however, modern linguistics offers no data that
challenge it in any serious way.83
As noted above, the Port-Royal theory of grammar holds that for the most
part, adverbs do not, properly speaking, constitute a category of deep structure
but function only “for signifying in a single word what could otherwise be
indicated only by a preposition and a noun” (p. 88; PRG 121). Later grammar-
ians simply drop the qualification to “for the most part.” Thus for Du Marsais,
“what distinguishes adverbs from other kinds of words is that adverbs have the
value of a preposition and a noun, or a preposition with its complement: they are
words which abbreviate” (p. 660). This is an unqualified characterization, and
he goes on to analyze a large class of items in this way – in our paraphrase, as
deriving from a deep structure of the form: preposition–complement. This
analysis is carried still further by Beauzée.84 He, incidentally, maintains that,
although an “adverbial phrase” such as “with wisdom” does not differ from the
corresponding adverb “wisely” in its “signification,” it may differ in the
“accessory ideas” associated with it: “when it is a matter of contrasting an
action with a habit, the adverb is more appropriate for indicating the habit and
the adverbial phrase for indicating the action; thus I would say ‘A man who
conducts himself wisely cannot promise that all his actions will be performed
with wisdom’” (p. 342).85 This distinction is a particular case of “the antipathy
that all languages naturally show towards a total synonymity, which would
enrich an idiom only with sounds that do not subserve accuracy and clarity of
expression.”
Earlier grammarians provide additional instances of analysis in terms of deep
structure, as, for example, when imperatives and interrogatives are analyzed as, 

in effect, elliptical transforms of underlying expressions with such supplemen-
tary terms as “I order you ...” or “I request...”86 Thus “Come see me” has the
deep structure “I order/beg you to come see me”; “Who found it?” has the
meaning of “I ask who found it?” etc.
Still another example that might be cited is the transformational derivation of
expressions with conjoined terms from underlying sentences, in the obvious
way; for example, in Beauzée, op. cit., pp. 399f. Beauzée’s discussion of
conjunctions also provides somewhat more interesting cases, as, for example,
when he analyzes “how” [comment] as based on an underlying form with
“manner” [manière] and a relative clause, so that the sentence “I know how it
happened” has the meaning of “I know the manner in which it happened”; or
when he analyzes “the house which I acquired.” In this way, the underlying deep
structure with its essential and incident propositions is revealed.
An interesting further development, along these lines, is carried out by Du
Marsais in his theory of construction and syntax.87 He proposes that the term
“construction” be applied to “the arrangement of words in discourse,” and the term
“syntax,” to “the relations which words bear to one another.” For example, the three
sentences “accepi litteras tuas,” “tuas accepi litteras,” and “litteras accepi tuas”
exhibit three different constructions, but they have the same syntax; the relations
among the constituent elements are the same in all three cases. “Thus, each of these
three arrangements produces the same meaning [sens] in the mind: ‘I have received
your letter’.” He goes on to define “syntax” as “what brings it about, in every
language, that words produce the meaning we wish to arise in the minds of those
who know the language ... the part of grammar that provides knowledge of the
signs established in a language to produce understanding in the mind”
(pp. 229–231). The syntax of an expression is thus essentially what we have called
its deep structure; its construction is what we have called its surface structure.88
The general framework within which this distinction is developed is the
following. An act of the mind is a single unit. For a child, the “idea” [sentiment]
that sugar is sweet is at first an unanalyzed, single experience (p. 181); for the
adult, the meaning of the sentence “Sugar is sweet,” the thought that it
expresses, is also a single entity. Language provides an indispensable means
for the analysis of these otherwise undifferentiated objects. It provides a
means of clothing our thought, so to speak, of rendering it perceptible, of dividing it, of
analyzing it – in a word, of making it such that it is communicable to others with more
precision and detail.
Thus, particular thoughts are each an ensemble, so to speak, a whole that the usage of
language divides, analyzes and distributes into parts by means of different articulations
of the speech organs which form the words. (p. 184)
Similarly, the perception of speech is a matter of determining the unified and
undifferentiated thought from the succession of words. “[The words] work
together to produce the whole sense or the thought we wish to arise in the 

minds of those who read or hear them” (p. 185). To determine this thought, the
mind must first discover the relations among the words of the sentence, that is,
its syntax; it must then determine the meaning, given a full account of this deep
structure. The method of analysis used by the mind is to bring together those
words that are related, thus establishing a “meaningful order” [ordre significatif]
in which related elements are successive. The actual sentence may, in itself,
have this “meaningful order,” in which case it is called a “simple construction
(natural, necessary, meaningful, assertive)” (p. 232). Where it does not, this
“meaningful order” must be reconstructed by some procedure of analysis – it
must be “re-established by the mind, which grasps the meaning [sens] only by
this order” (pp. 191–192). To understand a sentence of Latin, for example, you
must reconstruct the “natural order” that the speaker has in his mind (p. 196).
You must not only understand the meanings of each word, but, furthermore,
you would not understand anything in it except by putting together in your mind the
words in their relation to one another, and you can do this only after you have heard the
whole sentence. (pp. 198–199)
In Latin, for example, it is the “relative word-endings which makes us consider
the words in the completed proposition in accordance with the order of their
interrelations, and hence in accordance with the order of the simple, necessary
and meaningful construction” (pp. 241–242). This “simple construction” is an
“order which is always indicated, but rarely observed in the usual construction
of languages whose nouns have cases” (p. 251). Reduction to the “simple
construction” is an essential first step in speech perception:
The words form a whole that has parts. The simple perception of the relations between
these parts makes us conceive the whole of them, and comes to us solely from the simple
construction. Setting forth the words in accordance with the order of succession of their
relations, this presents them in a manner that is best fitted to make us recognize these
relations and to make the whole thought arise. (pp. 287–288)
Constructions other than the “simple constructions” (namely, “figurative con-
structions” [constructions figurées])
are understood only because the mind corrects their irregularities, with the help of
accessory ideas which make us conceive what we read and hear as if the sense were
expressed in the order of the simple construction ... (p. 292)
In short, in the “simple construction” the relations of “syntax” are represented
directly in the associations among successive words, and the undifferentiated
thought expressed by the sentence is derived directly from this underlying
representation, which is regarded, throughout, as common to all languages
(and, typically, as corresponding to the usual order of French – cf., e.g., p. 193).
The transformations which form a “figurative construction” effect reordering
and ellipsis. The “fundamental principle of all syntax” (p. 218) is that reordering 

and ellipsis must be recoverable by the mind of the hearer (cf. pp. 202, 210ff.,
277); that is, they can be applied only when it is possible to recover uniquely
“the strict metaphysical order” of the “simple construction.”89
Many examples of reduction to simple constructions are presented to illus-
trate this theory.90 Thus the sentence “Who said it?” is reduced to the simple
construction “The one who said it is which person?” (Sahlin, p. 93); the
sentence “Being loved as much as lovers, you are not forced to shed tears” is
reduced to “Since you are loved as much as you are lovers, ...”; the sentence “It
is better to be just than to be rich, to be reasonable than to be wise” is reduced to
four underlying propositions, two negative, two positive, in the obvious way
(p. 109), etc.
A rather different sort of example of the distinction between deep and surface
structure is provided by Du Marsais in his analysis (pp. 179–180) of such
expressions as “I have an idea/fear/doubt,” etc. These, he says, should not be
interpreted as analogous to the superficially similar expressions “I have a book/
diamond/watch,” in which the nouns are “names of real objects that exist
independently of our thought [manière de penser].” In contrast, the verb in
“I have an idea” is “a borrowed [empruntée] expression,” produced only “by
imitation.” The meaning of “I have an idea” is simply “I am thinking” or “I am
conceiving something in such-and-such a way.” Thus the grammar gives no
license for supposing that such words as “idea,” “concept,” “image” stand for
“real objects,” let alone “perceptible objects.” From this grammatical observa-
tion it is only a short step to a criticism of the theory of ideas, in its Cartesian and
empiricist forms, as based on a false grammatical analogy. This step is taken by
Thomas Reid, shortly after.91
As Du Marsais indicates with abundant references, his theory of construction
and syntax is foreshadowed in scholastic and renaissance grammar (see note
67). But he follows the Port-Royal grammarians in regarding the theory of deep
and surface structure as, in essence, a psychological theory, not merely a means
for the elucidation of given forms or for analysis of texts. As indicated above, it
plays a role in his hypothetical account of the perception and production of
speech, just as, in the Port-Royal Grammar, the deep structure is said to be
represented “in the mind” as the utterance is heard or produced.
As a final example of the attempt to discover the hidden regularities under-
lying surface variety, we may mention the analysis of French indefinite articles
in Chapter VII of the Port-Royal Grammar, where it is argued, on grounds of
symmetry of patterning, that de and des play the role of the plural of un, as in Un
crime si horrible mérite la mort, Des crimes si horribles méritent la mort, De si
horribles crimes méritent la mort, etc. To handle the apparent exception, Il est
coupable de crimes horribles (d’horribles crimes), they propose the “rule of
cacophony” that a de de sequence is replaced by de. They also note the use of
des as a realization of the definite article, and other uses of these forms. 


Perhaps these comments and examples are sufficient to suggest something of
the range and character of the grammatical theories of the “philosophical
grammarians.” As noted above, their theory of deep and surface structure relates
directly to the problem of creativity of language use, discussed in the first part of
the present work.
From the standpoint of modern linguistic theory, this attempt to discover and
characterize deep structure and to study the transformational rules that relate it
to surface form is something of an absurdity;92 it indicates lack of respect for the
“real language” (i.e., the surface form) and lack of concern for “linguistic fact.”
Such criticism is based on a restriction of the domain of “linguistic fact” to
physically identifiable subparts of actual utterances and their formally marked
relations.93 Restricted in this way, linguistics studies the use of language for the
expression of thought only incidentally, to the quite limited extent to which deep
and surface structure coincide; in particular, it studies “sound-meaning corre-
spondences” only in so far as they are representable in terms of surface
structure. From this limitation follows the general disparagement of Cartesian
and earlier linguistics,94 which attempted to give a full account of deep structure
even where it is not correlated in strict point-by-point fashion to observable
features of speech. These traditional attempts to deal with the organization of
semantic content as well as the organization of sound were defective in many
ways, but modern critique generally rejects them more for their scope than for
their failures.
