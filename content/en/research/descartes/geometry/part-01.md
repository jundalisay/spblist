<!-- **Notice.**

Until now, I have endeavored to make myself understandable to everyone, but for  -->

This treatise can only be understood by those who are familiar with Geometry. 

<!-- Because these books contain many well-demonstrated truths, I have thought it unnecessary to repeat them and have nonetheless made use of them. -->

<!-- **GEOMETRY.**

**BOOK ONE.** -->

<!-- Problems that can be constructed using only circles and straight lines. -->

All Geometry problems can be easily reduced to such terms that it is only necessary to know the lengths of certain straight lines to construct them.

<!-- **How arithmetic calculation relates to geometric operations.** -->

All Arithmetic is composed of only four or five operations:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Extraction of roots

The last can be considered as a type of Division.

Similarly, in Geometry, one only needs to add or subtract lines to or from the lines being sought to make them known.

Or having one line, which I will call unity to better relate it to numbers, and which can usually be chosen at will, then having 2 other lines, find a 4th line that is to one of these two as the other is to unity, which is the same as Multiplication.

Or find a 4th line that is to one of these 2 as unity is to the other, which is the same as Division.

Or finally, find one, two, or several mean proportionals between unity and some other line, which is the same as extracting the square root, or cube root, etc.

 <!-- And I will not hesitate to introduce these arithmetic terms into Geometry to make myself more understandable. -->

### Multiplication

For example, let `AB` be unity.

Suppose it is necessary to multiply `BD` by `BC`.

I have only to join points `A` and `C`, then draw `DE` parallel to `CA`.

`BE` is the product of this Multiplication.


### Division

To divide `BE` by `BD`, having joined points `E` and `D`, I draw `AC` parallel to `DE``, and `BC` is the result of this division.


### Extraction of the square root

Or if it is necessary to extract the square root of `GH`, I add to it in a straight line `FG`, which is unity, and divide `FH` into two equal parts at point `K`.

From center `K`, I draw the circle `FIH`, then raise from point `G` a straight line to `I`, at right angles to `FH`, and GI is the root sought. I say nothing here of the cube root or others, because I will discuss them more conveniently later.


## How one can use numbers in Geometry

But often we do not need to actually draw these lines on paper.

We can designate them by a few letters, each by a single one.

As to add the line `BD` to `GH`, I name the one and the other, and write ; 

And , to subtract from ; 

And , to multiply one by the other; And , to divide by ; And or to multiply by itself; 

And , to take the square root of ; And , to take the cube root of , and so on.

Where it is to be noted that by or or the like, I ordinarily conceive only of simple lines, though to use the names in common use in Algebra, I call them squares or cubes, etc.

All the parts of the same line should ordinarily be expressed by as many dimensions one as the other, when the unit is not determined in the question, as here contains as many as or of which the line I have named is composed: 


But this is not the same when the unit is determined, because it can be understood by implication wherever there are too many or too few dimensions: as if we have to extract the cube root of , we must think that the quantity is divided once by the unit, and that the other quantity is multiplied twice by the same.

Moreover, in order not to fail to remember the names of these lines, a separate register must always be made of them, as they are introduced or changed, writing for example:

AB , that is, AB equal to .

GH BD , etc.
