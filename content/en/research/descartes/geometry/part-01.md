**Notice.**

Until now, I have endeavored to make myself understandable to everyone, but for this treatise, I fear it can only be read by those who are already familiar with what is found in the books of Geometry. Because these books contain many well-demonstrated truths, I have thought it unnecessary to repeat them and have nonetheless made use of them.

**GEOMETRY.**

**BOOK ONE.**

**On problems that can be constructed using only circles and straight lines.**

All Geometry problems can be easily reduced to such terms that it is only necessary to know the lengths of certain straight lines to construct them.

**How arithmetic calculation relates to geometric operations.**

And just as all Arithmetic is composed of only four or five operations, which are Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and the Extraction of roots, which can be considered a type of Division: similarly, in Geometry, one only needs to add or subtract lines to or from the lines being sought to prepare them to be known; or having one line, which I will call unity to better relate it to numbers, and which can usually be chosen at will, then having two other lines, find a fourth line that is to one of these two as the other is to unity, which is the same as Multiplication; or find a fourth line that is to one of these two as unity is to the other, which is the same as Division; or finally, find one, two, or several mean proportionals between unity and some other line, which is the same as extracting the square root, or cube root, etc. And I will not hesitate to introduce these arithmetic terms into Geometry to make myself more understandable.

**Multiplication.**

For example, let AB be unity, and suppose it is necessary to multiply BD by BC. I have only to join points A and C, then draw DE parallel to CA, and BE is the product of this Multiplication.

**Division.**

Or if it is necessary to divide BE by BD, having joined points E and D, I draw AC parallel to DE, and BC is the result of this division.

**Extraction of the square root.**

Or if it is necessary to extract the square root of GH, I add to it in a straight line FG, which is unity, and divide FH into two equal parts at point K. From center K, I draw the circle FIH, then raise from point G a straight line to I, at right angles to FH, and GI is the root sought. I say nothing here of the cube root or others, because I will discuss them more conveniently later.




**How one can use numbers in Geometry.**

But often we do not need to actually draw these lines on paper, and it is sufficient to designate them by a few letters, each by a single one. As to add the line BD to GH, I name the one and the other , and write ; And , to subtract from ; And , to multiply one by the other; And , to divide by ; And or to multiply by itself; And , to take the square root of ; And , to take the cube root of , and so on.

Where it is to be noted that by or or the like, I ordinarily conceive only of simple lines, though to use the names in common use in Algebra, I call them squares or cubes, etc.

It is also to be noted that all the parts of the same line should ordinarily be expressed by as many dimensions one as the other, when the unit is not determined in the question, as here contains as many as or of which the line I have named is composed: but this is not the same when the unit is determined, because it can be understood by implication wherever there are too many or too few dimensions: as if we have to extract the cube root of , we must think that the quantity is divided once by the unit, and that the other quantity is multiplied twice by the same.

Moreover, in order not to fail to remember the names of these lines, a separate register must always be made of them, as they are introduced or changed, writing for example:
AB , that is, AB equal to .
GH BD , etc.

How one must come to the Equations that serve to solve the problems.
Thus, wishing to solve some problem, one must first consider it as already done, and give names to all the lines that seem necessary to construct it, as well to those that are unknown, as to the others. Then, without considering any difference between these known and unknown lines, one must go through the difficulty, according to the order that most naturally shows in what way they depend mutually on each other, until one has found a way to express the same quantity in two ways: which is called an Equation; for the terms of one of these two ways are equal to those of the other. And one must find as many such Equations as one has assumed lines that were unknown. Or if there are not so many, and nevertheless nothing is omitted of what is desired in the question, this shows that it is not entirely determined. And then one can take at will known lines for all the unknowns to which no Equation corresponds. After that, if there are still several, one must use in order each of the remaining Equations, either by considering it alone, or by comparing it with the others, to explain each of these unknown lines; and thus unravel them, that only one remains, equal to some other that is known, or whose square, or cube, or square of square, or sursolid, or square of cube, etc. is equal to what results from the addition or subtraction of two or more other quantities, one of which is known, and the others are composed of some mean proportionals between the unit and that square, or cube, or square of square, etc. multiplied by other known ones. Which I write in this way.

That is, which I take for the unknown quantity, is equal to , or the square of is equal to the square of minus multiplied by , or the cube of is equal to multiplied by the square of plus the square of multiplied by minus the cube of , and so on.

And one can always thus reduce all unknown quantities to a single one, when the Problem can be constructed by circles and straight lines, or also by conic sections, or even by some other line that is only one or two degrees more composite. But I do not linger to explain this in more detail, because I would deprive you of the pleasure of learning it yourself, and the usefulness of cultivating your mind by exercising yourself in it, which is in my opinion the principal one that can be drawn from this science. Also, I do not find anything so difficult in it that those who will be a little versed in common Geometry and Algebra, and who will pay attention to all that is in this treatise, cannot find.
