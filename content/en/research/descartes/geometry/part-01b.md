How one must come to the Equations that serve to solve the problems.

Thus, wishing to solve some problem, one must first consider it as already done, and give names to all the lines that seem necessary to construct it, as well to those that are unknown, as to the others. 

Then, without considering any difference between these known and unknown lines, one must go through the difficulty, according to the order that most naturally shows in what way they depend mutually on each other, until one has found a way to express the same quantity in two ways: which is called an Equation; for the terms of one of these two ways are equal to those of the other.

One must find as many such Equations as one has assumed lines that were unknown.

Or if there are not so many, and nevertheless nothing is omitted of what is desired in the question, this shows that it is not entirely determined.

And then one can take at will known lines for all the unknowns to which no Equation corresponds. 

After that, if there are still several, one must use in order each of the remaining Equations, either by considering it alone, or by comparing it with the others, to explain each of these unknown lines; and thus unravel them, that only one remains, equal to some other that is known, or whose square, or cube, or square of square, or sursolid, or square of cube, etc. is equal to what results from the addition or subtraction of two or more other quantities, one of which is known, and the others are composed of some mean proportionals between the unit and that square, or cube, or square of square, etc. multiplied by other known ones. 

Which I write in this way.


That is, which I take for the unknown quantity, is equal to , or the square of is equal to the square of minus multiplied by , or the cube of is equal to multiplied by the square of plus the square of multiplied by minus the cube of , and so on.

And one can always thus reduce all unknown quantities to a single one, when the Problem can be constructed by circles and straight lines, or also by conic sections, or even by some other line that is only one or two degrees more composite. 

<!-- But I do not linger to explain this in more detail, because I would deprive you of the pleasure of learning it yourself, and the usefulness of cultivating your mind by exercising yourself in it, which is in my opinion the principal one that can be drawn from this science. 

Also, I do not find anything so difficult in it that those who will be a little versed in common Geometry and Algebra, and who will pay attention to all that is in this treatise, cannot find.
