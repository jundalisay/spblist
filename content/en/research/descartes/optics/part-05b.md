Being locked in the chamber `P` and looking at the white body `RST`, you must see the likeness of the objects `V, X, Y`. 

{{< i s="/graphics/bio/eye.jpg" a="Eye" >}}

Light is the movement or action that the sun or some other luminous body that pushes the fire-aether  that is within all transparent bodies.

It bounces off the red object `V`. It gains its red color by making the fire-aether turn in circles around their centers after hitting it.
- This creates 2 movements [as VF and V5] that makes `V` look red when they 
- The action of these two movements meet at point `R`.
<!-- the proportion that is required to make felt the color red;  -->


The white body `1` reflects `V` without changing it. This goes towards the eye through the pores of this body. Those pores are very delicate and perforated on all sides. This makes you see the point `R` as red.

Light also bounces off of:
- yellow object `X` towards `S`
- blue object `Y` towards `T`

From there it is carried towards the eye. It makes you see `S` as yellow and `T` as blue.

Thus the 3 points `R, S, T`, appear of the same colors, and keeping the same order as the three `V, X, Y`, clearly show their likeness.

<!-- That is to say, the curves of the crystalline, passing over the figure through the points 1, 2, 3, and 4, 5, 6, must all converge at the back of this eye, around the same point, and one must dispose its figure for this purpose. Those coming from different points must converge at different points. How colors are seen through a white paper that is on the back of this eye. -->


The perfection of this painting depends mainly on 3 things:

1. The pupil has some size

This will let several rays from each point of the object enter it.

<!-- For example, here `XB14S` 2, XC25S, XD36S, and as many others as can be imagined between these three, come from the single point X;  -->

- If the pupil were narrow, only a single ray could go to `RST` and would not have enough force.
- If the pupil were larger, but there were no refraction in the eye, the rays coming from the objects would spread out in all directions in `RST`.
  - The points `V, X, Y` would send 3 rays each towards `R`.
  - These would reflect from there together towards your eyes.
  - You would see point `R` as a medium color between red, yellow, and blue.

 <!-- from each point of the object could pass through it to each point of -->
<!-- It would not have enough force to reflect back into the room `P` towards your eyes.  each point of -->

<!-- and similarly for points S and T, towards which the same points V, X, Y would send their rays. And it would happen almost the same if the refraction in the eye were greater or less than it should be, because of the size of this eye: for, being too great, the rays coming, for example, from point X, would assemble before reaching S, like towards M; and, on the contrary, being too small, they would assemble only beyond, like towards P; so that they would touch the white body RST at several points, towards which other rays from other parts of the object would also come. -->


2. These rays must be refracted in the eye 

In this way, those coming from different points are gathered in different points on the white body `RST`

3. The small filaments `EN` and the inside of the skin `EF` are black and the room `P` is entirely dark.

In this way, no light comes from elsewhere to disturb the action of these rays.

If `EN`, `EF` were not black, then they would not absorb the light that comes against them. The rays that come from `RST` towards them could return from there
- those of `T` towards `S` and `R`
- those of `R` towards `T` and `S`
- those of `S` towards `R` and `T`

These would disturb the action of each other.

The same would happen also to the rays that come from the room `P` towards `RST`, if there were any other light in this room, other than those sent by the objects `V, X, Y`.

<!-- The images that are formed there have the likeness of the objects.
The white body RST, paper or translucent shell.
How the size of the pupil serves the perfection of these images.
The points X, B, I, 4, S (etc.) through which the luminous rays pass. -->
