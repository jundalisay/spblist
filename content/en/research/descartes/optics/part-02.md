How can we determine this refraction quantitatively?

To answer this, we must first explain reflection.

Suppose a ball is struck from `A` towards `B`. At `B` it meets the surface of the ground `CBE`, which prevents it from going further and causes it to be deflected.

- The ground is perfectly flat and hard.
- The ball always travels at a constant speed, both when it descends and rebounds upwards.

Where will it go?


### The Directional Force

**The force that causes the speed of the ball is different from the force that causes the direction of the ball.** That direction is determined by the position of the racket.

This directional force shows that this ball can be diverted by the encounter with the earth `CBE`.

Thus, `CBE` can change the direction that it had towards `B` without changing the force that gave its speed, since these are 2 different things.

This is why it does not have to stop at `B` before bouncing off to `F` as many of our Philosophers think. If it was stopped at `B` then there is nothing at `B` which can cause it to start again. 



The determination to move towards a certain side, as well as movement and generally any other kind of quantity, can be divided between all the parts that compose it.

A ball that moves from `A` to `D` is composed of 2 others:

1. A force which makes it fall from the line `AB` to the line `CD`
2. A force which makes it go from the left `AC` to the right `BD`

<!-- 1. A force which makes it fall from the line `AF` to the line `CE`
2. A force which makes it go from the left `AC` to the right `FE` 

These together lead it to `B` along the straight line `AB`.-->

These together lead it to `D` along the straight line `AD`.

The encounter with the earth can only prevent **one** of these two determinations, and not the other. 
- It prevents the one that made the ball fall from `AB` to `CD` because it occupies all the space that is below `CD`.

<!-- It prevents the one that made the ball fall from `AF` to `CE` because it occupies all the space that is below `CE`. -->
<!-- But why would it prevent the other, which made it advance towards the right hand, since it is in no way opposed to it in that sense?  -->


Let us draw a circle with center `B`, which passes through line `A` which is the path of the ball.


The ball would have travelled from in the same time from `B` to some point on the circle's circumference, as it travelled from `A` to `B`.

This is because we suppose that:
- all the points in the circle are as distant from `B` as `A` is.
- the ball's speed is always equally fast.*

To know where on this circle the ball must end up, let us draw 3 straight lines `AC`, `HB`, `FE` perpendicular to `CE`.
- The distance between `AC` and `HB` is the same as that between `HB` and `FE`. 



Assume that it will take the ball travelling rightwards the same time to go from point `A` to point `B` and from `B` to any point in the circle that touches line `FE`. In this case, it is `F` or `D`.

<!-- However, it is impossible for it to arrive at any point on the line `FE` at the same time as reaching any point on the circumference of the circle `AFD`, except at point `D` or `F`. This is because these are the only two points where they intersect each other.  -->

Thus, if the Earth prevents it from passing towards `D`, then it must go towards `F`.

This is how reflection occurs at an angle always equal to what is called *the angle of incidence*.


For example, if a ray coming from point `A` falls on point `B` on the flat mirror `CBE`, it reflects towards `F` in such a way that the angle of reflection `FBE` is neither greater nor smaller than the angle of incidence `ABC`.

<!-- A ball, propelled from `A` towards `B`, encounters at point `B`, not the surface of the earth, but a delicate and thin web CBE.  -->

<!-- If instead of a mirror, `CBE` were a thin web, then the ball has the force to break it and pass through, only losing half of its velocity. -->
