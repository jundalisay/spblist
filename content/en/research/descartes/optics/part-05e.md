The images of objects that form in the eye also pass to the brain.

The rays that come from object `V` touch the point `R`, the end of one of the small nerve fibers that originate from the spot 7 on the inner surface of the brain 789;

Those from the object `X` touch the point `S`, the end of another nerve fiber, whose beginning is at point `8`;

Those from the object `Y` touch another nerve fiber at point `T`, which corresponds to the spot on the brain marked `9`, and so on for the others.

Light is nothing else but a movement or action that causes some movement.

The rays that come from `V` to `R` have the force to move the entire nerve fiber `R7` and therefore the spot on the brain marked `7`.

Those that come from `X` to `S` have the force to move the entire nerve fiber `S8`, and even to move it in a different way than `R7`. This is because the objects `X` and `V` are of two different colors. And so, those that come from `Y` move the point `9`.



A painting 789 is formed once again, similar to the objects `V, X, Y`, on the inner surface of the brain that faces its concavities. 

 <!-- further to a certain small gland located approximately in the middle of these concavities, -->
From there [visual cortex], they are sent to the pineal gland which is the seat of common sense. 

It can sometimes pass from there through the arteries of a pregnant woman to a specific part of the child in her womb, and form these marks of envy that are admired by the Doctors.

 <!-- cause so much admiration among all  -->
