Our senses depend on media |  Light is a medium of the object, it does not represent the actual object




There is a difference between our sensation of light and the objects that we see.<!--  what is in the objects that produces that sensation -->

<!-- There can be a difference between our sensation[1] of light (i.e. the idea that is formed in our imagination through the intermediary of our eyes) and what is in the objects that produces that sensation in us (i.e. what is in the flame or in the sun that is called by the name of "light").  -->

<!-- Everyone knows that --> <!-- is persuaded that the ideas that are --> 

People say that the objects in our thought are totally like the physical objects which they come from. <!--  proceed, nevertheless I can see no reasoning that assures us that this is the case.  --> 


On the contrary, I note many experiences where this is not true.

I think that words do not resemble the things they signify. Yet they still <!--  do not cease for that reason to --> cause us to conceive of those things, often without our paying attention to:
- the sound of the words or
- their syllables. 

<!-- Thus it can happen that, after having heard a discourse, the sense of which we have very well understood, we might not be able to say in what language it was uttered.[2] Now, if  -->

Words come from <!--  signify nothing except by --> human convention. They cause us to conceive of things.  <!-- to which they bear no resemblance, why could not  -->

<!-- Similarly, Nature uses light to as a  have established a certain sign that would cause us to have the sensation of light, even though that sign in itself bore no similarity to that sensation? Nature has established laughter and tears in us to cause us to read joy and sorrow on the faces of men. -->

Our ears lets us hear the sound of the words.
Our eyes lets us see the faces of persons<!--  who laughs or cries -->. 

But it is our mind that gives us the meaning of those sounds and faces, having remembered what those sounds and that face signify<!-- , represents their meaning to us --> at the same time.[3] 

<!-- that signifies it -->

Our mind represents to us the idea of light each time the light-action touches our eye. <!-- But, rather than lose time in disputation, I would do better to adduce another example. -->

<!-- Do you think that, even when we do not pay attention to the meaning of words and hear only their sound, the idea of that sound, which forms in our thought, is anything like the object that is the cause of it?  -->

Sometimes, we hear words and get only their sounds, without paying attention to their meaning of those words. 
- This sound creates an idea in our thought. 
- This idea then resembles the original cause of those words. 

 <!-- and hear only their sound, the idea of that sound, which forms in our thought, is anything like the object that is the cause of it?  -->

A man opens his mouth, moves his tongue, forces out his breath.

In all these actions, I see nothing that is not very different from the idea of the sound that they cause us to imagine. 

<!-- ost philosophers assure us that --> 

Sound is a mere <!-- nothing other than a certain --> vibration of air that strikes against our ears. 

Thus, if our sense of hearing were to report to our mind the true image of its object, then it would have to cause us to conceive of the motion of the parts of air that then vibrate against our ears. 
<!-- Our he instead of causing us to conceive of sound,  -->

<!-- But, because not everyone will perhaps want to believe what the philosophers say, I will adduce another example. -->

Of all our senses, touch is the one least misleading and most certain. <!-- , so that, if I show you that even touch causes us to conceive many ideas that in no way resemble the objects that produce them, I do not think you will find it strange if I say that sight can do the same.  -->

Everyone knows the ideas of tickling and of pain. These are formed in our thought when we are touched. This tickling and pain feeling are different from those things touching us. 

If you pass a feather over the lips of a child who is falling asleep, and he perceives it, will he <!-- that someone is tickling him. -->[4] <!-- Do you think the idea of tickling that he --> conceive it as resembling anything in this feather?

A soldier returns from battle. <!-- ; during the heat of combat he could have been wounded without being aware of it. But now that --> As he begins to cool off, he feels pain and worries <!-- believes --> that he has been wounded. He finds that it <!-- A surgeon is called, the soldier's armor is removed, and he is examined. In the end, one finds that what he felt --> was nothing but a buckler which was caught under his armor pressing on him<!--  and making him uncomfortable -->.  If the image of the buckler appeared to his mind after feeling its pain, then he would not need to worry.<!--   in causing him to feel this strap, his sense of touch had impressed its image on his thought, there would have been no need of a surgeon to show him what he was feeling. -->

Likewise, the objects that we see is the same as how the touch of a feather causes tickles and the buckler causes pain. [Touch conveys the tickle, not the feather. It conveys the pain of the buckler, not the buckler.]

Similarly, the light is like this touch. It is different from the actual object that it comes from.  

<!-- Now, I see no reason that forces us to believe that what is in the objects from which the sensation of light comes to us is any more like that sensation than the actions of a feather and of a strap are like tickling and pain.  -->

<!-- Nevertheless, I have not adduced these examples to make you believe absolutely that this light is something different in the objects from what it is in our eyes, but only so that you will doubt it and so that, forbearing from being preoccupied by the contrary, you can now better examine with me what light is.
