There are several things to note concerning the planets. 

1. They all tend toward the center of the stellar gravitational territory that contains them. 

But they can never arrive at those centers since the sun and stars already occupy the center. 

Assume that `saturn` follows the orbit of the air-aether at orbit `K` 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/fggf.jpg" alt="The solar system" >}}

- If `saturn` had a bit more force to continue its motion in a straight line relative to the air-aether around it, then it would go farther towards outer orbit `Y`

<!-- , making it farther from the `sun`, instead of always following circle `K`. -->

- From there, `saturn` would move more towards `F` the faster and smaller the air-aether are at `Y` compared to `K`.
- Those air-aether at `Y` will give more force to `saturn` to make it pass beyond `F` without stopping, and enter into another territory.
- Instead of being a planet, it would become a comet.

No planet can stop anywhere in that vast space between orbit `K` and the circumference of the heaven `FGGF` through which the comets pass. 

The planets necessarily cannot have more force to continue their motion in a straight line than those of the air-aether at `K`, when those planets move with the same agitation along with these air-aether. 

All bodies that have more are comets.

At orbit `K`, planets have the same force as the surrounding air-aether. Those which have more force are comets. 



Assume that `saturn` has less force and are slower than the air-aether surrounding it.
- This makes the air-aether around it push it down towards the orbit of `jupiter`. 
- Once at the orbit of `jupiter`, `saturn` will stay in that orbit if its speed and force matches that of the surrounding air-aether. 

<!-- become as strong or as fast as the air-aether in that orbit. -->

<!-- - This is because this air-aether there is more agitated than those at `K` [the orbit of `saturn`].
  - They will also offer less resistance because they are smaller.  -->

<!-- In this case, `saturn` will remain perfectly balanced in the orbit of `jupiter`. -->

<!-- - from there take its course in the same direction as they about the sun, without being at one time or another more or less distant from the sun, except insofar as they can also be more or less distant from it. -->

But if `saturn` were at the orbit of `jupiter` and has even less force or speed than the air-aether there, it will again be pushed by the air-aether closer to the sun near the orbit of `mars`.
- This will continue until it is in an orbit where its force and speed matches that of the surrounding air-aether. 


Thus, there are diverse planets at varying distances from the sun:
- Saturn
- Jupiter
- Mars
- Earth
- Venus
- Mercury.

Of these, the lowest and least massive can reach to the sun's surface. 

But the highest or farthest can never pass beyond orbit `K`.

 <!-- which, although very large in comparison with each planet in particular, is nevertheless so extremely small in comparison with the whole of heaven `FGGF` that it can be considered as its center. -->

Orbit `K` is so small compared to the total territory of the solar system. You could think of orbit `K` as the middle area of the solar system. 

The air-aether beyond orbit `K` or Saturn are much smaller than the planets. Yet they have more force than the planets. 

This is because this force does not depend solely on the quantity of matter in each body, but also on its surface area.

Assume that 2 bodies are moving equally fast. Body `A` has twice the density and size of body `B`.

If the surface area of Body `A` became larger, then it would become slower because it would meet more resitance. 

<!-- , then it has twice the agitation. 
- But it does not mean it has more force. 
- It means it has twice the surface area. 

This is because it will always meet as many other bodies resisting it, and it will have much less force to continue if its surface is much more than twice in extent. -->


<!--  as much matter as the other it also has twice the
amount of agitation, this is not to say thereby that it has twice the force
to continue to move in a straight line; 

but rather that it will have exactly 
twice as much if, in addition, its surface is exactly twice the extent,
because it will always meet twice  -->

<!-- , if one contains twice as much matter as the other, it also has twice as much agitation.** 
- **But it does not follow that it has twice as much force to continue to move in a straight line.** 
- It will only have twice the force if its surface is also twice than the other body.
  - This is because it will meet twice as many other bodies resisting it, and it will have much less force to continue if its surface is increased more than twice. -->



The air-aether particles are more or less completely spherical. 
- Spheres have the most matter within the least surface area.

The planets, on the other hand, are made up of earth-aether with very irregular shapes and sizes. 
- They have large surfaces relative to their density.


Thus, the planets can have:
- a greater area to volume ratio than most of these regular air-aether particles
- a smaller area to volume ratio than some of the smallest air-aether that are closest to the center of the territory.

Given 2 air-aether balls, the smaller ball will have more surface per matter than the large ball.

For example, make 3 clay balls.
- Ball 1 and 2 have the same amount of clay, but Ball 2 is compressed to half the size of Ball 1. 
  - Ball 2 would roll farther than Ball 1
- Ball 3 will have much less amount of clay packed into a much smaller ball
  - Ball 3 would not roll farther than Ball 1 
- Ball 1 can move farther the more it is compressed and less farther the less it is compressed

This is why of the planets within orbit `K`:
- are at varying distances from the `sun`
- the ones at the outer parts have the largest size, and the most solid and massive cores
