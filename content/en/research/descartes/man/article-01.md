### 1. Men have a soul and a body.

<!-- These men will be composed, like us, of a soul and a body.  -->

<!-- ; and I must first describe to you the body separately, then the soul also separately, and finally I must show you how these two natures must be joined and united to compose men who resemble us. -->

<!-- ## Body -->

<!-- nothing other than a statue or -->

### 2. The body is a machine of earth which God forms on purpose to make it as similar to us as possible. 

He gives its outside the color and shape of all our members, but he also puts on its inside the color and shape of our bodies.

These parts make the body walk, eat, breathe, and finally imitate all those of our functions which can be imagined to proceed from matter, and depend only on the disposition of the organs.

<!-- He not only gives it on the outside the color and figure of all our members, but also puts inside all the parts required to  -->


We see clocks, artificial fountains, mills, and other similar machines which, being made only by men, do not fail to have the power to move by themselves in many different ways.

It seems to me that I cannot imagine so many kinds of movement in this one, which I suppose to be made by the hands of God, nor attribute to it so much artifice, that you do not have reason to think that there may be even more.


I will not describe the large parts of the body such as:
- the bones
- the nerves
- the muscles
- the veins
- the arteries
- the stomach
- the liver
- the spleen
- the heart
- the brain
- and their parts

 <!-- nor all the other various parts of which it must be composed; -->

 <!-- for I suppose them at all similar to the parts of our body which have the same names, and which you can have shown to you by some learned anatomist, at least those which are large enough to be seen. -->

I will explain instead the small parts which are invisible because of their smallness. These small parts are known by the movements that they cause. Each of these movements serve a function.

 <!-- and for those which, because of their smallness, , I will be able to make them known to you more easily and more clearly by speaking to you of the movements which depend on them; so that it is only necessary that I explain these movements in order, and that I tell you by the same means which of our functions they represent.  -->

<!-- of this machine -->


### 3. The meats are digested in the stomach through the force of certain liquors

These liquors slip between their particles, separate, agitate, and heat them just as:
- common water does the same to quicklime, or
- strong water does for metals.

These liquors, brought from the heart by the arteries, become very hot.

The meats could even corrode and heat up by themselves, just as new hay does in the barn when it is squeezed before it is dry.

The small particles of these meats receive agitation as they heat up.

This combines with the heat of the stomach and the intestines that contain them.
- These intestines are composed of small threads.
- These are arranged to use the heat to digest food


The food then descends little by little towards the conduit through which the coarser parts of them must leave.
- This prevents the bran from following it. 

These subtler parts of the meats are uneven and still imperfectly mixed together. 
- These make up a liquor which is hollow and whitish when unmixed with blood

But a part of it mingles incontinently with the mass of blood in all the branches of the 'portal vein'.
- This vein receives this liquor from the intestines.
- It sends this liquor to the liver then to the heart through the vena cava vein 

<!-- ), and in the liver, as well as in a single vessel. -->

The pores of the liver make the entering liquor more subtle so that it elaborates itself.
- It takes on its color and acquires the form of blood.
- This is similar to the juice of black grapes, which is white, converts into clear wine when it is left to ferment on the grater.

This blood in the veins leaves the liver only through one way that also leads it into the right side of the heart.


## The Heart

The flesh of the heart contains in its pores one of those lightless fires.
- This makes it so hot and burning. 

 <!-- of which I have spoken above, which -->

As blood enters any of the 2 chambers in it, it swells rapidly and expands.
- This is similar to pouring milk drop by drop into a very hot vessel.

The fire in the heart dilates, warms, and subtilises the blood which falls in continuously drop by drop through a pipe of the vena cava in its right cavity from where it exhales in the lung. 

From there it goes to what is called by anatomists as the vein of the lung 'venous Yart√®re' from where it is distributed to the body.
<!-- , in its other concavity, rare-->


### 4. The flesh of the lung is so soft and decompressed 

It is always refreshed by the air of the breath. 

The vapors of the blood come out of the right cavity of the heart and enter the flesh of the lungs to be thickened and converted into blood again.

From there, they fall drop by drop into the left cavity of the heart, where they serve as fuel for the fire in the heart.

<!-- if they entered without being thus thickened again, they would not be sufficient to serve as food for the fire which is there. -->

Respiration serves only to thicken these vapors to maintain this fire.

<!-- , than is that which is in us for the preservation of our life, at least in those of us who are formed men:  -->


Babies who are still in their mothers' wombs cannot draw any fresh air by breathing. They have 2 conduits which make up for this defect:

1. One through which the blood of the vena cava passes into the vein called the artery

2. The other through which the vapors or rarefied blood of the artery called the vein are exhaled and go into the great artery
