When the blood is:
- purer and finer and effervesces more quickly, the nerves in the throat get excited with the sensation of pleasure.
- opposite of the above, it will produce the sensation of sadness. 

<!-- From these things it is clearly evident what is found in that machine that presents itself to the other internal senses that are inherent in us.  -->
