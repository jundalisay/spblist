### 19. Convexity and refraction is how the light coming from objects can enter through the pupil

<!-- looking at that part of the eye -->

<!-- Convexity, which affects the marked part BCB of the first tunic, and refraction, which occurs therein, is the reason why rays 

, so that the soul with an unmoving eye can perceive a greater number of objects than if the eye were not convex in that part.  -->

<!-- PBKQ -->
If the ray `YFT` were not refracted at point `B`, it could not pass through section `FF` and go to the optic nerve.

Refraction occurs in the crystalline humor. It strengthens and clarifies vision.

The structure of that humor is composed in such a way that it corresponds exactly to:
- the refractions that occur in other parts of the eye, and
- the distances of the objects. 

Hence, in direct vision to a certain point, all rays emanating from that point are accurately collected in a certain point of the retina or optic nerve of the eye.

By the same reasoning, it prevents any rays coming from elsewhere from falling on that part of the nerve. 

<!-- R  RN S  RL S T, X -->
For example, the crystalline humor looks at point `X`.
- The rays `X1S` and `X3S` etc. are accurately gathered at point `S`. 

Similarly, this arrangement of the crystalline humor prevents rays coming from points `V, Y`, etc. from reaching it. 

It collects all the rays of point `V` around point `R` and all the rays of point `Y` around point `T`. The same reasoning applies to the others. 

But if there were no refraction in the eye, the object `X` would affect only one of its rays at point `S`, with the rest scattered throughout the space `R` and `T`. 

Similarly, points `V` and `Y`, and all other intermediate points, would only send one of their rays to point `S`.

Object `X` can act more strongly on the nerve at point `S` by sending more rays to it.

<!-- , than if it only affected it with a single ray.  -->

That part of the nerve `S` will convey the action [light] of that object `X` more distinctly and faithfully to the brain, since it receives rays from it alone, than if it received them from many. 

The black color of both the concave surface of the membrane `EF` and of the filaments `E4` also renders vision more distinct. 

Black dulls, darkens, and prevents the power of the rays reflected from the back of the eye to the front. This prevents them from causing confusion of rays there. 

For example, the rays of object `Y` tend to point `T` in the whitish nerve. 
- These are reflected from there to `N` and `F` in all directions.
- From there, they could be reflected to `S` and `V` and thereby disturb the actions of `R` and `T`, if bodies `E` and `F` were not black.

However, the change that occurs in the crystalline humor causes the images of more distant or nearer objects to be more distinctly painted on the back of the eye. 

<!-- For, as it was said in the second book (Dioptrics): `LN` -->


For example, assume that the humor `LN` has a shape that it can direct all the rays of point `R` to point `S`.
- At the same time, it cannot cause the rays of point `T`, which is nearer, or of point `X`, which is more distant, to impinge on it.
- But it will cause the ray `Tl` to go to `K` and `Tn` to `G`.

Conversely, that `Xl` tends towards `G` and `Xn` to `K`. And so on for the others.

So to represent the point distinctly, it is necessary to change the entire figure of the humor `LN` slightly and make it flatter or more obtuse.
