Dreams depend:
- partly on the irregularity of the force of the spirits emerging from the pineal gland
- partly on the impressions of memory that come to mind. 

Hence, they are the same as ideas.

These are formed in the imagination while daydreaming. 
- The difference is that the images formed by dreams can be more distinct and vivid than those produced by daydreams.
 <!-- of those who, while awake, invent dreams for themselves. -->

<!-- waking imagination. -->

This is why the same force may more easily open:
- certain channels, such as `2, 4, 6`, and
- certain pores, such as `a, b, c`.

{{< i s="/graphics/bio/fig_30.jpg" a="Asleep" c="The brain when asleep" >}}


These serve the formation of ideas when the surrounding parts of the brain are slack and pendulous,  as shown above compared to when all are tense, as shown below.

{{< i s="/graphics/bio/pineal.jpg" a="Brain" >}}


This is also why a sense-object that reaches the sleeping brain does not immediately form the same idea as when the person were awake. 
- Instead, it would form one far more remarkable, astonishing, and intensely affecting. 

For example, we might dream of:
- being pierced by a sword when we are really just bitten by a mosquito.
- ourselves buried under mountains if weighed down by our bedclothes.

During sleep, the brain's substance rests. 
- It has time to nourish and refresh itself, being irrigated with blood held in the small veins and arteries on its outer surface.

Thus, after its pores become somewhat clogged, the spirits no longer need the same force to expand and support the entire brain arch as they did before. 

This is like sails on a ship needing less wind to swell when damp than when dry.

During sleep, the repeatedly circulates to and from the heart to be purified.
- This replenishes the spirits and wakes up the body on its own accord.
- Conversely, the body will fall asleep after being awake for long.

During wakefulness, the brain's substance gradually becomes drier through the continuous action of the spirits, and its pores widen.

During digestion, the juice of the food mixes with the blood, making it thicker and producing fewer spirits.

I will not discuss:
- how the spirits are excited by:
  - noise, pain, and other actions that affect the brain's inner parts via the sensory organs
  - joy, anger, and similar passions
- how sleep is impeded by the drying of the air that makes the blood finer, or other such factors
- how sleepiness is indunced by silence, sadness, air humidity, and similar factors 
- how excessive blood loss, prolonged fasting, excessive wine, and other such excesses increases or decreases the force of the spirits depending on the body's temperament
  - How these can lead to excessive wakefulness or excessive sleep.
- how excessive wakefulness weakens the brain leading to a mad man
- how excessive sleep makes it sluggish like a dull man.

<!-- All these and similar phenomena can be easily inferred from what has already been explained. However, before beginning a description of the rational soul, let us briefly recall everything that has been said so far about our machine. Let us also note, first, that  -->


I have assumed no valves, coils, or other organs in Figures LI, LII, LIII, LIV, LV, LVI, and LVII, except those that can easily be demonstrated to be present both in us and in many animals.

 <!-- lacking reason.  -->

Those visible structures that can be clearly perceived have already been demonstrated by anatomists. 



There is sufficient evidence to prove:
- how the arteries bring spirits to the brain
- the differences between the brain's concave surface and its inner parts 
 <!-- is observable for those who examine these structures closely, removing all doubt. -->

The valves described are attached to the nerves at the entrance to the muscles.

 <!-- if they consider that nature has universally placed such mechanisms wherever substances typically enter the body but might attempt to exit again.  -->

Examples include:
- the heart's entrance
- the gallbladder
- the throat
- the larger intestines
- the main divisions or branches of all veins.

The brain is composed of many filaments woven together just as skin and flesh also consist of fibers and filaments.

This can also be observed in all plants. **And so having woven fibers is a characteristic of any body that grows and is nourished by the addition of particles from other bodies.**


I made a few other simple and general assumptions that are not directly perceivable.

These hard-to-perceive things are in contrast to the visible structures of our organs which are diversely complex.

This is why I have likely omitted many visible elements present in us than assumed anything invisible as absent. 

My description of these simle invisible things is consistent with Nature always using the simplest and easiest means.


### 36. The functions of the body are made possible by the heart

The functions of the body are:
- the digestion of food
- the pulse of the heart and arteries
- the nutrition and growth of the limbs
- respiration
- wakefulness and sleep
- the reception of light, sounds, smells, tastes, heat, and other similar qualities in the external sense organs
- the impression of ideas formed within the organ of common sense
- the preservation of these ideas in memory
- the internal movements of desire and passion
- the external movements of all the limbs

These follow in such harmony, both in response:
- to objects presented to the senses and
- to passions and impressions in memory
  - These are imitated as accurately as possible. 


<!-- , I say, naturally follow in our machine through -->
These functions happen through the simple disposition of the organs, just as the movements of a clock or other automatons occur through the arrangement of weights and gears. 

Hence, these movements are caused by the blood and the animal spirits in motion.

These are from the heat of the fire that constantly burns in its heart.

This fire is of the same nature as physical fire.

<!-- 35. Regarding quantum in relation to dreams: it depends partly on the inequality of the vital force, which can result from the spirits emanating from gland H; and partly on the impressions of memory that occur. These are by no means different from those ideas I mentioned earlier, which are often formed in the imagination of those who are awake and dream: except that the images formed in dreaming can be much more distinct and vivid than those formed by the waking mind. From this, the reason is sought why the same force may be more capable of opening tubes, such as 2, 4, 6, and pores like a, b, c, which serve to form ideas, when the brain surrounding them is relaxed and hanging loose; as one can see in Figure 50, compared to when all are tense, as shown in the previous figure. This same reasoning also shows that if the action of some object that stimulates the senses passes to the brain of a sleeper, it will not immediately form the same idea as it would in an awake person; instead, it will form a much more remarkable and astonishing one, which would affect the senses more intensely. For example, when sleeping, if pricked by a mosquito, we dream that we are pierced by a sword: Leffen â€“ Moyardum, p. 116. If we are less covered, we imagine we are entirely naked; if, however, we are slightly burdened with blankets, we think we are buried beneath mountains. During sleep, the substance of the brain rests and has time to nourish and refresh itself: for it is irrigated with blood flowing through veins and small arteries visible on its external surface. Thus, soon after the pores become more obstructed, the spirits no longer need the same force they previously required to expand and sustain the entire dome of the brain. Clearly, just as strong wind is not needed to swell the wet sails of a ship, but only for the dry ones, so, when the spirits are strengthened, the blood, which produces them by repeatedly circulating through the heart (as noted above), becomes purer: consequently, the mechanism of our body naturally awakens after a sufficient period of sleep. Similarly, the body will fall into sleep again after being sufficiently awake. During wakefulness, the substance of the brain gradually becomes drier through the continuous actions of the spirits, and the pores widen. Then, when eating, as usual, if food is found, hunger stimulating the process, the juice of the food, or chyle, mixes with the blood, making it thicker: and causing fewer spirits to be produced. I will not here discuss how noises, pains, or other actions that affect the internal parts of the brain via the intervention of the sensory organs may disturb sleep: nor how emotions such as joy, anger, and other passions that excite the spirits, or the drying of the air that makes the blood more subtle, and similar conditions, may impede sleep: nor how silence, sadness, humidity of the air, and similar factors may invite sleep: nor how excessive blood loss, prolonged fasting, excessive consumption of alcohol, and other similar excesses, which, according to the differences in temperaments, might increase or decrease the power of the spirits, could cause prolonged wakefulness or even excessive sleep: nor how excessive wakefulness weakens the brain and excessive sleep makes it heavier, leading to a machine that resembles madness or stupor: nor other similar endless phenomena: these, of course, are not difficult to discern from what has already been explained. But before I begin describing the rational soul, let us keep in mind everything said thus far about our mechanism. And let us consider, first, that I have not supposed any valves, spirals, or organs, as Figures LI, LII, LIII, LIV, LV, LVI, and LVII, except those which, being quite similar to what we find in animals lacking reason, can easily be demonstrated in both humans and other creatures. The structures in question, which are clearly perceptible by sight, have been clearly demonstrated by anatomists. Then, what I said about the way in which the arteries convey spirits to the brain and the difference between the concave surface of the brain and its internal parts: likewise, if everything is examined carefully, there are many signs that can be observed with the eyes, which remove all doubt. Nor can one justly doubt the valves I described, which are affixed to the nerves at the entrances to the muscles: if one considers that nature has implanted them by a general decree at all places in the body, through which a certain substance is ordinarily allowed to pass, and which could attempt to return, as in the entrance to the heart, bile ducts, throat, larger intestines, and in the principal divisions or branches of all veins. As for the brain, one cannot imagine a more rational composition than one made from numerous fibers, woven in various ways: for all skin and all flesh are also made from fibers and filaments woven together. This property, we observe, seems to apply to all such bodies, which can grow and nourish through the addition of other parts. Regarding other matters I have mentioned, which do not directly concern the senses, all of these are so simple and common that, when compared to the diverse composition and marvelous design we admire in the structure of those organs we can see, it will appear more plausible that I have omitted more than I have proposed, which are not part of us. And indeed, since it is well known that nature always uses the easiest and simplest means, it seems impossible that something more similar to what she uses can be found than the structures we have reviewed. -->
