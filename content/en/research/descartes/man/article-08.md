#### 8. When arteries swell, the blood particles within them are dispersed in all directions to the roots of certain filaments

These filaments form bones, flesh, skin, nerves, brain, and other solid parts according to the various ways they are connected and interwoven. 

These particles are able to nourish and slightly expand those parts by inserting themselves into their spaces. 

Once the arteries subsequently subside, each of the blood particles remains lodged in the spaces they occupy.

This is the sole reason why they are united with those they are contiguous to.

In a child's body, the pores of that soft material could dilate easily enough.
- In this way, the blood particles that contribute to the composition of solid parts would generally be slightly larger than the spaces they occupy.

In fact, 2-3 may even succeed one another in the space of one. This would be the cause of growth. 

Over the years, the material of those parts will gradually harden, preventing the pores from dilating any further. **This marks the end of growth and resulting in the body of an adult.**

However, only a few blood particles are occasionally united with the solid parts in the way described. 

Most of them return to the veins through various connections between arteries and veins. 

From the veins, some portion of the blood may divert toward the nourishment of some parts.

But a much larger portion returns to the heart. This then flows back to the arteries, leading to a perpetual circulation within the body.

Some blood particles enter:
- the spleen 
- the gallbladder.

From there, and also directly from the arteries, some particles flow back into the stomach and intestines, where they become a strong water to aid in food digestion. 

They are conveyed from the heart to these areas in an instant.
- This makes them very hot.
- This causes their vapors to rise easily through the esophagus to the mouth, where they form saliva. 

Some portions of the blood passing through the kidneys turns into urine.

Other parts convert into sweat and other excretions that emerge from the skin. 

In all these locations, it is solely the **arrangement, shape, or size of the pores** they pass through that determines whether they will pass or not. 

<!-- some are allowed to pass while others are prevented from flowing out, just -->

This is similar to how grains are sorted using sieves with differently sized holes.



### 9. The more vivid and actively-moving blood particles ascend to the brain's cavities

This is because the arteries that carry them are situated in a straighter line than other arteries branching from the heart.

All moving bodies strive to maintain their motion in a straight line as much as possible.

For example, consider the heart at point A. Imagine that when blood bursts forcefully from opening B, all its parts strive to reach point C, where the ventricles of the brain are located. 

However, since the passageway is too narrow for all to be conveyed, only the stronger particles make it through, while the weaker ones are impeded by the stronger ones.
