<!-- #### 140. The principle of the motion of a Planet


Let us assume that star `N` has less agitation, or less solidity, than the air-aether globules which are towards the circumference of our heavens, but still somewhat more than some of those which are towards the Sun.

As soon as it is snatched away by the Sun's vortex, it must immediately descend towards its center until it reaches those air-aether globules which are equal to it in solidity, or in aptitude for persevering in its motion along straight lines.

When it finally arrives there, it will no longer approach the Sun, nor move away from it, except as it is somewhat propelled here and there by some other causes.

It will be balanced among these celestial globules, it will continuously orbit around the Sun and become a planet. 

If it moved closer to the Sun, it would be among the air-aether globules that are slightly smaller.

Therefore, it would have more force to move away from the center around which it orbits; and more swiftly moved, and therefore by which this force along with agitation would be increased, and thus it would have to return from there again. 

But if it were to move further away from the Sun, it would encounter celestial globules that are somewhat less swiftly moved, and therefore which would decrease its agitation; and slightly smaller, and therefore which would have the force of repelling it towards the Sun.


#### 141. The causes of errors: First. 

But the other causes which somewhat propel the Planet here or there, librated around the Sun, are: 

1. The space in which it revolves together with the whole air-aether of the heavens is not perfectly spherical.

For it is necessary that where this space is wider, the matter of the heavens should flow more slowly, than where it is narrower.



#### 142. Second. Secondly, the fire-aether flows from certain neighbouring vortices towards the center of the first heaven.

From there, it reflows to certain others. It may be able to move in different ways both the air-aether globules and the Planet librated between them.


#### 143. Third. Thirdly, the passages which are in the body of this Planet may be more apt to receive the striated particles, and others of the fire-aether which come from certain parts of the heavens, than to receive the rest

whence it comes about, that the openings of these passages, which we said above are formed around the poles of the stars involving spots, are turned rather towards those parts of the heavens, than towards the others.


#### 144. Fourth.

Fourthly, there may have been some motions in that planet before, which persist in it for a very long time, even though other causes oppose them. 

For as we see a top, from the mere fact that it is once spun by a child, acquire enough force to persist in its motion for several minutes of an hour, meanwhile completing several thousand rotations, although it is small in size, and both the surrounding air and also the ground on which it rests oppose its motion: so it can easily be believed that from the mere fact that a planet was once moved when it was first formed, it could have continued its circuits from the origin of the world to the present time without any notable decrease in speed: 

because the time span of five or six thousand years, during which the world has stood, is much shorter compared to the size of a planet, than the time of one minute of an hour compared to the size of a small top.


#### 145. Fifth.

Finally, fifthly, that the force of thus persevering in its motion is much stronger and more constant in the planet than in the celestial matter surrounding it; and also stronger in a large planet than in a smaller one.

For this force in the celestial matter depends on the fact that its globules conspire together in the same motion: and since they are mutually separated, small changes can cause more or fewer of them to conspire together. 

Hence it follows that a planet never moves as quickly as the celestial globules surrounding it; for although it matches their motion with which it is carried along with them, they have many other motions as they are mutually separated.

Hence, it also follows that when the motion of these celestial globules is accelerated, slowed down, or bent, the motion of the planet moving among them is not accelerated, slowed down, or bent as much, nor as quickly.

#### 140. The principle of the motion of a Planet

Let us assume that the `Star N` has:
- less agitation, or has less solidity than the air-aether globules near the edge of our solar system.
- more agitation than the air-aether globules near the sun. 

<!-- , which are towards the circumference of our sky, but still has somewhat more than some of those which are towards the Sun:  -->

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/vortices.jpg" alt="Vortices" >}}

As soon as it enters the sun's vortex, it falls immediately towards the sun until it reache the air-aether globules that are equal to it in solidity. 

 <!-- is taken away from the vortex of the Sun, it should immediately descend towards its center, until it reaches those air-aether globules with which it is equal in solidity, or in aptitude to continue in its motion in straight lines. -->

<!--celestial globules , NB. See fig. pag. 171.  celestial -->

When it arrives there, it will no longer approach the Sun, nor will it recede from it, except insofar as it may be somewhat propelled here and there by some other causes.

Instead, it will be balanced among those air-aether globules and revolve continually around the Sun and will be a Planet. 

<!-- celestial -->
If it were to approach the Sun more closely, it would move among slightly smaller air-aether globules there.

Therefore those which it overcomes with force to move away from the center around which it revolves; and being moved faster.

Therefore the force would increase with its agitation causing it to regress from there again.

<!-- celestial -->
But if it were to recede more from the Sun, it would encounter slower air-aether globules. This would reduce its agitation.

Being slightly smaller, they have the force to repel it towards the Sun.


#### 141. Causes on which its errors depend

Other causes which somewhat propel the Planet around the Sun here and there are: 

<!-- matter of the sky -->
1. The space where it rotates with all the air-aether is not perfectly spherical.

<!-- matter of the sky -->
Where this space is wider, the air-aether must flow more slowly than where it is narrower.


#### 142. 2nd Cause

<!-- heaven -->
2. The fire-aether flows from some neighboring vortices towards the center of the current Vortex.
 <!-- first Territory. -->

From there, it flows back to the other vortices. It can move both the air-aether globules and also the Planet balanced among them in various ways.



#### 143. Third. 

3. The passages within the body of this Planet might be more suitable for receiving the striated particles and the other fire-aether particles coming from certain parts of outer space, than for receiving others.

 <!-- of the first element, which come from  sky -->

The openings of these passages form around the poles of the spots of the stars. These are turned towards those parts of outer space rather than towards others.


#### 144. Fourth

4. The planet might already have some motions which persist in it for a very long time even if other causes oppose them. 

A whirlwind might acquire sufficient force to continue its motion for a few minutes. Even if its mass is small, it might complete several thousand revolutions while it is opposed by:
- the surrounding air and
- the earth on which it stands

Similarly, a Planet's intial motion when it was first made from the beginning of its galaxy can continue up to this time without any notable decrease in speed.

<!-- This is because the galaxy might be 5-6,000 years old. Compared with the size of a Planet, this period is much shorter than the time of one minute's hour, when compared with the mass of a small whirlwind. -->


#### 145. Fifth

The force of persevering in its motion is much stronger and more constant in a Planet than in the air-aether surrounding it.
<!-- celestial matter -->
This force is even stronger in a large Planet than in a small one. 

This force in the air-aether is from all its globules conspiring to the same motion.

Since they are mutually separated, their conspiring can become less or more sometimes. 

 <!-- it can happen in small moments that now more, now fewer of them so conspire together.  -->

This is why a Planet never moves as fast as the air-aether globules surrounding it. It equals their motion that carries it with them. Yet, they have more motion since they are mutually separated. 
 <!-- others more, insofar as they -->

It follows that when the motion of these air-aether globules is accelerated, slowed, or deflected, the motion of the Planet revolving among them is not so much accelerated, slowed, or deflected.
<!-- , nor so quickly -->
