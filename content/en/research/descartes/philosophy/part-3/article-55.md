#### 55. What is light?

<!-- It is the law of Nature that  -->

All bodies that are moved in a circle tend to move away from the center as much as they can. 

<!-- I will explain the force by which  -->

Both the air-aether globules and the fire-aether gathered around `Center S` and `Center F` try to move away from those centers.

<!-- It will be shown below that  -->

Light consists solely in this force. 

<!-- Much else depends on the understanding of it. -->


#### 56. Understanding the effort towards motion in inanimate objects

The air-aether globules strive to move away from the centers that they rotate around. 

**This does not mean that they move by themselves.** 

Instead, they are moved in a certain way [by the collective motion of all globules] if if not hindered by any other cause.

<!-- it should not be thought that I am attributing any thought to them, from which this effort arises; 

rather, they are simply situated and moved in such a way that they will indeed move in that direction  -->


#### 57. How different efforts towards motion can coexist in the same body

Frequently, many different causes act simultaneously on the same body. Some impede the effects of others.

 <!-- depending on which we consider. -->

Therefore, the body tends, or tries to go, in different directions at the same time. 

For example, `Stone A` in the `Sling DA`, rotated around `Center D`, tends from `A` towards `B` if all causes determining its motion are considered together. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/world-13eee.jpg" alt="Sling" >}}

<!-- , because it indeed moves in that direction.  -->

But if we consider only the force of motion within it, we say that when it is at `A`, it tends towards `C`, according to the law of motion stated above by considering the line `AC` to be straight and tangent to the circle at point `A`. 

If the stone were to leave the sling when it reaches `A` coming from `L`, it would proceed from `A` towards `C`, not towards `B`.

**The sling prevents this, but it does not prevent the effort** [which is from the hand or vortex].  

Finally, if we cancel the circular motion and only consider the force that is resisted by the sling, then the stone, while at `A`, tends only towards `E` by moving away from the `Center D` along the straight line `DAE`.


#### 58. How bodies moving in a circle try to move away from the center of their motion.

Let us compare the motion of:
- a stone at point `A` going towards `C`, if it were not impeded by any other force
- an ant at the same point `A` also moving towards C if the line `EY` were a stick.

**Superphyics Note:**
The fire-aether moves instantly and explosively like the rock on the sling. This leads to **one** explosive motion:
- This explosive motion is the release of the rock from the sling on straight lines from the edge of the vortex which is the surface of a star. 

<!-- The air-aether moves slowly like the ant on the rod. This leads to 2 motions:

1. This slow motion as the walking of the ant is the pre-force of gravity 
from the sling on straight lines from the edge of the vortex which is the surface of a star.  -->
{{< /box >}}

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/fig_15.jpg" alt="Ant" cap="This is the motion of the air-aether" >}}

The ant would walk straight from `A` towards `Y` while the stick turned around the center `E`.
- Point `A` of the stick would draw circle `ABF`
- The 2 motions would be simultaneous.

In this way, the ant would:
- arrive at `X` when the stick were at `C`
- arrive at `Y` when the stick were at `G`.

Thus, the ant would always be in the straight line `ACG`.

The stone tied to the sling would be like the ant that is glued to the rod. If it were released instantly, 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/fig_16.jpg" alt="Sling" >}}



<!-- , driven in a sling according to the circular line ABF, strives to move away from the center `E`, according to the straight lines `AD, BC, FG`, with the effort which would remain in the ant, if it were detained at the point `A`, on the stick `EY`, by glue, while in the meantime this stick carried it around the center `E`, through the circular line `ABF`, and it itself would strive with all its might to go towards Y, and thus to move away from the center `E`, according to the straight lines `EAY`, `EBY`, and so on. 


Assume that an ant was on `A` in line `DAE` which is a rod that the ant can walk from `A` to `E`. This rod then rotated into `DBY` and `DFY`, making the circle `ABF`.

Compare the ant's motion with the motion that carries the stone at point `A`  towards `C` if not impeded by the sling.  -->

<!-- with the motion by which an ant at the same point `A` would also move towards C, if the line EY were a rod on which it would walk straight from A to Y while the rod itself rotated around the center E, and the point A on the rod described the circle ABF.  -->

<!-- These two motions would be so coordinated that the ant would reach `X` when the rod is at `C`, and reach `Y` when the rod is at `G`. 

Thus, the ant would always be on the straight line `ACG`. 

Also, compare the force by which the same stone, acted upon in the sling along the `Curve ABF`, tries to move away from `Center D` along the straight lines `AE, BY, FG`, with the effort remaining in the ant if it were held at `A` by a glue on the rod `DAE` while the rod carried it around the center `D` along the curve `ABF`, and it tried with all its might to go towards `Y`. 

Thus it moves away from the `Center E` along the straight lines `EAY`, `EBY`, and similar. -->


#### 59. The magnitude of this effort

The ant's motion will be very slow initially. Therefore its effort, if considered only at the start of the motion, might not seem significant.

However, it is not entirely absent.

As it takes effect, it increases so that the resulting motion can become quite fast. 

Let `EY` be a tube containing a ball `A`. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/fig_18.jpg" alt="Tube" >}}

When the tube starts to rotate around Center `E`, the ball will immediately progress very slowly towards `Y`. 

But in the next moment, it will move a little faster, retaining its previous force and acquiring a new one from its new effort to move away from the Center `E`. 

As long as the circular motion continues, this effort persists and is renewed each moment. 

If the channel EY is rotated very quickly around the Center `E`, the ball will soon move from `A` to `Y`. 

We also observe this in a sling. 

The faster the stone rotates within it, the more the cord tightens. 

This tension arises solely from the stone's force in trying to move away from the center of its motion.

<!-- , shows us the magnitude of this force.  -->
