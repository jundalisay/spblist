### The 2nd Element


 <!-- of celestial matter -->
#### 48. How all the air-aether particles became spherical.

<!-- So, to begin to show the efficacy of the laws of nature in the proposed hypothesis, it must be considered that the particles into which we suppose  -->

All the matter of this world was initially divided into non-spherical particles. This is because globules joined together cannot fill a continuous space. 

But whatever their shape was then, they became round over time since they had various circular motions. 

They were moved at the beginning with sufficient force to separate from each other. But that same persisting force also wore down all their angles as they subsequently collided. 

For this, not as much force was required as for the initial separation. 

<!-- This force wore away And from this alone, that the angles of a body are thus worn away, we easily understand that  -->

They eventually became round. 

Here, the name "angle" is given to everything in a body that protrudes beyond the spherical shape.


#### 49. There is a finer matter around these spherical particles

**There can be no void in space.**  Yet those round matter particles, when joined together, leave some very small gaps around them.


<!-- However, since spaces devoid of any body cannot exist anywhere, and since  -->

These gaps must be filled with some other matter:
- as very tiny fragments
- having shapes to fill them
- constantly changing according to the ratio of the space occupied. 

While those matter particles are becoming round, their angles are gradually worn away. What is abraded from them is so small and acquires such speed that it is divided into innumerable fragments by its own motion. 

Thus, it fills all the angles which other particles of matter cannot penetrate.


#### 50. The particles of this finer matter can be easily divided.

The smaller these particles are, the more easily they can be moved and broken down into even smaller pieces. 

The smaller they are, the more surface area they have in proportion to their volume.

They encounter other bodies by their surface and are divided by their volume.


#### 51. The same particles move very quickly.

They are agitated much more swiftly than the other particles of matter from which they acquire their agitation. 

This is because while these other particles move through straight and open paths, they expel the finer particles through oblique and narrow paths.

In the same way, we see air exit very quickly from a bellows, even if it is slowly closed, because of the narrowness of the passage through which it passes. 

Some portion of matter must move very quickly and be divided into practically infinite particles. 

This is so that various circular and unequal motions can occur without decompression or voids. 

<!-- No other matter is found to be suitable for this purpose. -->

<!-- rarefaction = decompression -->
