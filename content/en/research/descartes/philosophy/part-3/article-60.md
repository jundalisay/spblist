#### 60. This effort found in the air-aether
 <!-- celestial matter -->

The air-aether globules move like:

1. The stone in a sling [This is the explosive movement]
2. The ball rotating in a tube around the center `E` [This is the displacement movement]

Each one tries to move away from the center of the vortex that it revolves around. 

 <!-- with considerable force:  -->

They are held in place by other surrounding globules, just as the stone is held by the sling.
- The outer globules are pressed by the inner ones.

<!-- Additionally, this force in them is greatly increased by the fact that  -->

<!-- upper  lower -->


All of them together are pressed by fire-aether from the center of each vortex. 

To distinguish everything accurately, we will speak here only of these air-aether globules.

We will only speak of the fire-aether when there are spaces that are devoid of the air-aether*. 

{{< n n="Examples are black holes which are more of pure aether" >}}

 <!-- than if all the spaces occupied by it were empty, that is, as if they were filled with matter that neither aids nor hinders the motion of other bodies. -->

**Truly empty space cannot exist.**

<!-- those in the straight line SA press mutually towards A, and those in the straight line SE press towards E, and so on for the others. Therefore, if there are not enough to occupy the entire space between S and the circumference AEI, all that space which they do not occupy will be left towards S. And because those that press against each other (for example, those in the straight line SE) do not all revolve like a stick simultaneously, but some complete their circuit faster, others slower, as will be explained more fully below, the space they leave towards S cannot help but be round. 

For even if we imagined that initially there were more globules in the straight line SE than in SA or SI, so that the lower parts of the line SE were closer to the center S than the lower parts of the line SI, since however those lower parts completed their circuit faster than the upper parts, some of them would have immediately joined the end of the line SI, so as to move away from S all the more; therefore, now all the lower parts of these lines are equally distant from the point S, and thus the space BCD, which they leave around it, is round. -->



#### 61. Demonstration on how the Sun and the Fixed Stars are round

All the air-aether globules that revolve around `S` in `Vortex AEI` try to move away from `S`.
- Those in the straight line `SA` all press towards `A`
- Those in the straight line `SE` all press towards `E` and so on with the rest.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/fig_19.jpg" alt="Vortex" >}}

If they are too few to occupy the area between `S` and the circumference `AEI`, all that is not occupied is left towards `S`. 

These globules that press on each other in a straight line do not all turn together like a rod.
- Instead, some are quicker than the others in completing their circuit.

The space which they leave near `S` becomes round. 

<!-- For even if we were to imagine that there were more globules at first in the straight line SE, than in SA or SI, so that the lowest of the line SE were nearer the center S than the lowest of the line SI; 

yet, since those lowest ones would have completed their circuit more quickly than the upper ones, some of them would have immediately joined the end of line SI, moving away from S faster.

In this way, all the lowest of these lines are equally far from `S`. -->

This makes the space `BCD`, which they leave around it, round.


 <!-- celestial matter all points of-->
#### 62. The same effect causes the air-aether to try to move away from the circumference of any star


All the globules in the straight line `SE` press one another towards `E` 
- But they are also pressed by those coming from behind them in other angles. 

<!-- ; but also each one of them is pressed by all the others, which are contained between the straight lines drawn from it to the circumference BCD, and touching it.  -->

For example, the globule `F` is pressed by those which are within:
- the lines `BF` and `DF`
- the triangular space `BFD`

But they are not pressed by the other surrounding air-aether. 

If the place `F` were empty, only the globules contained in the space `BFD` would fill it up. 

<!-- For just as we see the same force of gravity, which directly leads a stone falling in the free air to the center of the earth, also carries it obliquely thither, when its straight motion is hindered by the declivity of some plane; so there is no doubt that the same force, by which all the globules contained in the space BFD strive to recede from the center S, according to the straight lines drawn from that center, is sufficient to remove them from there also, by lines deviating from that center. -->

<!-- The air-aether globules in the straight line `SE` press each other towards `E`. 

Each one is also pressed by all the others contained between the straight lines drawn from it to the circumference `BCD`, which they touch.

For example, the globule F is pressed by all the others within the lines BF and DF, or the triangular space BFD; not in the same way by the others. 

If the place F were empty, all the globules in the space BFD would simultaneously move to fill it as much as possible, but none of the others would. 

Just as we see the same force of gravity that directly leads a falling stone in free air to the center of the Earth also carrying it there obliquely when its direct motion is hindered by the slope of a plane, there is no doubt that the same force by which all the globules in the space `BFD` try to move away from the center S along the straight lines drawn from that center is sufficient to also move them away from it along lines declining from that center.

#### 63. The air-aether globules do not impede each other in this effort.

<!-- This example of gravity will clearly explain the matter if we consider   -->

Let vessel `BFD` contain lead balls. 

These press against each other in such a way that if a hole is made at the bottom of the vessel at `F`, ball `1` descends by its own weight.


{{< img src="/graphics/physics/fig_20.jpg" alt="Vortex" >}}


Balls `2` and `2` will follow it, followed by balls `3, 3, 3`, and so on. 

Thus when ball `1` leaves, all the others in the triangular space `BFD` will fall together, leaving the rest immobile. This is becase they will be impeded by globes `2, 2`.

 <!-- have followed the descending globe 1 for a while, they impede each other from continuing further.  -->

However, the same does not apply to the air-aether globules. **This is because they are in perpetual motion.**

<!-- Even if it happens that they are arranged in the same way as the lead globes depicted here,  -->

**This pause can only last for a minimal moment of time, called an instant.** 
- This does not interrupt the continuity of their motion.*

{{< n n="This is the spacetime slices" >}}

<!-- **The force of light does not consist in any duration of motion, but solely in pressure or in the initial preparation for motion, even if the motion itself might not follow from it.** -->

**The force of light does not consist in continuous motion. It is solely from the initial pressure that causes the motion.**


#### 64. All the properties of light found is in this effort. 

This is why light can be seen as emanating from stars, even if there is no force in the stars themselves.

The action called light spreads equally in all directions from the body of the Sun or any fixed star. 

It extends to any distance in the smallest moment of time, along straight lines drawn:
- from the center of the luminous body
- from any other points on its surface. 

Hence, all other properties of light can be deduced.

<!-- And what may perhaps appear paradoxical to many,  -->

All these things are from the air-aether and not from the star. 

 <!-- would be so in the celestial matter, even if there were no force at all in the Sun, or other star around which it revolves. -->

If the sun's body became merely an empty space, its light would be weaker. Yet we would still see it as a circle that moves in the heavens. 

This is because we have not yet considered all the dimensions of the solar system*.

{{< n n="The light would be from the circumference of the sun which would come from neighboring fire-aether" >}} 

 <!-- the spheres.  -->

<!-- But in order that we may also be able to explain what it is in the Sun itself and the Stars, by which that force of light is increased, and diffused according to all the dimensions of the sphere, some things concerning the motion of the heavens must be premised.


And what might seem paradoxical to many, all these would be the same in celestial matter even if there were no force at all in the Sun or any other star around which it revolves: 

so much so that if the body of the Sun were nothing but empty space, we would still see its light, not as strong, but otherwise no different than now, at least in the circle in which the celestial matter moves; for here we are not yet considering all the dimensions of the sphere. -->

<!-- To explain what is in the Sun and stars that increases this force of light and spreads it through all dimensions of the sphere, some details about the motion of the heavens need to be presented first. -->
