<!-- ## [4.001] Maintaining the false hypothesis we have used before to explain the true natures of things.

Although I am unwilling to believe that the bodies of this visible world were ever generated in the manner described above, as I have sufficiently forewarned, I must still retain the same hypothesis to explain those things that appear above the Earth. Ultimately, if, as I hope to clearly demonstrate, the causes of all natural things can be given in this way, and not in any other, it may rightfully be concluded that their nature is none other than if they were generated in such a manner. -->

#### 2. How the Earth was Created 

<!-- According to this Hypothesis. -->

Our Earth was once formed solely from the fire-aether, like the Sun, although much smaller.

It was the center of a vast vortex around it.

<!-- , in whose center it stood. -->

The fire-aether had virual photons and other very minute particles. These adhered to each other [via fusion] and thus were converted into the earth-aether.

 <!-- we continually see being generated and dissolved  -->
Sun spots were then generated on the Earth's surface, similar to those around the Sun. 

The continuous dissolution of these spots caused earth-aether particles to scatter throughout the neighboring sky. 
- This gradually formed a great mass of air or aether there.

After this ether became very large, it wove denser spots around the Earth. This covered and darkened it completely. 


Many spots were pressing against each other but could no longer be dissolved.

At the same time, the force of the Earth's vortex was diminishing.

And so the vortex finally collapsed, along with:
- the spots
- the entire ether that enveloped it

It joined a larger vortex, the center of which is the Sun.



#### 3. The 3 Regions of the Earth: Region 1

The Earth has 3 regions inside it, as a planet not yet fallen towards the Sun, but about to fall.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/earth.png" alt="Earth's regions" >}}

The first and innermost of these contains only the fire-aether, with less purity. It moves the same as in the Sun. 

The fire-aether that continually goes from the Sun into the spots cannot be so easily purified from it. 

<!-- Almost the entire space of Region 1 is filled only with the earth-aether.  -->

<!-- , unless it seemed to follow from this that the body of the Earth could not remain as close to the Sun as it is now, due to its excessive solidity. -->


#### 4. Region 2

The middle region `M` is entirely occupied by a very opaque and dense body. This is made up of extremely small particles that belonged to the fire-aether but fused together. 

The only passages left in it were so small that they can allow the passage of:
- the virtual photons 
- the remaining fire-aether.

This is confirmed by experience in the spots of the Sun which are of the same nature as this body `M` except that they are much thinner and rarer. 

Nevertheless, they hinder the passage of light. This is because their passages are narrow and do not  admit the globules of the air-aether.

These passages were initially formed in fluid or soft matter. They would also be straight and smooth to not hinder the action of light.


#### 5. Region 3

<!-- But these two inner regions of the Earth little concern us because no one has ever approached them alive. -->

<!-- Only the third remains, from which we will show that -->

All the bodies found around us are in this region. 

<!-- can arise in the future.  -->

But for now, we suppose nothing else in it than a large heap of particles of the earth-aether, having much air-aether around them, whose inner nature can be recognized from the way they were generated.
