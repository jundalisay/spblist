#### 152. Why one magnet is attrcted by another.

 <!-- turns and inclines towards another, in the same way as towards the Earth. -->
 
<!-- When these virtual photons flow through individual magnets in exactly the same way as through the Earth, two spherical magnets must turn towards one another in no other way than towards the entire Earth.  -->


Virtual photons are always gathered in much greater quantity around each magnet than in the remote air.
- This is because the magnet has passages that they can flow through much more easily than through the surrounding air.

This retains them near the magnet.

Their quantity is greater in the whole air and other bodies surrounding the Earth than in nearby outer space because of the passages they have in the Earth's interior. 
 <!-- the sky.  -->

<!-- As far as the magnetic force is concerned, exactly the same things must be thought of one magnet in relation to another magnet, as of  -->

The Earth itself can be called the greatest magnet.



#### 153. The North and South Poles of 2 Magnets will attract each other. 

<!-- Nor do two magnets turn towards each other only until the north pole of one faces the south pole of the other, but moreover, after they have thus turned, they approach each other until they touch each other, if nothing impedes their motion. -->

The virtual photons move extremely fast as long as they are in the passages of the magnets. This is because there they are borne by the impulse of the fire-aether to which they belong.

When they go out from the magnet, they meet the particles of other bodies that drive them away, since these belong to the air-aether of earth-aether and do not have so much speed.

Thus, those which pass through the magnet `1` are of 2 kinds:
- Those going from `S` to `N`. Inside the magnet, they acquire the force to proceed further in straight lines towards `R`
- Those going from `N` to `S`. These acquire the force to proceed further in straight lines towards `C`

In `R` and `C` they meet so many air-aether or earth-aether particles.*
- These reflect them back towards `V`. 

{{< n n="We peg the cause of the reflection to the low pressure at the other pole or entrance which then sucks them back to that pole" >}}

The whole space `RVC` through which they are thus dispersed is called the sphere of power or activity of this magnet `1`.

This sphere of power is greater the larger the magnet, especially the longer it is in the line `NS`.
- This is because the virtual photons, progressing farther through it, acquire more agitation.

Thus also those which pass through the magnet `2` go straight on both sides towards `C` and `T`.
- From there, they are reflected towards `X`, and drive the whole air-aether contained in the sphere of their activity. 

They expel the air-aether if there is a place where they can move away.
- This separates the spheres of power [magnetic fields] of these magnets

<!--  are separated from each other

But when they coalesce into one, then it is easier for the virtual photons:
- coming from magnet `1` towards `C` to proceed straight on to magnet `2` than to be reflected towards `V`
 <!-- and `R` -->
- coming from magnet `2` towards `C` to proceed straight on to magnet `1` than to be reflected towards `X`

<!-- , in the place of those which were returning from `T` through `X` to `C` and `s`, 
,
 whither those coming from `X` do not find it difficult to proceed. -->

<!-- It is easier for those coming from Magnet `2` to `C` to proceed on to Magnet `1`, than to be reflected towards `X`, whither also those coming from `V` do not find it difficult to proceed.  -->

Thus these virtual photons pass through these 2 magnets `1` and `2` as if they were one. 

Then it is easier for the virtual photons, proceeding straight from `1` to `2`, and from `2` to `1`, to expel the intermediate air-aether from `C` and thus cause these magnets to attract until they touch at `C`.

 <!-- towards `R` and `T`, in the place of the magnets `1` and `2`, and thus to  -->

 <!-- , than to strive through all that air from `A` to `b`, and from `V` to `X`; which two ways become shorter when these two magnets approach each other, or, if one is retained, when at least the other comes to it. -->


#### 154. Why do magnets repel each other when brought together? 

The poles of two magnets, such as South and South or North and North, repel each other if brought too close.

The virtual photons coming from the pole of one magnet that faces the other cannot enter the other magnet.
- They require some space between the two magnets to pass through in order to return to the pole of the magnet where they came from. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/magnetrepel.jpg" >}}

Those coming out of Magnet `1` through the pole `S` cannot enter into Magnet `2` through its pole `s`. 
- They need some space between `S` and `s` to pass towards `V` and `X`.
- This force moves them from `N` to `S`, repelling Magnet `2`.

And so, coming out of Magnet `2` they repel the Magnet `1` at least when their axes `NS` and `ns` are in the same straight line. 

But when they are bent ever so little more to one side than to the other, then these magnets turn themselves, in the manner explained before.

If this turning is prevented, but not their straight motion, then again one magnet drives the other away in a straight line. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/magnetboat.jpg" >}}

Assume that:
- Magnet `2` is placed on a small boat with its axis upright perpendicular to the surface
- Magnet `1` is placed near, with its North pole facing the North pole of Magnet `2`

If Magnet `1` is moved towards `Y`, Magnet 2 will move away towards `Z` before it touches Magnet `1`.

This is because no matter how the boat turns, there always needs to be some space between these two magnets for the striped particles exiting through poles N and n to pass through towards V and X.

<!-- They require some space between A and a through which they can pass towards V and B, and by the force with which they are moved from B to A, they drive away the magnet P; and thus the particles coming out from P drive away the magnet O: at least when their axes BA and ab are in the same straight line. But when they are a little more bent to one side than the other, then these magnets turn, in the manner explained a little before; or if this turning of theirs is prevented, but not their straight motion, then one magnet again drives away the other in a straight line. 

Thus, if the magnet O is placed on a small boat floating on water, so that its axis always remains perpendicular, and the magnet P, whose southern pole is opposite the southern pole of the other, is moved by hand towards Y, it will result that the magnet O will recede towards Z before it is touched by the magnet P. 

Whichever way the boat turns, there is always a certain space required between these two magnets, so that the virtual photons coming out from their poles `AT` can pass towards `V` and `X`. -->
