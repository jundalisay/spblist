<!-- XXVIII. On the third action, which is light; how it moves air particles. The force of light, as it spreads from the Sun and stars to all parts of the sky, has already been sufficiently explained above: it only remains for us to note here that its rays, having descended from the Sun, affect the particles of Earth in various ways. Although, in itself, it is nothing more than a certain pressure, which occurs along straight lines extending from the Sun to the Earth: because this pressure, however, is not equally applied to all the particles of the third element, which make up the uppermost region of the Earth, but now to one, now to another, and even now to one end of the same particle, now to another: it can easily be understood how various motions are excited in these particles themselves. For example, if AB is one of the particles of the third element, composing the uppermost region of the Earth, which presses on another particle C, with many others interposed between it and the Sun, such as DEF; these interposed ones will now prevent the rays of the Sun GG from pressing on the end B, but not on A; thus end A will be depressed, and end B will be raised. And because these particles constantly change position, shortly after they will be opposed to the rays of the Sun tending towards A, but not those tending towards B; thus end A will be raised again, and B will be depressed. The same applies to all the particles of the Earth reached by the Sun's rays, and therefore they are all affected by the Sun's light.

XXIX. On the fourth, which is heat: what it is, and how it persists after light is removed. This agitation of terrestrial particles, whether arising from light or from any other cause, is called heat; especially when it is greater than usual and is perceptible; for the designation of heat is related to the sense of touch. It should be noted that each of the terrestrial particles agitated in this way continues afterwards in its motion according to the laws of nature, until it is stopped by some other cause; and therefore heat originating from light always remains for some time after the light is removed.

XXX. Why it penetrates deeper than light. Furthermore, it should be noted that the terrestrial particles, impelled by the Sun's rays in this way, affect others nearby to which these rays do not reach; and these, in turn, affect others, and so on. Since always half of the Earth is illuminated by the Sun, all such particles are simultaneously moved, so that although light remains on the outer opaque surface, heat generated from it must penetrate to the innermost parts of the middle region of the Earth. -->


### 28. The Third Action: Light -- How Does Light Move Air Particles?

The force of the light from the Sun and stars spread to all parts of the sky.

The sun's rays interact with the earth-aether particles in various ways.

These rays exert a straight-line pressure from the Sun to the Earth.

This pressure is not applied uniformly to all particles of the earth-aether in the upper region of the Earth.

<!-- , but now to one, now to another, and even at times to one extremity of the same particle and then to another, it can be easily understood how  -->

This creates various motions in these particles. 

For example, if `AB` is an earth-aether particle in the upper region of the Earth, leaning towards another particle `C`, with many other particles like `D, E, F` interspersed between them.

These intervening particles may hinder the Sun's rays `G`, `G` from pressing on the extremity `B` but not on `A`. 

Thus, the extremity `A` will be depressed, and `B` will be raised.

These particles constantly change their positions. Shortly afterwards, they will be opposed to the Sun's rays tending toward `A`, but not to those tending toward `B`.

Consequently, the extremity `A` will rise again, and `B` will be depressed. 

The same happens with all Earth particles reached by the Sun's light, and hence, all are moved by the light.



### 29. The Fourth Action: Heat - how it persists after light is removed

This agitation of earth-aether particles*, whether originating from light or any other cause, is called heat, especially when it is greater than usual and affects the senses.

{{< n n="We base the cause of heat in the 1st Element, but carried through heat particles, not by photons. Unlike photons which are 2-dimensional, and unlike virtual photons that are rigid, these heat particles are 3-dimensional and flexible like spacetime particles" >}}


The designation of heat is related to the sense of touch. 

Each of these earth-aether particles, once set in motion, persists in its motion according to the laws of nature until it is stopped by some other cause.

This is why the heat originating from light continues to exist for some time after the light is removed.*

{{< n n="We hypothesize that the heat particles bounce between the 3rd Element particles to keep them warm. Eventually, they dissipate into the external 2nd Element and so the body cools down. Physics calls this dissipation as entropy" >}}


### 30. Why heat penetrates deeper than light

The earth-aether particles, impelled by the Sun's rays, agitate others nearby to which these rays do not reach.  These, in turn, agitate others, and so on.

The entire half of the Earth is always illuminated by the Sun.

So many of these earth-aether particles are set in motion that their heat penetrates to the innermost parts of the middle region of the Earth.*

{{< n n="We hypothesize that the heat particles are 3-dimensional columnar and so they can penetrate deeper into the Earth. However, they are not rigid like virtual photons. And so virtual photons can pass through the entire earth and galaxy to create planetary and galactic magnetic fields. Whereas heat cannot spread as far." >}}

### 31. Why heat decompresses almost all bodies

When agitated by more than usual heat, these earth-aether particles cannot be contained in the usual narrow space as when they are at rest or less in motion.

This is because they have irregular shapes.
- They occupy less space when connected in a certain way and at rest than when they are continually moving and separating. 

Thus, heat decompresses almost all terrestrial bodies to varying degrees depending on the arrangement and shape of the particles they are made of.*


{{< n n="We hypothesize that the heat particles decompress bodies because they are flexible like the spactime particles. And so they switch from columnar to flat and take the shape of spacetime which then makes the real spacetime easy to replace them when they get dissipated." >}}
