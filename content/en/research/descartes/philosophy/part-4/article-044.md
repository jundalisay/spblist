#### 44. The origin of mountains, plains, seas, etc., on the Earth's surface.

- Body `B` and `F` are air.
- Body `C` is the very thick inner crust of the Earth from which metals originate
- Body `D` is water
- Body `E` is the outer Earth composed of rocks, clay, sand, and mud.
- Above the fragments `2 3` and `6 7`, raised by water, are seas.
- Above the other fragments inclined more gently and not covered by water, such as `8 9` and `V`, are flat plains.
- Above the more erect ones, like `1 2` and `9 4 V`, are mountains.
  - They split into many smaller fragments when they fall due to their own gravity and their ends strongly collide with each other.

These fragments formed:
- rocks on some seashores, such as `1`
- the multiple ridges of mountains, some very high like `4`, others gentler like `9` and `V`
- sea cliffs, such as `3` and `6`


#### 45. The nature of the air can be derived from all this.

It means that physical air is just a collection of earth-aether particles. 

They are so fine and separated from each other that they comply with any motion of the air-aether globules. 

Therefore, it is a very decompressed, fluid, and transparent substance that can be composed of the minutiae of any shape.

#### 46. Why does physical air easily compress and decompress?

<!-- rarefy and densify? -->

Air easily compresses with cold and decompresses with heat.

As almost all its particles are flexible, like soft feathers or thin threads.

The faster they move, the more they expand, requiring a larger spherical space for their motion.

<!-- It is known from what has been said that  refers to nothing other than-->

In this context:
- **heat is merely the acceleration of motion in these particles**
- **cold is its decrease**.


#### 47. The violent compression of air in certain machines.

Air, violently compressed in a vessel, possesses the force to rebound and immediately extend itself over a larger space. 

Hence, machines are created that, using only the force of air that can:
- lift water upwards like fountains. and
- project projectiles with great force, similar to bows.

This is because air particles need space around them for the air-aether globules to flow around them. 
- When they are compressed, other air particles occuply this space. 

The agitation and heat of the compressed air particles is preserved by the motion of the air-aether globules constantly flowing around them.
- This causes the physical air particles to mutually strike each other at their extremities and displace each other.
- This makes them collectively, exert force to occupy a larger space.



<!--  in this way, each of its spherical particles does not have the space required for its motion alone.
- Instead, neighboring particles enter this space.

Meanwhile, the same heat or the same motion of these particles .
- This cause the physical air particles to strike each other with their extremities and displace each other. 

The reason for this is that when the air is compressed in such a way, each of its particles does not have that spherical space necessary for its movement to itself alone, but neighboring particles enter into it; 

and while the same heat or agitation of these particles is maintained by the motion of celestial globes constantly flowing around them, they 


, thus collectively making an effort to occupy a larger space. -->
