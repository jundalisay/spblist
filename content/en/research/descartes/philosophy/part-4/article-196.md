#### 196. The soul perceives only in so far as it is in the brain

The soul does not perceive in so far as it is in each member of the body.

It can only perceive when it is in the brain. This is where the nerves, by their movements, convey to the brain the actions of the external objects that touch the parts of the body in which they are inserted.

There are 3 proofs for this:

1. There are various maladies which affect the brain alone. Yet these bring disorder on our senses. 

<!-- , or deprive us of the use of, -->
This is the same way that sleep only affects the brain. Yet it takes from us the faculty of perception which afterwards is restored to us in our waking state.


2. The obstruction to the movement of the nerves that extend from the brain to the end of those nerves can take away sensation from the part of the body.

This happens even if there is no disease in the brain [or in the parts where the organs of the external senses are]. 


 <!-- these members be obstructed in any part of the distance that is between the two. -->

3. We sometimes feel pain in certain body parts even if the real cause is somewhere nearer the brain.

<!-- , the cause of which, however, is not in these members where it is felt, but  -->

<!-- , through which the nerves pass that give to the mind the sensation of it. I could establish this fact by innumerable experiments; I will here, however, merely refer to one of them. -->

A girl suffered from a bad ulcer in the hand. She had her eyes bandaged whenever the surgeon came to dress it as she was unable to bear the sight of the dressing of the sore. 

The gangrene spread. After a few days, the arm was amputated from the elbow without the girl's knowledge. 

Linen cloths tied one above the other were substituted in place of the part amputated, so that she remained for some time without knowing that the operation had been performed.

Meanwhile, she complained of feeling various pains, sometimes in one finger of the hand that was cut off, and sometimes in another.

The only explanation is that the nerves which before stretched from the brain to the hand, but now ended in near the elbow, were moved in the same way as they did before the amputation. 

This movement still impressed on the mind in the brain the sensation of pain in the finger.

 <!-- required to be moved before in the hand for the purpose of  -->

This clearly shows that the pain of the hand is not felt by the mind in so far as it is in the hand, but in so far as it is in the brain.



#### 197. The mind can be excited by the various sensations from the motion of body.

<!-- In the next place, it can be proved that our mind is of such a nature that  -->

The motions of the body alone are sufficient to excite all sorts of thoughts in the mind, even if those motions do not resemble those thoughts. 

 <!-- without it being necessary that these should in any way resemble the motions which give rise to them, and especially that these motions can excite in it those  -->

Confused thoughts are called sensations (SENSUS, SENSATIONES). These especially can give rise to such thoughts. 

Words, whether uttered or written, excite in our minds all kinds of thoughts and emotions. 

<!-- On the same paper, with the same pen and ink, by merely moving the point of the pen over the paper in a particular way, we can trace letters that will raise in the minds of our readers the thoughts of combats, tempests, or the furies, and the passions of indignation and sorrow; 

in place of which, if the pen be moved in another way hardly different from the former, this slight change will cause thoughts widely different from the above, such as those of repose, peace, pleasantness, and the quite opposite passions of love and joy.  -->

Someone will object that:
- writing and speech do not immediately excite any passions in the mind
- the imaginations of things are different from the letters and sounds

 <!-- but afford simply the knowledge of these, on occasion of which the mind, understanding the signification of the words, afterwards excites in itself the imaginations and passions that correspond to the words.  -->

But what about the sensations of pain and titillation? 

The motion of a sword that almost cuts our skin gives us a real fearful sensation even if the sword would not really cut our skin. 


<!-- cutting a part of our skin causes pain, [but does not on that account make us aware of the motion or figure of the sword]. 

This sensation of pain is not less different from the motion that causes it, or from that of the part of our body which the sword cuts, than are the sensations we have of colour, sound, odour, or taste. -->

On this, we may conclude that our mind is easily excited to enter sensations that are not real.

 <!-- of such a nature that the motions alone of certain bodies can also  in it all the other sensations -->

<!-- , as the motion of a sword excites in it the sensation of pain. -->
