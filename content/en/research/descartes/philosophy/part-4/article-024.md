#### 24. How much gravity does a Body Have?

There is also some air-aether in the channels of rock `B`. 

This air-aether opposes the air-aether in the physical air, which then renders the air-aether in the channels idle.

<!-- To ensure a proper calculation, it must be considered that  -->

<!-- an equal quantity of similar -->


Likewise, there are some earth-aether particles in the physical air that opposes the earth-aether particles of rock `B`. But these do nothing to the earth-aether particles of that body. 

Subtracting these from both sides, the remaining air-aether in this physical air acts on the remaining earth-aether particles of `Body B`. 

**In this alone, its gravity consists.** *

In Newtonian Physics, gravity is dependent on object's mass which is then measured by acceleration on Earth.

But in Cartesian Physics, the gravity (and movement in general) is dependent on the ratio of spacetime particles to each other. A massive object has far less spacetime. This means spacetime is pushing around it from all sides, causing it to be harder to move. 

In contrast, a less massive object has so much spacetime that it is easy to move in space. This is why the next article emphasizes that gravity is not based on the amount of matter in a body. It is just common to have less spacetime in a matter-dense body.

#### 25. The quantity of gravity does not correspond to the quantity of matter in each body*

{{< n n="This specifically refutes Newton who based gravity on the amount of matter in each body" >}}
<!-- Its quantity does not correspond to the quantity of matter in each body. And so that nothing is omitted, it must also be noted that by celestial matter we do not mean here only the globules of the second element, but also the matter of the first element mixed with them, and that those terrestrial particles which follow its course and move more quickly than the others are also to be referred to it; such as are all those that compose the air. Furthermore, it must be noted that the matter of the first element, other things being equal, has a greater force to drive terrestrial bodies downward than the globules of the second element, because it has more agitation; and 


hese globules have a greater force than the terrestrial particles of air which they move with them, for a similar reason. Hence, it is not easy to estimate from weight alone how much terrestrial matter is contained in each body. And it may be that, although, for example, 

a mass of gold weighs twenty times more than an equal volume of water, it does not contain four or five times more terrestrial matter: both because the same amount must be subtracted from each, due to the air in which they are weighed; and also because in the water itself, as in all other liquid bodies, there is a lightness with respect to solid bodies, due to the motion of their particles. -->


The air-aether that causes gravity is made up of:
- the air-aether
- the air-aether that is mixed with the fire-aether*
- the air-aether in the earth-aether in the physical air**

{{< n n="<ul><li>*This is seen in the Galileo 5 and 6 satellites which are disturbed from their orbits by the light from the sun</li><li>**Only this part is removed when a body falls in a vacuum</li></ul>" >}}

 <!-- terrestrial particles which follow its course and move more quickly than the others -->

<!-- Furthermore, it includes those terrestrial particles that, following its course, move faster than others, such as all those composing the air.  -->

**The fire-aether, all else being equal, has a greater force to push downward on terrestrial bodies than the air-aether globules because it has more agitation.** *

{{< n n="This is explains why gravity is weaker than magnetism. This is important in creating artificial gravity" >}}


The air-aether globules, in turn, have more force than the physical air that they carry with them, for a similar reason. 

Hence, gravity alone cannot easily estimate how much earth-aether is in each body.

<!-- It is also possible that, for example, even though  -->

A mass of gold weighs 20 times more than an equal volume of water. But it might not contain 4 or 5 times more earth-aether because:
- the weight of the physical air has to be subtracted from both
- water, as a liquid, is lighter than solid bodies because of the motion of its particles


<!--   This is because the same amount must be subtracted from both due to the air in which they are weighed. 

Additionally, in the water itself, as in all other liquid bodies, there is buoyancy due to the motion of its particles relative to hard bodies. -->



#### 26. Why bodies do not gravitate in their natural places

<!-- In every motion there is a cycle of bodies moving together. 

**No body is carried downward by its own weight unless at the same moment another body, equal in size and less in weight, is carried upward.** 

This is why the lower drops of liquid in a vessel, are not pressed by the upper ones.

The individual parts of the bottom are also not pressed except by the same number of drops as rest directly above them.

For example, in the vessel `ABC`, the drop of water at 1 is not pressed by the others at 234 above it, because if these were carried downward, other drops at 567 or similar ones would have to ascend in their place; and since these are equally heavy, they prevent the descent of the former. 

However, these drops 1234, with their combined force, press on the part of the bottom at B; because if they cause it to descend, they will also descend, and in their place, parts of the air at 89, which are lighter than them, will ascend. 

But only the drops `1234` press on bottom `B`. This is because at the moment, this part B can descend, no more can follow it. From this, it is very easy to explain countless experiments about the weight of bodies, or rather, if one may so speak, gravity, which seem miraculous to those who reason poorly. -->



<!-- For example, in AT VIII-1, 216, in vessel ABC, water drop 1 is not pressed by the others 234 existing above it, 

because if this were to descend, other drops 567 or similar ones should ascend in their place; which, being equally heavy, prevent their descent. However, these drops 1234, with their combined forces, press down on the part of the bottom B; because, if they were to cause it to descend, they would descend themselves, and in their place, the lighter air parts 89, which are lighter than them, would ascend. But the same part of the vessel B is not pressed by more drops than these 1234, or others equivalent to them; because at the moment when this part B can descend, no more can follow it. And hence, countless experiments on the gravity of bodies, or rather, if one may speak so, gravitation, which seem strange to those who philosophize poorly, can be easily explained. -->

There is a circular motion in every movement of bodies that move together*. 

{{< n n="This is Descartes-Spinoza Rule 3 of Motion" >}}


**No body falls due to its gravity unless, at the same moment, another body of equal size and less gravity rises.** *

{{< n n="This is Descartes-Spinoza Rule 1 of Motion" >}}


This is why, in a vessel, no matter how deep and wide:
- the lower parts of water are only pressed by the ones directly above them
<!-- not pressed by the upper ones -->
- the parts of the bottom are only pressed by those water vertically above them. 

For example, in vessel `ABC`, the drop of water `1` is not pressed by the drops `2, 3, 4` above it. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/fig_57.jpg" alt="Vessel" >}}

This is because, if they were to fall, other drops like `5, 6, 7` would have to ascend in their place. 

Since these are equally heavy, they prevent the descent of drops `2, 3, 4`. 

However, these drops `1, 2, 3, 4`, by joining forces, press against the particles of bottom `B`. This is because, if they cause `B` to descend, they themselves will also descend. 

The parts of the air `8, 9`, which are lighter than them, will ascend in their place. 

But the same part `B` of the vessel is not pressed by more drops than these `1, 2, 3, 4` or others equivalent to them because, at the moment when this part `B` can descend, not more drops can follow. 

<!-- Hence, numerous experiments on the gravity, or rather, if one may say so, the gravitation of bodies, which seem miraculous to those who poorly understand philosophy, can be easily explained. -->



#### 27. Gravity causes bodies to descend toward the center of the Earth

The air-aether particles are simultaneously agitated by many different motions. Yet all their actions conspire together and are balanced, opposing some more than others.

**Only the mass of the Earth obstructs their movements.** 

**This is why they tend equally to move away from the Earth's mass in all directions, as if removed from its center, unless some external cause introduces a difference.** 

Such external causes can be conceived. But whether their effect is significant enough to be perceived by the senses, I have not yet discovered.

<!-- XXVII. Gravity tends to depress bodies towards the center of the Earth. Finally, it should be noted that although the particles of celestial matter are moved by many different motions at the same time, all their actions nevertheless conspire together, and as if to be in balance,

they oppose some to others, so that solely because the mass of the Earth resists their motion with its presence, they tend equally in all directions to remove themselves from its vicinity, and as if from its center; unless perhaps some external cause establishes diversity in this matter. Elzevier, p. 204 Several such causes can be imagined; but whether their effects are so great as to be perceived, is not yet known to me.\
