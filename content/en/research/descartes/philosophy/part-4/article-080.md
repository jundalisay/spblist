#### 80. The nature of fire and its distinction from air

How can flame be ignited in these cavities? What is the nature of fire?

<!-- Terrestrial particles -->

**The earth-aether, regardless of their size or shape, individually follow the motion of the fire-aether**. 

Thus, they take on the form of fire, just as they take on the form of air when floating among the air-aether globules, imitating their movement.

Therefore, the primary and principal difference between air and fire is that **the fire-aether particles are much more rapidly agitated than those of air-aether**.

The motion of the fire-aether is much faster than that of the air-aether.

The denser particles of the earth-aether, such as those constituting the vapors of liquid mercury, can assume the form of physical air. 
- But it is not necessary for their preservation. 
- On the contrary, it is purer, less prone to corruption, consisting only of the tiniest particles. 

The denser particles, unless continuously agitated by heat, naturally fall downward by their own weight and spontaneously shed the form of air. 

However, fire cannot exist without somewhat denser earth-aether particles, from which it is nourished and renewed.
<!-- terrestrial -->


#### 81. How fire is first ignited

The air-aether globules:
- occupy all the spaces around the Earth large enough to contain them.
- mutually rest on each other in such a way that they cannot move independently unless in a circular motion around their own axis

This is even though the fire-aether fills all the small spaces left by these globules and moves very rapidly within them. 

The air-aether cannot generate enough force in those places to carry away the earth-aether particles, which are all supported by:
- each other and
- the air-aether globules.

This is why the air-aether globules cannot generate fire.

To generate fire, **the air-aether globules must be expelled from the intervals between some earth-aether particles.** 

Once separated and floating freely in the fire-aether, these earth-aether particles are swiftly carried away in its motion and propelled in various directions.


#### 82. How is Fire Sustained?

To sustain this fire, the earth-aether particles must be dense, solid, and apt for motion. 

<!-- celestial  -->

This way, when propelled by the fire-aether, they have the force to keep on repelling the air-aether globules from where the fire is.

<!-- , and
- where they will  to which they are ready to return.  -->

If they stopped repelling the air-aether globules from returning to the space occupied by the fire, then those globules will break the force of the fire-aether and extinguish the fire.

<!-- This action prevents these globules from occupying the gaps left by the fire-aether initially, thereby  -->



#### 83. Why Does Fire Need Nourishment?

When these earth-aether particles strike the air-aether globules, they leave their space and turn into smoke.

This is because by leaving their space, they lose the force of the fire-aether. 

<!-- cannot be prevented by them from moving further and leaving that place, where the fire-aether primarily exerts its force, resulting in the loss of the form of fire and . -->

To sustain a fire, some of these earth-aether particles must strike a denser body to separate away some more earth-aether particles from it. 
- These new particles would then succeed the former [which will turn to smoke].
- They will be carried away by the fire-aether, continuously generating new fire.



#### 84. How Is Fire Sparked from Flint?

Flints are hard, rigid, and friable.

<!-- To better understand these processes, let us first consider various methods by which fire is generated, then examine everything required for its sustenance, and finally, assess its effects. 

Nothing is more common than to strike fire from flint, and I believe this happens because  -->

Because of their hardness and rigidity, when struck by a hard body, the spaces between many of their particles, usually occupied by air-aether globules, become narrower.

**These air-aether are compelled to spring out. They leave only the fire-aether around them.**

Due to their friability, once these particles of flint are no longer pressed by the impact, they spring apart. The fire-aether, found solely around them, composes the fire.

- `A` is flint with visible air-aether globules in its anterior particles
- `B` is the same flint when struck by a hard body. Its channels have become narrower, leaving only the fire-aether.
- `C` shows the same flint already struck, with some particles separated and having only the fire-aether around them, resulting in sparks of fire.

#### 85. How is Fire Produced from Dry Woods?

Wood will not emit sparks if struck because it is less hard.

The first part of it that encounters the striking body bends toward the second part. That second part then bends toward the third part. 

Thus, **the air-aether globules do not leave their intervals simultaneously**. 

**Instead, they depart successively, sometimes from one, sometimes from another.** 

However, if the wood is rubbed vigorously for a long time, the friction causes unequal agitation and vibration of its particles. This can shake loose the air-aether globules, separating them from each other. This action then transforms them into fire.


#### 86. How is Fire Produced from the Collection of Sunbeams?

Fire can also be ignited by directing many sunbeams through a concave mirror or convex glass onto a particular spot.

The action of these sunbeams has globules of the air-aether as their substrate. It is much more vigorous than the usual motion of these globules.

Since it originates from the fire-aether of the Sun, it has sufficient speed to ignite fire.

Additionally, so many rays can be focused at the same time that they have enough force to agitate terrestrial particles with the same speed.
