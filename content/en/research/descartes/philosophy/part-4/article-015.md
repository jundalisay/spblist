#### 15. How were these bodies generated? First, The General Motion Of Air-Aether Globules

<!-- Celestial -->
The production of material bodies on Earth depends on 4 principal actions:

1. The general motion of air-aether globules
<!-- celestial -->

2. Gravity

3. Light

4. Heat

The continuous agitation of the air-aether globules is so great that it carries:
- the Earth around the sun in a year
- things in Region 3 daily around the Earth

 <!-- but also to perform many other actions in the meantime in various ways. -->

<!-- And because, in whatever direction they begin to move in this way, they continue as much as  -->

The air-aether travels in straight lines [outwardly from the Earth's center] as much as possible. 
<!-- , or deflecting as little as possible from straight lines:  -->

And so they mix with the particles of the earth-aether to compose all the bodies of Region 3 of the Earth.
<!-- these celestial globules -->
<!-- , produce various effects in them, three of which I will note here. -->



#### 16. The first effect of air-aether motion: make bodies transparent

<!-- terrestrial -->
The air-aether in the earth-aether makes all liquid earth-aether bodies so fine that these globules are carried in all directions around them.
- This makes them transparent. 

When they move continuously through the passages of these bodies from side to side, they easily form straight or nearly straight paths. 
- These paths allow light to go through them.

<!--  suitable for the action of light in them.

 and have the power to change the positions of their particles,    -->

<!-- This is why there is  -->

Pure liquids on Earth are made up of fine particles. This is why they are transparent. 

The particlesof liquid mercury are coarser. They cannot admit the air-aether. <!--  celestial --> 
<!-- globules everywhere around them. -->

Ink, milk, blood, and the like are not pure liquids. They are interspersed with many tiny particles of solid bodies.
 
Transparent solid bodies came from transparent liquids. Their particles retained the same position that they were placed in by the air-aether globules when they were not yet fused to each other.

<!-- And as for solid bodies, it can be observed that all those  when they were formed and still liquid remained transparent, and their parts  -->

On the other hand, the particles of all opaque liquids adhere to each other by some external force. 
- They do not obey the motion of the globules of the mixed matter. 
- They have many passages left in these bodies through which air-aether globules continuously flow here and there.
  - This is because these passages are interrupted and closed in different places.
- **But they cannot transmit the action of light which needs straight or nearly straight paths.** *

#### 17. How can a solid and hard body like glass have enough passages to transmit light rays?

Think of apple-spheres enclosed in a mesh, tightly bound so that these apples, adhering to each other, form a single body.
<!-- To understand how hard bodies can have enough passages to provide a passage for light rays coming from any direction,  -->

It will contain passages through which particles can pass through. 

Pour small lead globules above it. Those globules will easily fall towards the center of the Earth in straight or nearly straight lines, due to their gravity. This is regardless of the direction this body turns.

Thus, it will be transparent, despite being solid and hard.

The air-aether globules that transmit rays of light are like these lead balls. 

<!--  celestial do not need to find straighter and more numerous passages in terrestrial bodies through which they  than the leaden globules descending between these apples. -->
