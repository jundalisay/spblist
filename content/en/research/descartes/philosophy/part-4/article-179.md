#### 179. The observations that can be made about iron filings scattered around a magnet.

<!-- If we examine more closely how iron filings arrange themselves around a magnet, we will observe many things that confirm what has been said so far.  -->

The powder of filings around a magnet does not accumulate randomly. Rather, it forms small mounds, with some of them appearing like tiny tubes.

These tubes allow the virtual photons to flow more freely than through the air.

**As a result, they indicate the paths these particles take.**

To make these paths clearly visible to the naked eye, some of the filings should be sprinkled on a surface that has a hole in which a spherical magnet is inserted in such a way that its poles touch the surface on both sides.

This is similar to how astronomers insert a straight sphere into the circle of the horizon on celestial globes to represent the Earth.

The scattered filings will then arrange themselves into tubes that exhibit the curved paths of the virtual photons around the magnet, or even around the globe representing the Earth, as described by us before.


Then insert another magnet next to the previous one, with the South pole of one magnet facing the North pole of the other.
- These 2 magnets will act as if they were a single one.
- The scattered filings will also change around them as one magnet.
  - This demonstrates how the virtual photons move through the 2 magnets as one magnet


The tubes that extend from one pole to the other will be straight.

Those that connect opposing poles will bend around the magnets, such as the lines `NRVXTs` shown here.

When a piece of iron filings is suspended from one magnet, let's say the South pole, and the South pole of another magnet placed below it is turned towards it and gradually approached, the tubes made from the filings initially retract and bend upwards.

This happens because the virtual photons flowing through them are repelled by the ones coming from the lower magnet. 

Then, if this lower magnet is much stronger than the upper one, these tubes will dissolve. The filings will fall towards the lower magnet. 

This occurs because the ascending virtual photons from the lower magnet exert force on each individual particle of the filings. Those particles cannot enter unless they adhere to the same surfaces to which the upper magnet adheres, causing them to separate from the upper magnet. 

Conversely, if the South pole of the upper magnet, to which the filings adhere, is turned towards the North pole of the lower magnet, the filings align their tubes directly towards the lower magnet and extend them as much as possible.

This happens because the particles flowing from either magnet provide a pathway for the other. But they are not separated from the upper magnet unless they first come into contact with the lower one due to the force of contact we discussed earlier.

Due to this same force, if the iron filings adhering to a magnet, no matter how strong, are touched by a weaker magnet or even just a piece of iron, some of its parts will leave the stronger magnet and follow the weaker one or the iron.

This happens because the parts that touch the stronger magnet with a larger surface area than the other will adhere to it more strongly. 

Since these surfaces of the filings are small and uneven, it always happens that some particles of the filings connect more strongly to one magnet or iron than to another.



#### 180. Why does an iron plate attached to a magnet hinder its force of attraction or reversal of iron?

The iron plate, when brought near the pole of a magnet, not only increases its force of sustaining iron, as mentioned before, but also impedes its ability to attract or reverse the polarity of iron. 

Specifically, the plate `DCD` prevents the magnet `AB`, to which it is attached, from attracting or reversing the polarity of iron filings represented by EF. This is because we observe that the striated particles that would normally move from B towards EF are reflected by this plate from point C towards the edges DD. 

This occurs because they can flow more freely through the plate than through the air, making it difficult for them to reach the accumulation EF. 

Similarly, only a few particles manage to reach us from the central region of the Earth. 

This is because most of them reverse their direction from one pole to another as they pass through the inner crust of the Earth's upper region.

As a result, only a weak magnetic force from the entire Earth is felt here with us.



#### 181. Why does the interposition of any other body hinder it?

But besides iron or magnet, no other body can be placed in the position of the plate `CD` that would hinder the magnet `AB` from exerting its force on the accumulation `EF`. 

In this outer Earth, we do not have any substance, no matter how solid and hard, that does not contain numerous channels. 

These channels are not formed to the size of the striated particles, but much larger, capable of accommodating even the air-aether globules.

Through these channels, the striated particles can pass as freely as through the air, as the air itself contains these globules of the second element.



#### 182. Why does an improper positioning of the magnet gradually weaken its powers?

If iron or a magnet is held in a position different from its natural alignment towards the Earth or other nearby magnets for a long time, it gradually loses its strength. 

This occurs because the striated particles, which come from the Earth or other nearby magnets, encounter the magnet's channels obliquely or in a reversed manner, gradually altering and corrupting their arrangement.

When a magnet or a piece of iron is allowed to align itself freely, its magnetic domains and magnetic moments naturally arrange in a harmonious manner, maximizing its magnetic strength. 

However, if it is forcibly held or positioned in a different orientation, the incoming striated particles from the Earth or nearby magnets intersect the channels of the magnet at irregular angles. 

This interaction gradually distorts and disrupts the alignment of the magnetic domains and moments within the magnet, leading to a loss of its magnetic power over time.

In essence, the prolonged obstruction of a magnet's natural alignment by holding it in a different position causes the incoming striated particles to interfere with its channels in a non-optimal way, gradually altering and corrupting the magnet's magnetic properties, resulting in a decrease in its overall strength.


#### 183. Why does rust, moisture, and exposure also diminish them, and intense heat completely remove them?

The magnetic force is:
- greatly diminished by moisture, rust, and exposure
- completely destroyed by intense heat

Moisture and exposure to the air facilitate the formation of rust in iron particles. This rust then clogs the channels' openings.

Intense heat, on the other hand, completely disrupts the positioning of these particles. 

<!-- So far, I believe there has been no conclusive and certain observation regarding magnets that can be easily understood based on the explanations I have provided. -->
