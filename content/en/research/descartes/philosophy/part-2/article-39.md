#### 39. The Second law of nature: Every motion in itself is straight. Things which move in a circular manner  always tend to move away from the center of the circle which they describe.


The second law of nature is: each particle of matter, considered separately, moves only along straight lines.

Many are often forced to deflect due to encounters with others.

All the matter moving together forms a circular pattern. 

This has the same cause as the First Law -- the immutability and simplicity of how God preserves motion in matter.

He preserves it precisely every time, without any consideration of what it might have been earlier.

No motion happens in an instant. Yet everything which is moved, in each instant while it is being moved, continues its motion in a straight line, never along a curved line. 

<!-- For example, the stone A, rotated in the sling EA through the circle ABF, at the instant when it is at point A, is indeed determined to move towards some part, namely according to the straight line towards C, so that the straight line AC is the tangent of the circle. However, it cannot be imagined to be determined towards any curved motion: for although it previously came from L to A through a curved line, nothing of that curvature can be understood to remain in it while it is at point A. And this is also confirmed by experience, because if it then exits the sling, it does not continue to move towards B, but towards C. From this it follows that any body which moves in a circular manner perpetually tends to move away from the center of the circle it describes. As we experience with our very senses in the case of a stone, while we whirl it around in a sling. And because this consideration will often be used in what follows, it will be diligently noted and more fully explained below." -->


For example, let `A` be a stone rotating in the sling `DA` through the circle `ABF`.

 When it is at the point `A`, it moves along line towards `C`, so that the straight line `AC` is a tangent to the circle. 

<!-- before from L to A -->
But it cannot be supposed to be determined to any curved motion. Although it came along a curved line, this curvature does not remain in it while it is at the point `A`. 

This is also confirmed by experience, because if it then leaves the sling, it will not continue to move toward `B`, but towards `C`. 

From which it follows that every body which is moved circularly tends perpetually to recede from the center of the circle which it describes. 

We experience this by the very sense of touch in a stone while we whirl it around in the sling. 



<!-- #### 40. The third law: when one body meets another stronger, it loses nothing of its motion; in encountering a less strong man, he loses as much as he transfers into it.

The third law of nature is this: When a body in motion encounters another, if it has less force to proceed in a straight line than the other has to resist it, then it is deflected in another direction and, while retaining its motion, loses only the determination of its motion. 

But if it has greater force, then it moves the other body with it and loses as much of its own motion as it imparts to it. 

Thus we experience that any hard bodies projected, when they strike another hard body, do not cease from motion but are reflected toward the opposite side; on the contrary, when they encounter a soft body, because they easily transmit all their motion to it, they are immediately reduced to rest. 

All the particular causes of changes that happen to bodies are contained in this third law, at least those that are bodily.

The power that minds, whether human or angelic, have in moving bodies is discussed in my Treatise on Man.

#### 40. The Third Law: A body does not lose its motion when it encounters a more powerful body. But it transfers some of its motion when it encounters a less powerful body

Body `weak` has less force than body `strong`. If `weak`, moving in a straight line, hits `strong`, then `weak` will be deflected, retaining its motion but losing its direction.*

{{< n n="This explains friction when the deflected object is not allowed to fully deflect because of the irregulatrity of the surfaces" >}}

 <!-- determination of its motion;  -->

But if `strong` were moving and hits `weak`, then `strong` will move `weak` with it. `strong` will lose as much of its own motion as it gives to `weak`. 

Thus, when hard bodies are projected and strike another hard body, they do not stop moving. Instead, they are reflected to the opposite direction.

On the contrary, when they encounter a soft body, they can easily transfer all their motion to it. This stops them. 

All the changes which happen to corporeal bodies are contained in this Third Law.

I do not look here into what force human or angelic minds have for moving bodies. That will be discussed in the Treatise on Man.
