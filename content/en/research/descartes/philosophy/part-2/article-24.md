#### 24. What is motion?

There is only local motion*. Local motion is the action by which a body **migrates** from one place to another. 

{{< n n="We call this sequential or linear or relative motion where the body moves from point `A` to `E` by going through points `B`, `C`, `D` consecutively or successively. Whether the body is moving or not depends on viewspace (reference frame to Einstein)" >}}

<!-- n n="Descartes' classical locality is totally different from modern locality which is really Einstein locality. Classical Locality is a philosphical concept applied to Physics. It asserts that there is is no void -- things affect each other through an immaterial medium called the aether. Einstein Locality is a sophistical concept arising from Einstein's invention of a material spacetime that limits everything to the speed of light. We assert that the Bell Theorem totally debunks Einstein's Relativity which imposes Einstein's Locality (spacetime fabric) and Realism (hidden variables). The successful tests of General Relativity, much applauded by Physicists, are merely tests of equipment." >}} -->
 

Therefore, the same body changes place [from one perspective] and does not change place [from another perspective] at the same time.

Thus, it can also be said to be moving [from one perspective] and not moving [from another perspective] .

For example, one who sits in a ship departing from port thinks he is moving if he looks at the shores. 
- But he is not moving if he looks at the ship itself which he is a part of.

We commonly think that there is:
- action in all motion
- no action in rest

The person thus seated is more properly said to be at rest than in motion, seeing he is not conscious* of being in action.

{{< n n="This destroys the assertion of General Relativity that everything is in motion. Whether a thing is moving depends on viewspace (reference frame in Relativity). From a universal viewspace, everything is moving. But from the viewspace of my room, my books, tables, and chairs are not moving, and only the fish in the aquarium is moving." >}}


<!-- But motion (viz., local, for I can conceive no other kind of motion, and therefore I do not think we ought to suppose there is any other in nature), in the ordinary sense of the term, is nothing more than  -->

<!-- Ordinary motion is the action by which a body passes from one place to another. 

The same thing may change but not to change place at the same time.

The same thing is at the same time moved and not moved. 

For example, a person seated in a vessel which is setting sail, thinks he is in motion if he look to the shore and consider it as fixed.

But he is not in motion if he regarded the ship itself, among the parts of which he preserves always the same situation. 

We are accustomed to suppose that:
- there is no motion without action
- in rest, there is the cessation of action


 But if, instead of occupying ourselves with that which has no foundation, unless in ordinary usage, we desire to know what ought to be understood by motion according to the truth of the thing, we may say, in order to give it a determinate nature, that it is  -->


#### 25. What is true motion?

True motion is **THE TRANSLATION OF A WHOLE BODY (with its particles) FROM THE VICINITY OF THOSE BODIES AT REST THAT ARE IN IMMEDIATE CONTACT WITH IT, to the vicinity of other bodies**.

The body might consist of many particles which have other motions within themselves. 

**True motion is a translation, not a force or action that transfers. Therefore, true motion is always in the moving object, not in the mover.**
- This is because these two are not usually distinguished accurately.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/effort.jpg" a="True Motion" c="Cartesian True Motion is the foundation of action-at-a-distance, as force-less levitation and teleportation. Local or relative motion may or may not focus on the mover, but true motion focuses on the movee" >}}


Motion is merely a mode of the body just as:
- shape is the mode of a shaped thing
- rest is the mode of a resting thing.

**It is not an inherent quality.**


<!-- translation of one part of matter, or one body, from the vicinity of those bodies which immediately touch it and are considered as at rest, to the vicinity of others. Here by one body, or one part of matter, I mean everything that is transferred together; although this itself may consist of many parts, which have other motions within themselves. And I say it is a translation, not a force or action that transfers, to show that it is always in the moving object, not in the mover, because these two are not usually distinguished accurately enough; and it is merely its mode, not a subsisting thing, just as shape is the mode of a shaped thing, and rest is the mode of a resting thing. -->

<!-- 'A body as a part of matter' means all that is transferred together, although it is perhaps composed of several parts, which in themselves have other motions.

It is **the transporting and not the force or action which transports**.
- This is to emphasize that **motion is always in the movable thing, not in that which moves.**
- I emphasize this because we are not accustomed to distinguish these two things with sufficient accuracy.

It is a mode of the movable thing, and not a substance, just as shape is a property of the thing shaped, and repose is a property of that which is at rest.
