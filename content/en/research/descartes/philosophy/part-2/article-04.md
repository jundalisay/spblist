### 4. The nature of body consists not in weight hardness, colour and the like, but in extension alone*

{{< n n="Descartes reiterates that the nature of matter is it occupying metaphysical space. From now, we will replace 'extension' with 'metaphysical space' to distinguish it from 'space' as physical space" >}}

<!-- In this way, we will discern that  -->

The nature of matter or body in general does not consist in anything sensory. 

The nature of matter or body is in it being an [aethereal] substance extended in length, width, and height.


<!-- its being hard, or ponderous, or coloured, or that which affects our senses in any other way, but simply in its being a substance   -->

Hardness is just the ability of hard bodies to resist the motion of our hands on coming into contact with them.

<!-- , we know nothing of it by sense farther than that the parts of  -->

But if all bodies moved away from our hands whenever we tried to touch them, then we would never experience hardness.

 <!-- every time our hands moved towards any part, all the bodies in that place moved away as quickly as our hands approached,  -->

Yet those bodies would still be bodies to us. 

Therefore, the nature of bodies does not include hardness. 

<!-- Yet we have no reason to believe that bodies which might thus recede would on this account lose that which makes them bodies.  -->

<!-- The nature of body does not, therefore, consist in hardness.  -->

In the same way, weight, colour, and all the other qualities of this sort, which are perceived in corporeal matter, can be removed from matter entirely. 

 <!-- may be taken from it, itself meanwhile remaining entire:  -->

It follows that the nature of body depends on none of these.


### Compressed Versus Decompressed Bodies*

 <!-- Rarefaction -->
{{< n n="We replace rarefaction with 'decompression' and condensation with 'compression'. This is to better associate with 'pressure' from the Negative Force." >}}


#### 5. The nature of body as extension is obscured by the opinions on decompression and vacuum.

<!-- with which we are pre-occupied. extension-->

Two reasons prevent the acceptance of the truth that the nature of body consists in metaphysical space alone. 

<!-- Many people think that 

The first is the prevalent opinion, that  -->

<!-- most bodies can be so rarefied and condensed. rarefied extension condensed-->

1. Some bodies can become very much decompressed and very much compressed

When decompressed, bodies have greater metaphysical space than when compressed. 

Some even have subtilized to the point that they make a distinction:
- between the substance of body and its quantity 
- between quantity itself and metaphysical space.


2. We think of extension or metaphysical space as length, width, and height. 

<!-- , we are not in the habit of saying that body is there, void space -->

People think that void is merely a negation of space.

<!-- but only space and further  rarefaction-->


#### 6. How does decompression take place?

If we watch our own thoughts, we will discover that the decompression and compression of an idea-body is **merely a change of shape** in the decompressed or compressed body.

<!-- and admits nothing of which he is not clearly conscious, will not suppose that there is anything in those processes further than  -->

<!-- In other words, rare bodies have more numerous distances between their parts filled with other bodies.  -->

In other words:
- decompressed bodies **have more gaps** between their particles
 <!-- that are filled with other bodies. -->
- compressed or dense bodies, on the other hand, **have less or no gaps** between their particles.


{{< i s="/graphics/meta/space.jpg" a="Space versus Metaphysical Space" c="The idea of the object takes up no physical space" >}}


<!-- are those whose parts approach each other, either diminish these distances or removing them. -->
 <!-- wholly away, in the latter of which cases the body is rendered absolutely dense.  -->

The body, however, does not have less metaphysical space when compressed than when its particles occupy more physical space.

<!-- , owing to their removal from each other, and their dispersion into branches. -->

The idea-body of an object does not expand when it is decompressed by the mind. Instead, other idea-bodies fill in those gaps that are created by the decompression.   

<!-- We should not to attribute to it the extension of the pores or distances which its parts do not occupy when it is rarefied, but to the other bodies that fill these interstices. -->

A sponge full of water is different from a dry sponge because the wet sponge has wider pores. 
- This makes its body more diffused over a larger physical space.
- But this does not mean that each sponge-particle has greater metaphysical space when wet than when dry

 <!-- each part of the sponge have greater extension than when compressed and dry -->
<!-- , but only that its pores are wider, and therefore that the  -->


#### 7. Decompression should only be thought in that way
<!-- Rarefaction cannot be intelligibly explained unless in the way here proposed. -->

<!-- I am unable to discover the force of the reasons which have induced  -->

Some say that the decompression of an idea-body is the result of the augmentation of the quantity of body.
- I say no, and explain that this augmentation is an example of the sponge.
<!-- , rather than to explain it on the principle exemplified in the case of a sponge.  -->

When air or water is decompressed, we do not see:
- any of its pores that become large, or
- any new body that is added to occupy them.

But we still suppose that there is something unintelligible happening, so that we can explain the decompression of bodies.
- This is better than inventing the concept of a new body that fills the pores or distances between the particles which are increased in physical size.

 <!-- , than to conclude, because of their rarefaction, that there are  , and filled with some new body. -->

<!-- Nor should we refrain from assenting to this explanation, because we perceive this new body by none of our senses, for there is no reason which obliges us to believe that we should perceive by our senses all the bodies in 

Our senses cannot perceive all bodies in existence. -->

Any other explanation will create a contradiction. 
 <!-- extension -->

If we say that a new body filled up that metaphysical space, then it means that there suddenly is something that did not exist before.  


<!-- - It will suppose that any body was increased by a quantity or metaphysical space which it did not have before, -->

 <!-- without the addition to it of a new extended substance, in other words, of another body, because it is impossible to conceive any addition of extension or quantity to a thing without supposing the addition of a substance having quantity or extension -->

<!-- , as will more clearly appear from what follows. -->

<!-- We see that it is very easy to explain rarefaction in this manner, but impossible in any other; for, in fine, there would be, as appears to me, a manifest contradiction in  -->
