<!-- XLI. Proof of the First Part of this Rule.

The first part of this Law is demonstrated from the fact that there is a difference between motion considered in itself, and the determination of that motion to a certain part; so that this determination can be changed, the motion itself remaining. For since, as was said before, every simple thing, such as motion is, always persists, as long as it is not destroyed by any external cause; and in the encounter with a hard body, there appears indeed a cause which prevents the motion of the other body it encounters from remaining determined towards the same part; but there is no cause which takes away or diminishes the motion itself, because motion is not contrary to motion; hence it follows that it ought not to be diminished on that account. -->


#### 41. Proof of the first part of this third rule.

The first part is demonstrated by the difference between motion considered in itself and its direction. 
- This direction can be changed while the motion remains unchanged.*

{{< n n="This is primarily used for light particles (Radiant layer in Superphysics)" >}}

This is because motion is a simple uncompounded thing. And so, it always perseveres as long as it is not destroyed by any external cause. 

In the collision of a hard body, the resistance of that hard body prevents the moving body from remaining in the same direction.

   <!-- a cause appears to prevent the motion of the other body it encounters from .  -->

But there is no cause which removes or reduces the motion itself.

This is because motion is not contrary to motion. Hence, it should not be reduced.

 <!-- for that reason. -->

#### 42. Proof of the Second Part

The other part is also demonstrated by the immutability of God's operation, conserving the world now with the same action with which He once created it.

All things are filled with bodies. 

Yet the motion of each body tends in a straight line.

God from the start:
- moved its various particles in different ways
- arranged them so that some particles would impel others and transfer their motions to them.

He conserves motion not by keeping motions of the particles of matter always fixed, but by letting those motions pass from one to another as they encounter each other.

 <!-- : so that now, by conserving it with the same action and with the same laws with which He created it, He  -->
**Thus, this continuous alteration of creatures itself is an argument for the immutability of God.**


<!-- The latter part is also demonstrated from the immutability of the operation of God, who continually preserves the world by the same action by which He once created it. For since all things are full of bodies, and nevertheless the motion of each body tends in a straight line, it is clear that God, in creating the world from the beginning, not only moved its different parts in different ways, but also caused some to impel others, and to transfer their motions to them: so that now, in preserving it by the same action, and with the same laws by which He created it, He maintains the motion not always fixed in the same parts of matter, but passing from some to others, as they encounter each other. And so this very continuous change of creatures is an argument of the immutability of God. -->


#### 43. Where does the power of every body to act or to resist come from?

<!-- Here, however, it must be carefully noted in what the force of each body consists in acting upon another or in resisting the action of another: namely, in this one thing, that  -->

This power to act or resist comes from nature of each body to remain in the same state.

 <!-- in which it is, according to the law set forth in the first place.  -->

This means that:
- whatever is connected to another has some force to prevent itself from being separated
- whatever is separated has the force to remain separated
- whatever is at rest has the force to persist in its rest, and resist all those things which could change it [and make it move]
- whatever is in motion has force to persist in its motion.

<!-- , that is, in a motion of the same swiftness and toward the same part.  -->

That force should be estimated by:

1. The magnitude of the body
2. The surface by which that body is separated from another
3. The swiftness of motion
4. The nature and mode of opposition in which different bodies encounter each other.


#### 44. That motion is not the opposite of motion, but of rest; and determination in one direction against determination in the opposite direction.

One motion is not contrary to another motion of equal speed.

There are properly only 2 kinds of opposition found here:

1. One between motion and rest, or even between the fast and slow

<!-- inasmuch as this slowness participates in the nature of rest;  -->

2. One between one direction of motion towards a body at rest and another direction from the actual encounter with that body. 

<!-- a certain part and the encounter of a body at rest or otherwise moved in that part, and

according to the proportion of the part toward which the encountering body is moved, this opposition is greater or lesser. -->
