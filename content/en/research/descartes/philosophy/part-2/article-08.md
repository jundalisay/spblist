{{< n n="Here, we replace substance with idea" >}}


<!-- IX. The corporeal substance, when distinguished from its quantity, is confusedly conceived as incorporeal. And although perhaps some may say otherwise, I do not think they perceive anything else; but when they distinguish substance from extension or quantity, they either understand nothing by the term substance, or have only a confused idea of incorporeal substance, which they falsely attribute to the corporeal, leaving the true idea of this corporeal substance to extension, which they nevertheless call an accident: and thus they express something quite different from what they comprehend in their mind.

X. What space or internal place is. Neither does space or internal place differ in reality from corporeal substance contained in it, but only in the mode by which we are accustomed to conceiving them. For in fact the extension in length, width and depth, which constitutes space, is exactly the same as that which constitutes body. But the difference is that we consider the extension in the body as particular, and think it always changes whenever the body changes; whereas in space we attribute to it only a generic unity, so that when the body filling the space is changed, the extension of the space is not considered to change, but to remain one and the same, as long as it retains the same size and shape, and preserves the same position among certain external bodies by which that space is determined.

XI. How it does not differ from corporeal substance. And indeed we shall easily recognize that the same extension constitutes the nature of body and the nature of space, and that these two do not differ from each other any more than the nature of a genus or species differs from the nature of an individual; if, considering the idea we have of some body, for example a stone, we reject from it everything that we know does not belong to the nature of the body: for example, we first reject hardness, because if the stone were melted or reduced to the smallest particles, it would lose that quality without ceasing to be a body; we also reject color, because we have often seen stones so transparent that they had no color; we reject weight, because although fire is very light, it is no less considered a body; and finally we reject cold, heat, and all other qualities, because they are either not considered in the stone, or, their being changed, the stone is not thought to have lost the nature of a body. For thus we shall observe that nothing remains in its idea but that it is something extended in length, width and depth; which is the same as is contained in the idea of space, not only that filled with bodies, but also that which is called void.

XII. How it differs in the mode of conceiving it. But the difference is in the mode of conceiving it, for when the stone is removed from the space or place where it was, we think that its extension is also removed, as we regard it as particular and inseparable from it: but we believe the extension of the place where the stone was to remain the same, and to be the same, even though that place of the stone is now occupied by wood, or water, or air, or any other body, or is even believed to be empty. Because there the extension is considered generically, and it is considered the same for the stone, the wood, the water, the air, and other bodies, or even for the void itself, if any exists, provided only that it is of the same size and shape, and preserves the same position among the external bodies that determine that space. -->


#### 8. Quantity and number differ only in our minds

 <!-- (RATIONE)  -->

Conversely, the number ten can be understood, as well as the continuous quantity of ten feet, even if we do not attend to that determinate substance: because the concept of the number ten is plainly the same, whether it is referred to this measure of ten feet or to anything else.

The continuous quantity of ten feet, although it cannot be understood without some extended substance of which it is the quantity, can nevertheless be understood without this determinate substance. 

But in reality, it cannot happen that the smallest part of this quantity or extension be removed without an equal part also being taken away from the substance; nor conversely, that the smallest part of the substance be removed without an equal part of quantity and extension also being taken away.



<!-- from that which has quantity and is numbered -->

<!-- **Quantity differs from extended substance, and number from what is numbered, not in reality but merely in our thought.** -->

The following are different only in our minds, but not in physical reality:
- Actual quantity-thought versus metaphysical quantity-idea
- Actual numbered-thought versus metaphysical number-idea

For example, we see a log that we estimate to measure 10 feet.*
- The 10-feet-estimate is our thought of its occupied space which is different from our ideal [substance] of 10 feet of space.
- Yet we do not make a distinction between both because the 10-foot-idea is understood to represent the 10-foot-estimate 

{{< n n="This is spacetime">}}

Conversely, the idea of 10 feet* can be understood without looking at the log. This is even if the 10 feet needs a representation of something so that the idea of 10 feet can be understood [in discussion?].  

{{< n n="This is timespace">}}

But in reality, the following cannot happen:
- the smallest part of this quantity-thought is only removed when an equal part is also removed from the quantity-idea 
- the smallest part of the quantity-idea is only removed when  an equal part is also removed from the quantity-thought 
 <!-- cannot be removed without an equal part also being taken away from the substance; nor  -->

- conversely, that the smallest part of the substance be removed without 

 and extension also being taken away.


 without thinking of this determinate substance, we can conceive both*:
- the number 10
- 10 feet (as a continuous quantity)

 <!-- of 10 feet, .  -->



This is because the concept of the number 10 is the same in 10 feet, 10 things, etc. 

 <!-- whether we consider a number of 10 feet or 10 of anything else. -->

We can conceive a continuous quantity of 10 feet without thinking of this or that determinate substance, 

Although we cannot conceive 10 feet without some extended substance of which it is the quantity. 

It is in reality, however, impossible that any, even the least part, of such quantity or extension, can be taken away, without the retrenchment at the same time of as much of the substance, nor, on the other hand, can we lessen the substance, without at the same time taking as much from the quantity or extension.


<!-- ### 9. Corporeal substance, wh
  en distinguished from its quantity, is confusedly conceived as something incorporeal. -->

<!-- Although perhaps some express themselves otherwise on this matter, I am nevertheless convinced that they do not think differently from what I have now said: for -->

<!-- When people distinguish (corporeal) substance from extension or quantity, they either:
- mean nothing by the word (corporeal) substance, or
- form in their minds merely a confused idea of incorporeal substance, which they falsely attribute to corporeal, and leave to extension the true idea of this corporeal substance
  - This extension they call an accident, but with such impropriety as to make it easy to discover that their words are not in harmony with their thoughts. -->



### 9. The corporeal substance, when distinguished from its number, is confusedly thought of as incorporeal.

<!-- Physical matter, when distinguished from metaphysical quantity, is confusedly conceived as something metaphysical.

When people distinguish physical matter from metaphysical space or number, they either:
- mean nothing by the word "physical matter", or
- form in their minds merely a confused idea of metaphysical substance, which they falsely think to be physical. 

Then they leave to metaphysical space the true idea of this physical matter.
- This metaphysical space they call an accident. But this means that their words are not in harmony with their thoughts.   -->

<!-- And although perhaps some may say otherwise, I do not think they perceive anything else; but  -->

People who distinguish substance from size or number actually do not know what incorporeal substance means. 
- They think that substance is physical. 

They thus think that a corporeal substance has a [metaphysical] size which they nevertheless call an accident.

And so they express something quite different from what they comprehend in their mind.


#### 10. What is space or internal place?


<!-- corporeal substance -->
Space or internal place, and the physical matter in it, are not different in reality.

They are merely different in the mode conceived by us. 

The same extension in length, width, and height, which constitutes space, constitutes body.

<!-- Their only difference is that **in body, we consider extension as particular, and conceive it to change with the body**. Whereas in space **we attribute a generic unity to extension**. -->

Their only difference is that **we see the space occupied by the body as different from the body**. Whereas we see space **to be united to extension**.

- After a body has occupied a space, we know that the extension of that space was not removed at the same time. The same extension remains there so long as it is of the same size and shape, and preserves the same location relative to certain bodies around it, by means of which we determine this space.

<!-- - After taking from a certain space the body which occupied it, we do not suppose that we have at the same time removed the extension of the space. This is because it appears to us that the same extension remains there so long as it is of the same magnitude and shape, and preserves the same location relative to certain bodies around it, by means of which we determine this space. -->


## Physical Space Versus Metaphysical Space

#### 11. Space, in reality, is not different from corporeal substance

It is the same extension which constitutes the nature of body as of space.

These 2 things are mutually diverse only as the nature of the genus and species differs from that of the individual, provided we reflect on the idea we have of any body.

For example, we think of a stone.
- We reject all that is not essential to the nature of the body of a stone. 

We can reject:
- hardness 
  - This is because if the stone were liquefied or reduced to powder, it would no longer have hardness. Yet it  would still be a body.
- colour
  - This is because we have frequently seen stones so transparent as to have no colour. 
- weight
  - This is because we have the case of fire. Fire is very light. But it is still a body.
- temperature
  - They are not considered as in the stone
  - A change of temperature does not cause the stone to lose its nature as a body. 

After this examination, we find that nothing remains in the idea of body, except that it is something extended in length, width, and depth.
- This something is comprised in our idea of space, not only of that which is full of body, but even of 'void space'.



#### 12. Space differs from body in our mode of conceiving it.

There is, however, some difference between them in the mode of conception.

If we remove a stone from the place where it was, we see that its extension [of stone] is also taken away. This is because we regard its extension as particular and inseparable from the stone itself.

But the same extension of place where this stone was remains, even if that place is now occupied by air or even if it is vacant.

 <!-- wood, water, air, or by any other body, or be even supposed vacant, because  -->

This makes us consider extension in general. 

We think that the same extension is common to stones, wood, water, air, and other bodies, even to a vacuum itself, provided it:
- be of the same magnitude and shape as before, and 
- preserve the same situation among the external bodies which determine this space.
