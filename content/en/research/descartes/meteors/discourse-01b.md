All terrestrial bodies have many pores through which these smaller particles can pass through.
- But several have pores so narrow or constricted that they do not accept the larger particles.
- These usually feel the coldest when touched or even when approached. 

Marble and metals feel colder than wood because their pores do not easily accept the less subtle particles of the fire-aether.
- Ice is colder than metals because its pores accept the fire-aether even less than those of metals.

<!-- For I suppose here that for cold and heat, there is no need to conceive anything other than that  -->

This is because:
- Heat is the small particles of the bodies that we touch being agitated more strongly than usual.
- Cold is them being agitated less than usual.*

{{< n n="This is proven in supercooled superconductors that offer no electric resistatnce -- because there is no more counter agitation from the supercooled matter. No agitation of matter therefore leads to cold temperature universally, and straight channels for magnetism selectively. This leads to the ability to increase or reduce agitation by the aether instead of by radiant energy." >}}


This agitation can be caused by the small particles of the fire-aether.
- **This agitation transfers to the small filaments of our nerves that are the organs of touch.** 
 <!-- or by any other cause. -->

<!-- When they agitate them more strongly than usual, it causes in us the sensation of heat.

; whereas when they agitate them less strongly, it causes the sensation of cold.  -->


### The States of Matter: Water and Ice

The particles of hard bodies are like intertwined branches.
- This fire-aether does not separate those particles in the same way that it does those of water and liquids. 

But it nonetheless agitates and makes them tremble according to:
- how strong its movement is
- how large its particles are

This is like how the wind can agitate all the branches of shrubs that form a hedge without removing them from their places.

There is a proportion between:
- the force of this fire-aether
- the resistance of the particles of bodies

Ice turns into water when it is more agitated.

This agitation can come from the larger fire-aether particles that are near the surface of the earth [at sea level]. These larger fire-aether particles then have the force to:
- agitate and move the ice particles separately from one another
- bend most of the small particles of the water among which it slips, thus making it liquid. 

Water turns into ice when it becomes less agitated.

This lesser agitation can come from the subtler fire-aether, such as those that are in the atmosphere, or during winter.
- The fire-aether then does not have enough force to bend and agitate the water particles. 
- This causes the water to remain confusedly joined and laid one on top of the other, creating a hard body as ice. 

The difference between water and ice is like the difference between eels:
- floating in a fisherman's boat full of holes through which the river water passes and agitates them, and
- the same eels dry and stiff with cold on the shore. 

Water only freezes when the fire-aether between its particles is more subtle than usual.

It follows that the pores of such ice are arranged in such a way that they cannot accept the larger and less subtle fire-aether.

<!-- that form then, being accommodated only to the size of the more subtle parts of this matter,  -->

Thus, the ice is always very cold, even when kept until summer. It retains its hardness without gradually softening like wax, because the heat only penetrates inside as the surface becomes liquid.
