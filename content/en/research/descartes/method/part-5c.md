The animal spirits are like a very subtle wind, or a very pure and vivid flame. 
- It continually rises in great abundance from the heart to the brain*.

{{< n n="From the external spacetime particles to the heart up to the brain, the animal spirits are pranah or vital energy. The animal spirits get crudified in the brain from where it is sent throughout the body where it manifests as the nerve impulses traveling through the anthakarana. Telekinesis is the channeling of the spacetime particles from the heart directly through the body and back to the external space as to create movement. This requires a breathing technique to energize the heart. Spacetime particles also contain the aether and so extra-sensory information can also be derived from spacetime." >}}
  

From the brain, it penetrates through the nerves into the muscles, and moves all the parts. 

This is why the most agitated and penetrating blood are the fittest to compose these spirits going towards the brain, 

<!-- the arteries which carry them directly to brain from the heart  -->

The rules of mechanics are the same with those of nature.

When many objects tend at once to the same point where there is insufficient room for all, the weaker and less agitated parts are driven aside from that point by the stronger.. An example is the blood flowing to the brain from the left cavity of the heart.

 <!-- which alone in this way reach it I had expounded all these matters with sufficient minuteness in the treatise which I formerly thought of publishing. -->

My Treatise explains the following:

- The fabric of the nerves and muscles gives the animal spirits contained in it the power to move the members. This is seen in the heads of people that have been decapitated still able to move and bite the earth, although no longer animated.
- What changes must take place in the brain to produce waking, sleep, and dreams?
- How do light, sounds, odours, tastes, heat, and all the other qualities of external objects impress it with different ideas through the senses?
- How does hunger, thirst, and the other internal affections can likewise impress upon it diverse ideas?
- What is the common sense (sensus communis) that receives these ideas?
- What is the memory which retains them?
- What is the imagination which can change them in various ways, and out of them compose new ideas?
- How can the imagination distribute the animal spirits through the muscles and  cause the body to move?

 <!-- , and in a manner as suited, whether to the objects that are presented to its senses or to its internal affections, as can take place in our own case apart from the guidance of the will.  -->

This will not be strange to those who know the variety of movements by the different automata, or moving machines fabricated by human industry.

<!-- , and that with help of but few pieces compared with the great multitude of bones, muscles, nerves, arteries, veins, and other parts that are found in the body of each animal.  -->

Our body is a machine made by the hands of God, which is incomparably better arranged than any machine of human invention.

If our bodies had exactly the organs and outward form an ape or any other irrational animal, then we would not be different from them. 

 <!-- have no means of knowing that they were in any respect of a different nature from these animals;  -->

But if those bodies were like ours capable of imitating our actions as far as it is morally possible, then there would be 2 tests to prove whether they were human. 

 <!-- still remain two most certain tests whereby to know that they were not therefore really men.  -->

1. They could never use words or other signs arranged in order to communicate our thoughts to others.

A machine can be so constructed to emit words. [Am example is a parrot]

 <!-- vocables, and even that it emits some correspondent to the action upon it of external objects which cause a change in its organs;  -->

<!-- For example, if touched in a particular place it may demand what we wish to say to it; if in another it may cry out that it is hurt, and such like;  -->

But such a machine cannot arrange those words to create a valid reply as when men of the lowest grade of intellect can do. 

2. Such bodies would fail in certain actions that required knowledge, instead of the disposition of their organs.

<!-- The second test is, that although such machines might execute many things with equal or perhaps greater perfection than any of us, they would, without doubt, -->

<!-- from which it could be discovered that they did not act from knowledge, but solely from  -->

Reason, the universal instrument for knowledge, is not present in the organs. 

<!-- that is alike available on every occasion, these organs, on the contrary, need a particular arrangement for each particular action; whence it must be morally impossible that there should exist in any machine a diversity of organs sufficient to enable it to act in all the occurrences of life, in the way in which our reason enables us to act.  -->

These two tests can let us know the difference between men and brutes.

All men, even idiots, can join together different words to make their thoughts understood.
- On the other hand, no animals can do the same.

This inability does not arise from lack of organs. Magpies and parrots can utter words like ourselves. But they are unable to speak as we do and show that they understand what they say.

<!-- ; in place of which men born deaf and dumb, and thus not less, but rather more than the brutes, destitute of the organs which others use in speaking, are in the habit of spontaneously inventing certain signs by which they discover their thoughts to those who, being usually in their company, have leisure to learn their language. -->

**This proves that animals have less reason than man, but that they have none at all.** Very little is required for a person to speak.

The soul of brutes are of a nature totally different from ours because:
- a certain inequality of capacity is observable among animals of the same species, as well as among men
- some are more capable of being instructed than others

If they were the same then the most perfect ape or parrot should be equal to the most stupid human infant.


We should not confound speech with the natural movements which indicate the passions, and can be imitated by machines as well as manifested by animals; nor must it be thought with certain of the ancients, that the brutes speak, although we do not understand their language. 

For if such were the case, since they are endowed with many organs analogous to ours, they could as easily communicate their thoughts to us as to their fellows. 

There are many animals which are more hardworking than us in certain actions. 

The same animals are yet observed to show none at all in many others= so that the circumstance that they do better than we does not prove that they are endowed with mind, for it would thence follow that they possessed greater reason than any of us, and could surpass us in all things.

On the contrary, it rather proves that they are destitute of reason, and that it is nature which acts in them according to the disposition of their organs= thus it is seen, that a clock composed only of wheels and weights can number the hours and measure time more exactly than we with all our skin.

The reasonable soul:
- is not educed from the power of matter. Instead, the soul must be expressly created. 
- is not sufficient for it to be lodged in the human body exactly like a pilot in a ship, unless perhaps to move its members, but that it is necessary for it to be joined and united more closely to the body, in order to have sensations and appetites similar to ours, and thus constitute a real man.

The subject of the soul is of the greatest moment. 

Some people make the mistake of denying God's existence. 

There is an idea that the soul of brutes is of the same nature with our own. This idea leads feeble minds astray from the straight path of virtue the most. 

This makes them think that there is nothing after this life just like flies and ants have nothing to hope or fear for. 

Instead, we should think that the reason of animals are different. The soul is wholly independent of the body. It cannot die with the body. Therefore, it is immortal because nothing can destroy it.
