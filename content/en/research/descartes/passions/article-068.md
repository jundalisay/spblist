### 68. Why this enumeration of Passions differs from the commonly accepted one.

Other people have written about the passions. But they base their list on what they distinguish in the sensitive part of the soul as two appetites, which they call one Concupiscible, the other Irascible.

But I do not recognize such a distinction which would mean that the soul has 2 faculties:

1. To desire
2. To anger

<!-- since it has in the same way the faculties to admire, to love, to hope, to fear, and thus to receive within itself each of the other passions, or to perform the actions to which these passions impel it,  -->

I do not understand why other philosophers wanted to relate all passions to concupiscence or anger. 

Moreover, their enumeration does not include all the principal passions which mine does. There are an indefinite number of passions.*

{{< n n="Yoga tradition numbers the passions as 1,000" >}}
 

  <!-- I speak only of the principal ones, because there could still be distinguished several others more specific, and their number is . -->


### 69. There are only 6 Primitive Passions

<!-- But the number of those that are simple and primitive is not very large. For in making a review of all those that I have enumerated, one can easily observe that there are  -->

These are:

1. Admiration
2. Love
3. Hatred
4. Desire
5. Joy
6. Sadness

All the others are composed of some of these six, or are their species. 

<!-- Therefore, to avoid confusing the readers with their multitude, I will treat separately here the six primitive passions, and afterwards I will show in what way all the others derive their origin from them. -->


### 70. Definition and Cause of Admiration

Admiration is a sudden surprise of the soul, which causes it to consider with attention objects that appear rare and extraordinary to it.

Thus admiration is caused firstly by the impression in the brain, which represents the object as rare and therefore worthy of careful consideration. 

Then subsequently by the movement of the spirits, which are disposed by this impression to tend with great force towards the part of the brain where it is located, to strengthen and maintain it there; just as they are disposed by it to pass from there into the muscles that serve to keep the organs of the senses in the same position they are, so that it may be further sustained by them, if it is formed by them.


### 71. There is no change in the heart or in the blood in Admiration

Admiration has the peculiarity that it is not noticed to be accompanied by any change that happens in the heart and in the blood, as the other passions.

This is because it does not have good or evil as its object, but only knowledge of the thing that is admired. 

And so, it has no connection with the heart and blood, from which all the good of the body depends. It only connects with the brain, where the organs of the senses that serve this knowledge are.


### 72. The force of Admiration is made up of what?

Admiration can have great strength due to surprise through the sudden and unexpected arrival of the impression that changes the movement of the spirits.

Surprise is proper and peculiar to Admiration. 

This is because surprise increases the movement of the spirits. 

<!-- passion: so that when it is met in others, as it is accustomed to meet in almost all, and to increase them, it is because admiration is joined with them.  -->

The strength of Admiration depends on 2 things:

1. Novelty

2. The initial movement

This is because the movement that it causes has all its strength from its beginning.

Such a movement has more effect than those which are weak at first then grow gradually and can easily be turned away.

New sensory perceptions touch the brain in certain parts which are not used to being touched.

These parts are softer, or less firm, than those which have been hardened by a frequent agitation.

This increases the effect of the movements which they excite there.

<!-- What will not be found incredible, if we consider that it is the same reason that makes  -->

This is the same reason why we do not often notice the large and rough touch from the soles of our feet carrying our body. 

<!-- are used to a fairly rough touch caused by the weight our body. 

This is why we feel only very little of this touch when we walk. -->

Whereas a much smaller and softer touch, such as tickling, is almost unbearable to us because it is not ordinary to us.


<!-- Which does not prevent it from having much strength, because of the surprise, that is to say, the sudden and unexpected arrival of the impression that changes the movement of the spirits; which surprise is proper and peculiar to this passion: so that when it occurs in others, as it commonly does in almost all, and increases them, it is because admiration is joined with them. And its strength depends on two things, namely novelty, and that the movement it causes has its full strength from the beginning. For it is certain that such a movement has more effect than those which, being weak at first, and growing only gradually, can easily be diverted. It is also certain that the objects of the senses which are new touch the brain in certain parts to which it is not accustomed to be touched, and that these parts, being softer or less firm than those which frequent agitation has hardened, increase the effect of the movements they excite there. This will not be found incredible, if one considers that it is a similar reason which causes that the soles of our feet, being accustomed to a rather rough touch by the weight of the body they bear, we hardly feel this touch when we walk; whereas another much smaller and softer touch, with which they are tickled, is almost unbearable to us, only because it is not usual. -->


### 73. What is Astonishment?

 <!-- cavities of the -->
This surprise has so much power to cause the spirits in the brain to go where the impression of the admired object is located.

Sometimes, this surprise pushes all the spirits there, and makes them so occupied in preserving this impression, that none of them pass from there into the muscles, nor even turn from the first traces they have followed in the brain.

This causes:
- the whole body to remain immobile like a statue
- one to only perceive of the admired object when it was first perceived and not consequently acquire a more particular knowledge of it

This is called astonishment. 

It is an excess of admiration, which can never be other than bad.


### 74. For what all passions are useful, and how they harm.

The usefulness of all the passions is only that they strengthen and preserve the good thoughts in the soul. Without such passions, those thoughts would have been easily erased. 

Their only harm is that they strengthen and preserve the thoughts more than is necessary. They preserve and strengthen those that should not be retained.
