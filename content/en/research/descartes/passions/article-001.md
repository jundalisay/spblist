<!-- ### Part One: On Passions In General, And Incidental To The Nature Of Man -->

### 1. What is Passion in relation to one subject is always Action in another respect.

<!-- Nothing better demonstrates the deficiencies of  -->

The deficiency of the sciences that we have inherited from the ancients is most obvious with what they have written about the Passions.

<!-- For although  and seems not among the most difficult to understand, since  -->

Everyone experiences the passions within themselves. This makes the knowledge about it always highly sought after.
 <!-- and thus needs no external observation to discover their nature,  -->

But what the ancients have taught us is so little and mostly so hard to believe. This is why I must deviate from the paths they followed.

<!-- approach the truth by   -->

<!-- Therefore, I will be obliged to write here as if treating a subject that no one before me had ever touched upon.   generally called by philosophers  -->

Everything that happens, or occurs anew, is:
- a Passion with regard to its subject
- an Action with regard to its actor

 <!-- the one who causes it to happen. -->

 <!-- to which it happens and an -->



The actor and the [feeler] are often very different.
- But Action and Passion remain always the same thing

<!-- , which has these two names by reason of the two different subjects to which it can be related. -->


### 2. We must distinguish the soul's functions from the body's functions in order to know the soul's Passions

Our body acts most against our soul, which is connected to it. 

<!-- I also consider that we do not notice any subject acting more immediately against our soul than the  to which it is joined. -->

Consequently, a Passion in the soul is commonly an Action in the body. 

Therefore, we can best understand our Passions by examining the difference between the soul and the body.

This will let us know to which of the two is the cause of the functions in us.


### 3. What rule should be followed for this purpose

<!-- There will be no great difficulty in this if we notice that  -->

Everything we experience in ourselves that we experience also in inanimate bodies must be attributed only to our body.

Conversely, everything in us which we cannot conceive as belonging to a body must be attributed to our soul.


### 4. Heat and the movement of the limbs come from the body. Thoughts come from the soul

<!-- Thus, because we do not conceive that the body can think in any way, we have reason to believe that  -->

All types of thoughts in us belong to the soul.

A flame alone has much more heat and movement than any of our limbs.

There are inanimate bodies that:
- can move in as many or more diverse ways than ours,
- have as much or more heat than our bodies

All the heat and all the movements in us, insofar as they do not depend on thought, belong only to the body.


### 5. The soul does not give movement and heat to the body

<!-- In this way, we will avoid a considerable error into which many have fallen, to the extent that I believe it is the primary cause that has prevented a  and other things that belong to the soul up to now.  -->

<!-- It consists in seeing that all dead bodies are deprived of heat and consequently of movement.  -->

People think that:
- dead bodies are unable to move and generate heat because they lack the soul 
- our natural heat and all the movements of our bodies depend on the soul

<!-- it the absence of the soul in  causes the movements and the heat of the body to cease.  -->

<!-- This is because they have unreasonably believed that  -->

This wrong idea is why there has been no good explanation of the Passions up to now.

Instead, they should have thought the opposite, that the soul only departs when one dies because:
- this heat ceases and
- the organs that move the body become corrupted.


### 6. What is the difference between a living body and a dead body

<!-- To avoid this error, consider that  -->

Death never occurs due to the fault of the soul, but only because some of the principal parts of the body become corrupted.

The body of a living man differs as much from that of a dead man as a working clock is different from a broken one that ceases to act. 

 <!-- or other automaton (that is to say, another machine that moves by itself) differs when it is wound up and has in itself the corporeal principle of the movements for which it is designed, along with everything required for its action,  -->

<!-- and the same clock or other machine when it is broken and the principle of its movement . -->
