### 170. Indecision

Indecision is another form of Fear that holds the soul in balance between several actions it could undertake.

This causing the soul to execute none. This provides time to choose before deciding.

This has some good use. But it becomes harmful when prolonged, consuming time needed for action.

It stems from Fear, but indecision may also arise without Fear, when choices seem equally good. Such indecision is not a passion unless Fear of making the wrong choice intensifies uncertainty.

In some, this Fear is so strong that it paralyzes them, even when faced with a single option. 

Excessive indecision arises from an excessive desire to act correctly and a lack of clear understanding, which can be remedied by cultivating decisive judgments and believing that doing what seems best fulfills one’s duty, even if the judgment is faulty.



### 171. Courage and Boldness

Courage, when it is a passion rather than a natural inclination, is a warmth or agitation that drives the soul powerfully toward executing its will, regardless of the nature of the task.

Boldness is a form of Courage specifically aimed at executing dangerous tasks.


### 172. Emulation
  
Emulation is another form of Courage but in a different sense.

Courage can be considered a category that divides into species based on differing objects or causes. Boldness is one species regarding objects, and Emulation is another regarding causes.

Emulation is a warmth that motivates the soul to attempt tasks it hopes to succeed in because it sees others succeed in them.

Thus, it is a type of Courage whose external cause is example, while the internal cause is the body’s disposition, where Desire and Hope drive more blood to the heart than Fear or Despair can impede.


### 173. How Boldness Relates to Hope

Boldness targets difficulty, often accompanied by Fear or even Despair. 

But it is most employed in dangerous or desperate situations.

However, one must still hope—or even be assured—that the intended outcome will succeed to confront difficulties with vigor. The end goal differs from the object of boldness.

ne cannot be assured and despair of the same thing simultaneously. 

For instance, Roman Decii rushing into enemy lines embraced certain death, despairing of their survival yet hoping to inspire their soldiers to victory or secure posthumous glory.
