### 17. The Functions of the Soul

The soul has 2 functions:

1. Actions

These are all our wills. Our will comes directly from our soul and seem to depend only on it.

2. Passions

<!-- After considering all the functions that belong only to the body, it is easy to understand that nothing remains in us that we should attribute to our soul, except our thoughts, which are mainly of two kinds: namely, some are actions of the soul, others are its passions.  -->

These are all the kinds of perceptions or knowledge that are found in us. Often, it is not our soul that makes them as they are, and it always receives them from the things that are represented by them.


### 18. The Will

Our wills are of 2 kinds:

1. Some are actions of the soul that end in the soul itself, such as when we want to love God or generally apply our thought to some object that is not material

2. Others are actions that end in our body, such as when, from the mere fact that we have the will to walk, it follows that our legs move and we walk.



### 19. Perception

Our perceptions are also of 2 kinds:

1. Those that are caused by the soul

These are the perceptions of our wills, and of all imaginations or other thoughts that depend on them. This is because we cannot will anything without perceiving at the same time that we will it.

This will comes from our passions. 

2. Those that are caused by the body


<!-- Although with regard to our soul, it is an action to will something, we can say that it is also in it a passion to perceive that it wills. 

However, this perception and this will are the same thing. 

, the denomination is always made by what is the most noble; and thus it is not customary to call it a passion, but only an action.

And although in respect of our soul it is an Action to will something, it can also be said in it to be a Passion to perceive that it wills. 

However, because this perception and this volition are really the same thing, the name is always taken from the more noble one; and so it is not usually called a Passion, but only an Action. -->


### 20. The Imaginations and Other Thoughts Formed by the Soul


Our soul sometimes imagines something that does not exist, an enchanted palace or a chimera.
- This uses the will to perceive it. 

<!-- is not, such as to represent ; and also when it applies itself to consider something that is only intelligible and not imaginable, for example, to consider its own nature, the perceptions it has of these things depend mainly on the will that makes it perceive them.  -->

Therefore, they are usually considered actions rather than passions.


### 21. The Imaginations That Have Only the Body for Their Cause

Most bodily perceptions depend on the nerves.
- Some depend on the memory. 

<!-- Among the  caused by the body, most   -->

Examples of bodily perceptions that come from the memory are imaginations.
- These are not part of the actions of the soul.

<!-- But there are also some that do not depend on them. These are called imaginations, like those I have just spoken of, which nevertheless differ in that our will does not apply itself to form them; which means that they cannot be counted among the actions of the soul.  -->

These imaginations happen only because the animal spirits can be agitated by encountering the traces of impressions in the brain.
- This makes them flow through certain pores. 

Examples are the illusions of our dreams at night or during the day. 

 <!-- and also the daydreams we often have when awake, when our thought wanders listlessly, without applying itself to anything in particular. -->

Some of these imaginations are passions of the soul.

<!-- taking this word in its most proper and particular meaning; and although they can all be thus named if we take it in a more general meaning: 

nevertheless, because they do not have such a notable and determined cause as the perceptions the soul receives through the nerves, and because they seem to be only the shadow and painting of them, before we can distinguish them well, we must consider the difference that exists between these others. -->
