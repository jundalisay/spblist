### 51. What are the first causes of the passions?

<!-- The last and most immediate cause of  is nothing other than  -->

The agitation by which the spirits move the pineal gland is the cause of the passions. 

But this alone is not sufficient to distinguish them from each other. 

It is necessary to investigate their sources and examine their first causes. 

Sometimes, the passions may be caused by:
- the action of the soul, which determines to conceive certain objects
- the temperament of the body alone
- the impressions that happen fortuitously in the brain
  - This is when we feel sad or joyful without finding any reason for it.*


{{< n n="In Superphysics, this is caused by the influence of the stars and galaxies. This is because stars and galaxies are spactime vortices, which is of the same layer or element as the animals spirits. Since there is no Void, then those vortices cause disturbances in the spatial layer which then carries over to the animal spirits. This makes us tend towards different emotions depending on the disposition of that layer since these are instinctive and do not require the oversight of the soul." >}}
  

Yet these same passions can also be excited by objects that affect the senses. These objects are their more ordinary and principal causes. 

Hence it follows that to identify all of them, it suffices to consider all the effects of these objects.


### 52. What is their use? How can they be enumerated?

The objects which affect the senses incite various passions in us due to:
- the various ways in which those objects can harm or benefit us
- their importance to use in general

<!--  all the diversities that exist in them, but only due to 

, or simply be important . -->

The purpose of all passions is to dispose the soul:
- to desire the things that nature dictates to be useful to us, and
- to persist in this desire

<!-- just as the same agitation of the spirits, which usually causes them, disposes the body to the movements that serve the execution of these things.  -->

<!-- Therefore, to enumerate them, it is sufficient to systematically examine in how many -->


I will list all the principal passions in the order in which they can be found.

These are the main ways our senses can be moved by their objects.
