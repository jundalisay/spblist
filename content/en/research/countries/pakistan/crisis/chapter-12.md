Pakistan's energy sector is in crisis. Its problems seem
insurmountable. Although positive initiatives have been implemented over
the years many opportunities have been lost. The result is the current
predicament.

Power outages of up to eighteen hours a day disrupt the lives of
people and threaten the economy in an unprecedented way. Despite
abundant installed capacity the power system is mired in critical
operational issues including a pervasive circular debt. Payment arrears
between various entities has jammed the flow of funds through the power
supply-chain, and deprived fuel suppliers and independent power
producers of cash to the extent that their viability and therefore output is
jeopardised. Demand is outstripping supply at a time when the country's
security situation imposes obvious constraints. But if the energy deficit is
not urgently tackled it contains the seeds of dangerous social unrest.
Equally disquieting is the fact that energy policy initiatives being
promoted today are the same as those proposed some thirty years ago,
indicating little implementation progress in the intervening years while the
crisis deepened.

How can this situation be remedied? In light of overwhelming
evidence that the absence of a coordinated energy policy remains a
fundamental constraint, an integrated approach needs to be established
together with an institutional structure that supports it. This was partially
implemented in Pakistan in the 1980s but faded away subsequently with
the increasing fragmentation of policy institutions and functions. Without
integration, decision-making remains inherently flawed and policy
initiatives are reduced to shooting in the dark.

244The country has the capacity to speedily revive the integrated
approach together with the first steps of a supporting institutional
structure. The rest of the institutional changes can be phased in gradually.
This will enable policy-makers to rapidly tackle, on an informed basis, the
urgent and longer-term problems facing the sector, replacing the current
ad hoc approach which reacts to, rather than averts, crises. It will help pave
the way for the recovery of the energy sector that can then aid the
economic rebound. It is not so much the availability of resources but how
they are managed which makes the difference between success and
failure.


### State of the Energy Sector

Pakistan's policy-makers have done a reasonably good job of
articulating (repeatedly through several five-year planning cycles) policy
objectives for the energy sector.' The broad objective is to develop the sector
to support an expanding economy. Developing indigenous resources,
importing energy at competitive prices to meet deficits, expanding delivery
infrastructure and improving energy efficiency and reliability, would enhance
energy supplies. Security of energy supply would be increased by greater
reliance on national resources thus reducing import dependence, and by
diversification of energy supplies to manage risks and external shocks. Long-
term viability of the sector would be supported by a shift in the role of
government from owner to that of policy-maker and regulator, encouraging
the private sector to own and run the energy companies through appropriate
incentives, including attracting foreign and local private capital and
deploying competitive processes. Also, the objectives contain consumer-
oriented, eco-friendly and pro-poor elements, promoting service-provision,
environmental protection and affordable energy for the underprivileged.
Despite these laudable objectives the sector is in a dire state. The
problem is not a lack of clarity on what needs to be done but how it is to be
done.

Before considering solutions, it is essential to briefly review the state
of the sector, the gravity of issues, and why the situation has become so
serious. The official Pakistan Energy Yearbook 2009 lays out the supply and
consumption picture. Total primary energy supply in Pakistan is 63 MTOE
(Million Tons of Oil Equivalence) of which natural gas accounts for 48 per
cent, oil 32 per cent, hydroelectricity 11 per cent and coal around 7 per
245cent. Nuclea1 LPG and imported electricity make up the remaining 2 per
cent. Pakistan imports a third of its energy requirements mainly in the form
of oil and coal, despite huge proven reserves of coal and a significant
exploration potential of oil. Over 80 per cent (17 MTOE) of Pakistan's oil
requirements are imported at a prohibitive cost of $12 billion a year, and
over 60 per cent (3 MTOE) of its coal supplies come from overseas.
The official figure for total energy consumption is 37 MTOE, the
difference between supply and consumption being the losses in conversion,
processing, transmission, distribution, as well as non-technical losses,
which is a euphemism for theft. The industrial sector is the dominant
consumer with over 40 per cent of the market. The transport sector
consumes just over 30 per cent and households around 22 per cent. The
remainder consists mainly of commercial and agricultural consumers.
The Hydrocarbon Development Institute of Pakistan (HDIP) in the
Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources produces an impressive
document, the Energy Yearbook, based on input from various energy­
related ministries and agencies. The quality of information and analysis is
testament to the fact that, despite the serious brain drain from Pakistan,
islands of excellence remain. This offers hope for the future and gives
pause to those who maintain that the situation is beyond redemption.
There is, however, a glaring omission, which reflects the
preoccupation of policy-makers. The data pertains only to commercial
energy, i.e., energy for consumers connected to national grids and billed
for services.

Estimates of non-commercial or traditional forms of energy are
missing. Data in this area is sporadic and much less reliable, mainly
because of the conspicuous lack of attention accorded to it. If non-
commercial energy is included, the supply picture changes dramatically.
Traditional biofuels (fuelwood and other biomass) head the list, followed,
in descending order, by natural gas, oil, hydro and coal. On the consumption
end, again, a starkly different picture emerges. Households become the
primary consumer using 50 per cent of the mix. Biofuels account for over
85 per cent of household energy use, of which fuelwood is the largest
component followed by biomass, and crop residues.

The most egregious aspect of the omission is that non-commercial
energy use accounts for nearly half of the overall demand for energy in
Pakistan. By including non-commercial energy in the calculations, policy-
246makers will be forced to consider major shifts in emphasis. Supply and
consumption patterns are presented in Table 1 below.

247In one sense, the historical neglect of non-commercial energy seems
understandable. Commercial energy is a key ingredient for national growth
and prima facie warrants the lion's share of attention, particularly if growth
has been stymied, as has often been the case in Pakistan, and there is pressure
on policy-makers to jump-start the economy. There is an inherent fallacy in
this approach. While commercial energy consumers contribute significantly
to GDP growth, neglected non-commercial consumers drag down national
output over the longer­ term by unregulated and unchecked practices and
technologies, which waste energy and denude forestry resources by
harvesting beyond the maximum allowable cut, i.e. beyond the level at
which the forestry resource becomes unsustainable. Although the economic,
social and environmental implications of the neglect requires a separate
detailed study, we only need to look around us to see the disastrous effects on
the degradation of forests and eco-systems, and the poverty that this approach
has engendered over the past sixty-four years.

In evaluating the state of the sector in relation to the economy, three
other parameters are significant. First, data from the Energy Yearbook and the
Economic Survey clearly show that growth in energy consumption and
economic growth have followed almost identical patterns for the last decade
and a half, reaffirming that energy fuels the economy and its shortage curbs
growth. The second is Pakistan's per capita energy consumption, which at 0.49
TOE is significantly lower than the world average of 1.78. This reflects the
country's level of development. As energy availability is a key determinant in
the standard of living, this parameter is also indicative of the high incidence
of poverty. The third is Pakistan's energy consumption per dollar of GDP
growth, which is around 0.82 against the world average of 0.32. This illustrates
the relative inefficiency of energy use in Pakistan and highlights the pressing
need to strengthen policy initiatives that encourage greater utilisation
efficiency. In a constrained energy supply situation, any improvement in
efficiency means adding to the supply.

The above figures are based on commercial energy but if non-
commercial energy is included, the comparisons are likely to be even more
pronounced. Moreover, the household sector, which is the largest consumer
and where waste is greatest, would become the focus of improving energy
efficiency. By excluding non-commercial energy, the industrial sector
appears as the largest consumer and therefore the focus of attention. This does
not imply that the industrial sector should be overlooked. There are many
low-cost and no-cost initiatives that can be implemented here. But it is
248important to strike the right balance between available financial resources
and the concentration of effort.

Pakistan's energy resource potential is substantial and remains
largely unharnessed although not all of it is currently financially or
technically exploitable. This potential is in the form of depleting fossil
fuels (oil, gas, coal) as well as renewables (hydro, solar, wind, wood fuels
and agricultural residues). Among fossil fuels, in the petroleum (oil and
gas) sub-sector, Pakistan has a large prospective area (or, in geological
language, sedimentary basin) covering 830,000 square kilometres.
Probable reserves are estimated at twenty-seven billion barrels of oil and
282 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of gas.

Of this, 936 million barrels of oil had been confirmed and 609 million
barrels produced till 2007, leaving 327 million barrels of proven reserves yet
to be recovered. The reserves-to-production ratio stands at fourteen,
critically low considering the high and growing level of oil imports, and
compared with the worldwide ratio of forty. For natural gas, 53 TCF have
been confirmed, of which 23 TCF were produced till 2007, leaving 30 TCF
of proven reserves. The reserves-to-production ratio is twenty-one—
uncomfortably low given Pakistan's heavy dependence on natural gas as
the primary commercial fuel, and in comparison with a worldwide ratio of
59.

Till early 2009, 725 exploratory wells had been drilled which
resulted in over 219 oil and gas discoveries. This works out to a drilling
density of 1.99 wells per 1,000 square kilometres—far lower than the
world average of ten. However, the success rate of 1:3.3 is much better
than the world average of 1:10. The success rate coupled with the large
sedimentary basin implies that if the exploration level is increased, there
are good chances of significantly raising the level of proven reserves and,
consequently, production of oil and gas. This, however, is proving
difficult since vast portions of the sedimentary basin lie in areas where
security deters any significant exploration—more so as such activity is
usually carried out by international oil companies with their own
manpower and risk capital.

Pakistan's indigenous coal reserves are huge, estimated at 186 billion
tons, of which the Thar deposit of 175 billion tons is the fifth largest in
the world. Proven reserves stand at 1,980 million tons and at the present
249production level the reserves-to-production ratio is well over 400. This
signals the need to enhance production significantly. However, most of this
coal is of low quality (high sulphur and ash content) and is located in
remote areas. Its exploitation therefore requires expensive excavation,
treatment and transport infrastructure, in areas where security is a concern.
Renewable energy sources are also significant. Hydroelectric
potential in Pakistan is an impressive 41,700 MW of which only 6,600
MW or 16 per cent has been harnessed till today. For mini-hydro (units up
to 5 MW capacity), the potential is about 1500 MW of which only 60 MW
(4 per cent) has been tapped. Pakistan's almost entirely untapped wind
energy potential, according to the USAID Renewable Energy Lab, is
estimated at 41,000 MW of power generation based on areas of favourable
wind regimes.

Solar energy is abundant and remains unharnessed except for a few
isolated projects. If only 0.25 per cent of the land area of the province of
Balochistan were covered by solar panels of 20 per cent efficiency, this
would be enough to provide electricity to the entire country. However, the
feasibility of generating large quantities of wind and solar power (while
improving with continuing research) is highly questionable. Estimates for
non-commercial sources, mainly wood fuels, are less reliable. These
resources are considerable and constitute 45 per cent of the energy supply
mix for the country. However, there is ample evidence that in several parts
of the country, unregulated harvesting of this poorly managed resource is
severely impairing its sustainability.

The current state of the energy deficit and its projected growth is
even more worrisome for the future. Data from the Planning Commission,
although ignoring non-commercial energy, illustrates the magnitude of the
crisis ahead. It projects an annual energy demand increasing from the
present level of around 60 MTOE to 198 MTOE by the year 2025. This is
based on an annual economic growth of 6.5 per cent. While not consistent
with recent trends, this could be envisioned over the longer term, with an
abating global financial crisis and a cautiously optimistic view of
Pakistan's economic regeneration.

The total indigenous supply over the same period increases from
around 40 MTOE to only 75 MTOE. Oil and gas supplies are assumed to
increase only slightly in line with constraints on future exploration
250activities. In contrast, indigenous energy from coal, hydroelectricity,
nuclear and non-traditional renewable sources, are assumed to increase
significantly in an attempt to offset limitations in oil and gas. The resulting
deficit grows from the already disquieting level of around 20 MTOE to a
staggering 122 MTOE by 2025. These figures, perhaps more than any
other, underscore the fragility of the energy sector, implying a long-term
dependence on external sources. This is neither a viable nor affordable
scenario.

Three characteristics of Pakistan's energy sector take on special
significance. First, the indigenous resource potential is substantial, not-
withstanding some critical exploitation issues. Two, the energy deficit is
prohibitively large and expanding. Three, nearly half the population,
mainly the rural poor, is not connected to the commercial grids and relies
on non-commercial energy. This combination often tempts policymakers to
promote the harnessing of all forms of energy available. This is a common
trap, particularly in a severely cash-strapped environment such as
Pakistan. In this approach, for example, undue priority is given to
renewable forms such as solar and wind, since they are considered free and
able to reach poor, remote localities. Such forms of energy are indeed 'free'
since they are constantly renewable, but they are not necessarily cheap.
Moreover, they do little to close large deficits. Even compared with
nuclear power generation, itself an expensive option, wind power is
around 60 percent more expensive and solar about 30 per cent.
Nevertheless, to support poverty alleviation objectives under severe
budgetary constraints, all options should be on the table but a mechanism
needs to be in place to strike an affordable balance. The degree of
departure from the optimum can make the difference between success and
failure of energy policy.

How did we get here? How this dire state of affairs came about is
analysed in a noteworthy work, which traces the history of the downward
spiral and milestones along the way. The path is characterised by 'stop-go'
reforms, policy reversals, bureaucratic delays and missed opportunities
and, over the last decade or so, a growing security crisis. Through all this,
there were some sound and well-intentioned policy initiatives and
concerted efforts towards implementation. However, these efforts could
not yield the desired results in a policy environment, which lacked the
necessary fundamentals.

251A few examples illustrate the dilemma. In the early 1980s, there
were four international oil companies, which had been granted concessions
for exploration in Pakistan. Such companies commonly deploy their own
capital for exploration, relying on satisfactory profit sharing or
production-sharing agreements with the government to recoup their
expenditures once commercial production begins. Drilling conditions
were difficult and expensive with deep wells in high-pressure areas but
discovery prospects were good. However, a major oil company, on the verge
of a significant discovery, decided to suspend drilling operations and leave the
country. The net effect was to discourage further exploration at a time when
at least ten companies were considering the possibility of exploring in
Pakistan with their own capital for the first time—a possibility that could have
turned around the country's energy future.

A combination of factors led to the oil company's departure. Among
them was the inflexibility of the bureaucracy to address glaring anomalies in
the tax structure, which severely eroded the cash flow of the company
especially in areas with high exploration costs. The second, more significant
reason was that, under the prevailing policy regime, oil and gas prices could
only be negotiated after commercial discovery. This was a major disincentive
for a company deploying its own capital in expensive operations. Rising
expenditures in an uncertain post-discovery regime was enough to warrant a
pull-out even on the verge of discovery, to the detriment of Pakistan's
economy. Pakistan's policy­makers failed to understand that the country was
competing with others across the world in attracting scarce exploration risk
capital. For this, it needed to make its pricing regime as attractive as possible. If
there had been a mechanism to rapidly assess the economic penalty of the policy,
which traded immense long-term benefits for short-lived financial gains, the story
would have been different. It is a credit to subsequent policy-makers that these
retrogressive policies were amended. This is now reflected in the government's
exploration promotion and investment promotion documents. However by the
time this was done conditions had changed. The security situation became a key
deterrent to exploration. This underscores a lost opportunity, one of many policy
actions offering too little, too late.

At around the same time, another petroleum company involved in a joint
venture with the government had decided to sell to the government its shares
in a natural gas field development operation, which provided valuable
nitrogen-rich gas feedstock to the fertilizer industry. It took over a year to
negotiate the sale price and government inter­locutors were able to reduce the
252purchase price by a significant amount. This could be considered a major gain
but for one serious repercussion. Through the protracted negotiations, the field
expansion program was put on hold, resulting in immense losses in revenue to
the joint venture itself, as well as to the fertilizer industry, and in terms of
lost agricultural productivity due to lack of fertilizer. Again, a mechanism
to assess the penalty could well have prompted speedier negotiations with
less immediate financial gains but with vastly greater financial and
economic benefits in the longer term.

Perhaps the most significant example of lost opportunities relates to
Central Asia in the early to mid-90s when all six of the newly independent
republics, under immense internal economic pressures, were actively
seeking avenues to export their surplus energy. Strong consideration was
given to the southern corridor through Pakistan to tap the large energy-
starved South Asian market as well as gain access to ports on the Arabian
Sea for further extending export. This was well before the security
situation in Afghanistan had begun to deteriorate. As expected, there were
competitors promoting alternative routes. The Great Game was on again,
being played with higher stakes and at electronic speed.

Central Asian authorities and international consortia made several
attempts to pursue discussions with Pakistani authorities but progress was
elusive. One thing was evident. The level of interest and effort of the
competitors drowned out the lukewarm response of the Pakistani
government and private sector. The rest is history. 

One can only surmise
how the trade corridors, had they been established, would have
transformed the regional scenario. Revenue from trade and from
transporting energy across the region would have brought immense
benefits to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Both countries, as well as India,
would have also benefited from greatly enhanced energy supplies. The
resulting prosperity and trade links would certainly have strengthened
interdependence among the three countries and helped mitigate the
conflict which currently engulfs the region.

### Integrated Energy Planning

Energy analysts and policy-makers alike agree that energy sector planning and policy formulation need to be carried out on an integrated basis. The appropriate mechanism to achieve this is known by various acronyms.

This chapter refers to it as IEP (Integrated Energy Planning). The concept and principles of IEP presented here are those advocated in Integrated National Energy Planning in Developing Countries', amended to reflect conditions in Pakistan. In practice, as is the case in Pakistan, investment planning and pricing are often carried out on an ad hoc, crisis-driven, sub-sector basis. Typically, as also happens in Pakistan, electricity and oil sub-sector plans are prepared largely independent of each other, as well as of other energy sub-sectors. Moreover, the powerful electric power sub-sector often dominates policy decisions on pricing, subsidies and investment priorities, which are inevitably skewed in its favour to the detriment of other sub-sectors, and the economy as a whole. In times of cheap energy, the repercussions could be relatively benign. However, with rising and volatile international oil prices and acute energy shortages, as is the case today, IEP
becomes vital.

IEP, as an integral part of economic planning, enables optimum use of
energy resources to achieve socio-economic development. Since energy
affects every part of the economy, the energy sector is analogous to the
financial sector. Some analysts describe energy as the physical counterpart of
money. IEP develops a coherent set of policies covering: energy needs to
meet growth and environmental targets; optimum fuels mix; conservation;
energy security through diversification and reducing dependence on external
sources; energy needs of the poor; foreign exchange savings; trade deficit
management and revenue generation to finance sector development. IEP
integrates the policies and plans of the energy sector with national economic
objectives, while ensuring close coordination and consistency between each
of the energy sub-sectors.

IEP is a five-stage process (Figure 1):

1. Establishing the socio-economic background and national objectives
2. Analysing energy demand
3. Identifying supply options
4. Constructing the energy balance
5. Formulating policy and analysing its impact. 

The energy balance, the core of IEP, assigns specific energy sources to corresponding uses. It stipulates
the supply of various forms of energy, its conversion and losses and the net
available for consumption, broken down by sector. IEP yields a set of
detailed energy policies and plans (including policy tools and investment)
for the short, medium, and long term, under various scenarios, tested for
impact on the economy. The success of IEP depends upon establishing a
separate ministry or department for energy with over­arching
responsibility for the sector and access to top policy levels. As an interim
measure, an integrated energy cell can be set up in a central agency such
as a planning ministry.

'Integration' under IEP does not signify the revival of central
planning or building a more intrusive or manifold bureaucracy. On the
contrary, the mechanism is designed to facilitate coordination, and the
concomitant institutional structure streamlines and considerably reduces
bureaucracy and red tape. This can become contentious because of the
reluctance of concerned ministries, agencies and individuals to accept
realignment of the power structure that must accompany such changes—
hence the importance of political will.


### International Experience

The concept of IEP was introduced in the 1970s and successfully
applied in a wide range of countries, amended to suit individual country
conditions. However, in the 1990s, in the wake of a major push by
international development agencies to promote market economies in the
developing world, it began to wane on the assumption that the free market
will determine appropriate policy choices. This assumption does not hold
for most countries in the developing world. It might have been
ideologically motivated to counter the 'Gosplan' heritage of the newly
independent states of the former Soviet Union. Fast-forward to today. The
World Bank is preparing a global energy sector strategy. Feedback from
countries has identified the absence of long-term energy planning as an
emerging issue—signalling the importance of reverting to coordinated
long-term planning for those countries that may have discarded the model
and suffered as a consequence. Common sense seems to be prevailing over
ideology to achieve a practical balance.

Through all this, most developing countries maintained some form of
integrated energy planning. Success was characterised by three ingredients:
comprehensive coordinated analysis; supporting institutional arrangements at
the policy level, and sound implementation. Analytical sophistication varied,
but institutional structures have evolved into a central energy policy
institution, configured in one of two ways: a stand-alone integrated energy
ministry or an integrated energy department/agency within a central ministry. A
few examples of countries which fall into one or other of the two arrangements
(both supportive of IEP) include: Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines,
Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Cambodia,
Viet Nam, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Turkey, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan,
Uzbekistan, Uganda, and Kazakhstan.
Two countries with well-managed energy sectors, which can serve as
examples for Pakistan are Turkey and Kazakhstan, in terms of an integrated
line ministry model and well-coordinated and successfully implemented
policies.

IEP in Pakistan

Many analysts have drawn attention to the lack of energy policy
coordination. 'The Weight of History: Pakistan's Energy Problem' which
focuses on commercial energy, emphasises the need for a comprehensive
approach. On traditional fuels, 'Energy, Poverty Reduction and Equitable
Development in Pakistan' states: 'it is imperative that government policies and
strategies recognize' the 'near invisibility of the role of traditional fuels', for
which it advocates 'better inter-sectoral policy coordination, and integrated
development approaches' maintaining that 'the costs of inaction are high.'
The absence of comprehensive integrated energy planning has also
evoked international comment. Quoting an executive, the New York Times
wrote: 'There is nobody in Islamabad who is working on a coherent, integrated
plan. The discussion just keeps going in circles.' USAID's energy assessment
of Pakistan listed, as the first item, the following shortcoming: 'The ability to
perform system-wide planning in the electricity and energy sector as a whole,
both in terms of technical analysis and ability to develop and implement plans
of action.'

Building capacity requires coordinated interventions at three levels:
training at the individual level; building appropriate institutions to
effectively utilise trained manpower; and establishing a policy environment
which provides incentives for institutions to function efficiently. In the
energy sector Pakistan has relatively good access to training both within the
256country and overseas. Despite the gradual erosion of trained manpower, the
sector retains a modicum of quality. Weaknesses in the policy environment
have been discussed. What warrants a closer look is the organisational
structure of policy institutions especially the lead ministries, main regulatory
bodies and planning institutions in the energy sector. The Ministry of
Petroleum and Natural Resources heads the oil, gas and coal sub-sectors. The
Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority regulates petroleum product distribution
including CNG for vehicles, sets safety standards and equalises prices across
the country. Coal exploration and development are undertaken by the Pakistan
Mineral Development Corporation through leases granted to the private
sector, administered by provincial governments. The Ministry for Water and
Power is responsible for the electric power sub-sector. The Pakistan Atomic
Energy Commission oversees nuclear power generation. The National
Electric Power Regulatory Authority is charged with ensuring fair
competition and consumer protection. The Private Power and Infrastructure
Board was set up to improve investment incentives in the power sector as a
one-stop facility for investors.

The Ministry of Urban Affairs, Forestry and Wildlife oversees the
wood fuels sub-sector. The Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock
handles other biomass including agricultural residues. The Alternative Energy
Development Board is the central national body for renewable energy and is
also charged with rural electrification in areas remote from the power grid.
The SAARC Energy Center is being set up to address regional issues, to
facilitate energy trade within SAARC and promote more efficient energy use
within the region. The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Affairs is
involved in energy pricing and taxation policies. The Ministry of Production
and the Ministry of Industries deal with industrial energy conservation in the
public and private sector, respectively.

Thus, responsibility for the energy sector is highly fragmented and
there are major overlaps. This is clearly not conducive for IEP, despite the best
efforts of HDIP to compile and analyse data or of the Planning Commission
to coordinate plans emerging from so many institutions. IEP is not unknown
in Pakistan. To trace its history, it is necessary to turn the clock back to the
early 1980s when it was introduced, albeit partially and briefly. The
government of the time was firmly committed to establishing IEP and, as an
interim step, had established a planning unit within the Directorate General
of Energy Resources (DGER) in the Ministry of Petroleum. Recognising
that this location strengthened the dominance of the petroleum sub-sector
over other vital areas such as non-commercial energy, a decision was
257taken to move the expertise to a central neutral location. The ENERPLAN
Cell was created in the Planning Division and charged with the national
energy planning function. Relevant government administrative orders
were issued and budgets approved. Funding was secured for training and
technical assistance to start the analytical work. An Energy Policy Board,
with top-level representation from all energy-related ministries, was
instituted to provide 'a central coordination forum for policy decisions,
program guidelines, monitoring and evaluation of all components of
ENERPLAN'. Integration with national plans was to be carried out at this
level. Decisions having nation-wide impact were to be referred to the
National Economic Council or the Cabinet.

This was a good start. However, the risk was that the location in the
Planning Division would eventually dilute the importance of the energy
sector, given the Planning Division's involvement with the whole
economy. These arrangements were intended as interim measures till a
ministry of energy emerged. For a while the arrangements worked but then
began to falter. International institutions such as the World Bank
continued to provide loans and advice to the energy sector but policy
reform had slowed down. Emphasis on IEP was lost perhaps because of
the misplaced notion that market forces would compensate. It is
significant that the World Bank's last comprehensive energy sector review
for Pakistan dates to the early 1980s, despite the recognition that energy
is a critical impediment to economic development. Even the last sub-
sector (oil and gas) review dates to 2003. USAID did issue an energy
sector assessment in 2007, identifying the absence of integrated planning
as a primary weakness. However, it did not elaborate on what steps needed
to be taken.

The unravelling of IEP was inevitable since there was no
follow through on the necessary organisational changes. Instead of
moving towards a simple integrated structure, there was a gradual
expansion of the network of policy institutions, compounding the
complexity and confusion. So the situation in the energy sector today
should come as no surprise. Under these conditions, the ineffectiveness of
seemingly well-conceived and well-intentioned policy initiatives was
inevitable.

IEP now needs to be re-introduced, this time in a comprehensive
manner, supported by an appropriate institutional framework. The seeds
of IEP remain in Pakistan and can be revived quite rapidly to restart the
258process. Documents establishing the various bodies are in the records,
together with elaborate administrative and technical studies to back them
up. Moreover, many of the processes and skills already exist, such as
sophisticated national planning and budget processes and the know-how
for preparing energy balances. The expertise in HDIP can be transferred
to an energy planning cell in the Planning Division, strengthened by
expertise from the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock and the Alternative Energy Development Board, to give due
importance to non-commercial and other renewable forms.

The necessary institutional restructuring can take place on a phased
basis to minimise disruption. The first phase of restructuring, the
establishment of a planning cell with access to top policy levels, can be
done very rapidly. At the same time, plans would need to be initiated
towards forming the ministry of energy with the planning cell at its core,
and amending the structure, functions and decision-making processes of the
current energy-related policy bodies to facilitate the initiative. While
maintaining the independence of regulatory institutions, they should be put
under one roof to facilitate coordination. To minimise disruption, these
changes would need to be carefully designed and phased in. A firm
commitment towards this end, cemented with an up-front public
announcement, is vital. The cost of not doing so could, once again, result
in an un-raveling of the process and history will repeat itself.

IEP is not the panacea for Pakistan's energy problems. It is the
essential starting point without which informed policy decisions in this
sector cannot be made. It provides the ingredients of good data,
information and analysis, eliminating guesswork and lobbying by special
interests, which have tended to dominate the scene. Pakistan can finally
begin to optimise the sustainable exploitation and utilisation of energy
within its financial constraints and economic aspirations, addressing
overwhelming issues such as prohibitive and ever-widening energy
deficits.

How IEP Can Address Pakistan's Special Issues

Several issues in Pakistan's energy sector, similar to those found in
other parts of the developing world have been discussed earlier. IEP
provides an analytical platform to address these and to test out the
efficacy of a range of policy options. Some other special issues are dealt with
259below.

### Circular Debt

The government-owned electric power system pays for its expenses from sales revenues collected from consumers and the government makes up any deficit. The latter practice runs counter to
the declared objective of moving towards profitable operations and
eventual privatisation of entities in the sector.

Consumer tariffs are insufficient to pay for expenses and the government coffers are
overstretched. This results in prohibitive levels of arrears, including non-
payments to suppliers of fuel as well as to private independent power
producers (IPPs).

It also gives rise to a chain of outstanding arrears through the generation, transmission and distribution entities within the power system itself. While tariff increases and injection of government capital might be the quickest short-term remedy, these are only stop-gap
measures. 

Notwithstanding recent price adjustments, tariff levels have not increased sufficiently to cope with spikes in petroleum prices or low rainfall, which depresses hydel generation. Tariff increases are,
understandably, hampered by affordability issues.

The other side of the equation is the cost of power delivery. Here a
host of issues appea1; involving system management and structure,
maintenance levels, load balancing, plant utilisation and efficiency,
system losses including an inordinate level of theft, tariff collection
performance and related corruption, lack of regional interconnections, and
so on. System losses are a prohibitive 25 per cent of net generation and
consumer payment arrears are an unacceptable 30 per cent of the amount
billed.

In short, the power system is financially unviable and operationally
impaired. It relies on heavy government capital injection in the form of
unaffordable subsidies, which increases the fiscal deficit, promotes deficit
financing and loss of reserves, and leads to the inevitable depreciation of
the currency. Despite periodic capital injection, circular debt continues to
grow. It is difficult to get an accurate figure of the net outstanding debt
because of significant overlaps and because it is a moving target. To give
some idea of magnitude, the gross receivables in the energy sector are
currently estimated at $6 billion. By some estimates, the net figure has
260grown from approximately $3.5 billion in June 2009 to $4.8 billion today.
In addition to the state-owned power system and IPPs, it affects virtually
all entities in the commercial energy sector. For the state-owned power
system alone, the government is now contemplating a $1.3 billion
injection to close the current arrears gap.

Some critics consider this crisis to be self-inflicted and stemming from
lack of payment discipline but, when seen through the lens of IEP, its causes
can be attributed, in large part, to the absence of the IEP mechanism. This
would explain the conspicuous lack of a long-term integrated approach and
the reliance on stop-gap measures. The result is that, while power system
capacity in Pakistan is 19,855 MW and the peak demand is 14,500 MW, the
power system can only meet 70 per cent of the peak demand; hence the acute
shortages, brown-outs and black-outs.

IPPs, embroiled in the circular debt issue, deserve special mention.
Following the adoption of the 1994 Private Power Policy, nineteen IPP
projects achieved financial closure in record time for which Pakistan was
internationally acclaimed. The US Energy Secretary, after a visit to Karachi
in September 1994, described it as the best energy policy in the entire
world. By 1998, however, termination procedures had been initiated for
eleven of the projects on technical grounds and allegations of corruption,
causing a major reversal of Pakistan's image at a particularly problematic
time for the economy. A long and painful process of renegotiating the
projects was started.

The technical causes were wide-ranging and complex. In retrospect,
some simple lessons can be drawn. First, while incentives for private
power generation alleviated power shortages in the short term, too much
capacity was contracted with insufficient attention to least cost expansion.
In times of depressed demand, the liability of the government-owned
power system becomes particularly prohibitive. Under the provisions of
the Power Purchase Agreements, the system is obligated to take the power
or pay for it, guaranteeing the IPPs an agreed minimum plant factor.
Second, the magnitude and nature of private investment was not in synch
with the level of sector reform and national socio-economic and
governance reforms. Third, it would have been prudent to stagger the
competitive bids over a number of years to enable bidders to better assess
the risk and reduce their bids. Rapid response times inevitably impose
261upward pressures on bids. Fourth, staggering IPP bids, thereby reducing
capacity requirements, would allow the power system operator to reassess
demand and adjust contracted capacity and timing of subsequent projects.
Fifth, a more transparent and politically acceptable approach in
accommodating changing country conditions would have helped. 

Finally,
contracts should be open to a mutually acceptable re-negotiation process.

Many of the above issues, particularly those relating
to demand and supply considerations and optimal system expansion,
would have been pre-empted had an IEP system been in place.
One of the most significant benefits of IEP is the ability to quantify
the cost penalty or the opportunity cost of pursuing sub-optimal plans—
vital for a country confronted with so many issues, for which less-than-
optimal choices often become necessary. A prime example is Pakistan's
need to address issues of poverty and inequitable income distribution.
Access to and affordability of energy is a critical concern among the urban
and rural poor. This inevitably leads in the shorter term to subsidies and
cross-subsidisation. Some might question the use of sophisticated
planning techniques if, in the end, substantial 'deviations' from the optimal
scenario would be necessary. This is a fallacy. There is nothing wrong
with subsidies if their design meets certain basic criteria. Subsidies should
be clearly targeted to the poor through a system of means testing. They
must be affordable to the national economy. If not, their inevitable
withdrawal would have dire consequences for the very group they were
meant to benefit. They must be transparent, i.e. not concealed in quasi-
budgetary transactions. The moral hazard of encouraging waste would need
to be minimised. IEP, complete with a range of scenarios and impact
analyses, provides the tool to assess the impact of subsidies in the energy
sector and to the national economy as a whole and thus make informed
choices.

Pakistan is not unique in excluding non-commercial energy in its
analyses. There are two main reasons for this. First, data on non-commercial
energy is less reliable and errors in estimation could lead to a significant
bias in the energy balance because of the large share of non-commercial
energy in the total mix. Second, the primary energy equivalence for non-
commercial fuels is particularly misleading because in general, they are
burned at much lower efficiencies than commercial fuels and their share in
useful energy consumption is consequently lower. However these are not
262plausible reasons for the omission. Without traditional energy, meaningful
policy and investment priorities cannot be established for the sector as a
whole. IEP would highlight the need for significantly upgrading non-
commercial energy data and for focusing on the utilisation efficiency of non-
commercial energy.

Energy consumption in particular sectors such as households has been
defined as the energy delivered to that sector. It does not take into account the
efficiency of utilisation of the delivered energy, known as end-use efficiency.
IEP, in promoting conservation measures and defining conserved energy as
adding to energy supply, forces energy planners to focus on end-use
efficiency rather than on delivered energy alone. In Pakistan this will
inevitably lead to measures such as the dissemination of higher-efficiency,
tested and tried cook-stoves rather than the reliance on traditional wasteful
methods such as 'three-stone' fires.

With nearly half of Pakistan's total requirements met by non-
conventional sources such as fuelwood, the current neglect means ignoring
nearly half of the country's energy supply source and half of its
population—hardly justifiable for a country fighting the scourge of
poverty and trying so hard to improve its lagging social indicators.
In the light of the evidence presented above, the conclusion is simple.
The elusive fundamental in Pakistan's energy sector reform is IEP and the
imperative of adopting this is unquestionable. With it, Pakistan's policy-
makers can finally go beyond what needs to be done to how it is to be done.
Moreover the time to act is now. Necessary skills exist in Pakistan and,
with political will and a modicum of external assistance, the recovery of
the energy sector can be undertaken fairly swiftly. On that will depend the
country's economic revival.
