Can Pakistan and India move away from their enduring rivalry and
make peace? Can the shadow of the November 2008 Mumbai terrorist
attacks be removed by sustained diplomatic engagement between the two
countries?

This chapter seeks to answer these questions by reviewing the record
of diplomatic efforts and identifying the obstacles in the path of progress
while underscoring the importance of a peace process whose absence can
provide determined spoilers on both sides ample opportunity to push the
nuclear-armed adversaries toward deadly confrontation.

Is a Peace Process in Place?

A peace process can be defined as concerted efforts by parties in
dispute to seek a resolution of their conflict through dialogue and
negotiations. The initiation of a peace process normally follows incidents of
armed conflict between the parties in dispute. Usually it takes place with
the support of interested third parties. The onset of the peace process, while
reducing escalatory pressures for violence, does not guarantee that peace will
necessarily follow. In fact, the failure of the peace process to yield positive
results may enhance possibilities for the outbreak of violent conflict.
The existence of an India-Pakistan peace process is evidenced by
several factors. First, both countries have regularly engaged in bilateral talks
to resolve differences on a wide range of issues: border demarcation, boundary
adjustment, water distribution, trade and commerce issues, protection of
minorities, Kashmir, conventional and nuclear confidence building measures
(CBMs). Since 1997 all these issues have been discussed as part of the composite
dialogue involving eight issues: Peace and Security including CBMs; Jammu
and Kashmir; Siachin; Sir Creek; Tulbul, Wullar, Baghlihar and Kishenganga
water projects; terrorism and drug trafficking; economic and commercial
cooperation; promotion of friendly exchanges in various fields. Second, India-
333Pakistan bilateral talks have yielded a large number of agreements that have
a fairly good compliance record by each country (see Table 1).

Three, despite lack of agreement on Kashmir, both countries have since
the mid-1990s made conscious efforts to push the peace process forward.
Four, since their overt nuclearisation in May 1998, the world community has
repeatedly called upon the two nations not only to exercise restraint but also
to forego use and the threat of the use of force in settling differences. All the
four nuclear crises between India and Pakistan—1986-87 Brasstacks, the
1990 Kashmir crisis, the 1999 Kargil conflict, and the 'compound crisis' of
summer 2002—were defused with the help of Washington as a third party.

### Roadblocks to Peace

There are 4 sources of the enduring enmity between Islamabad and New Delhi.

1. A clash of opposing ideologies in the diametrically opposed Islam and Hinduism. 

To S.M. Burke, 'Centuries of dedication to such diametrically opposed systems as Islam and Hinduism could not but nurture an utterly different outlook on the outside world among
their respective followers.'

2. Pakistan's fear of India's sheer size and the pair's strategic and economic asymmetry.

Howard Wriggins:

However unjustified Indian leaders may have thought it, Pakistan's overriding concern vis-a-vis India' is the 'fear of India's size, the size of its army... and fear compounded out of not infrequent public statements by prominent Indians regarding the tragedy of partition and reiterating the inherent unity of the subcontinent.

3. The legacy of the trauma of partition.

This has carried over in the mindsets of those who took over the administration of the two countries. Leo Rose and Richard Sisson comment: 'Most of the political and social concepts that dominated the ideology and psychology of the narrow elites that controlled these two movements survived into the independence period and have not disappeared.' 

4. The unresolved issue of Kashmir.

Besides being the fundamental cause of the first two wars between India and Pakistan, and a trigger for the May-July 1999 conflict in Kargil, Kashmir is now universally recognised as a nuclear flash point and a serious international security issue. 

Between 2004 and 2007, New Delhi and Islamabad used back channel links to develop a shared understanding in the form of a 'non-paper' for a final resolution of the dispute.

Both sides had reached a broad agreement on 5 elements of the Kashmir settlement:

1. No change in the territorial layout of Kashmir currently divided into Pakistani and Indian areas
2. The creation of a 'softer border' across Line of Control (LoC).
3. Greater autonomy and self-governance within both Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of the state.
4. A cross-LoC consultative mechanism.
5. The demilitarisation of Kashmir at a pace determined by the decline in cross border terrorism.'

This understanding failed to materialise due to the fall of the Musharraf regime in 2008.

<!-- Because of the divisive impact of these factors relating to ideology, the
violent legacy of partition, images of the enemy, and the unresolved issue of
Kashmir, India and Pakistan have been constrained to pursue their security
policies within the framework of unilateral security, where intended gains for
one side are supposed to result in an equivalent loss for the other. But this
unilateralist way of thinking about security has become untenable in the wake
of South Asia's passage to overt nuclearisation in May 1998. -->
