Education lies at the heart of Pakistan's multiple challenges. If Pakistan
is to emerge as a stable, moderate polity able to reap dividends from its
burgeoning population it must be able to provide the young and future
generations both personal safety and a decent livelihood. This requires
relative peace, an environment conducive for economic growth, and a
workforce that can power progress. Vital to such a turnaround is a well-
educated population. Only through massive quantitative and qualitative gains
in education can Pakistan produce the skill set required to drive the
economy efficiently and produce a critical mass of well-informed and
visionary leadership it so badly needs. Equally important, it is only through
high quality, value-neutral education that Pakistan can challenge the salience
of the Islamist discourse that threatens to radicalise society and drive youth
energies towards destructive—often violent-channels.

This means that education should not only be a development priority
but also a strategic one. Pakistan's education performance is a tale of
unfulfilled expectations which has caused disaffection and alienation among vast
segments of society. The immediate future needs to be seen as a corrective phase
that requires holistic interventions in the education sector. The chapter begins
by outlining the conceptual underpinnings of the empirical analysis to follow.

This is followed by consideration of the Pakistani education sector's
performance and implications for society. In the final section concrete steps
are identified that can help bring about the required transformation.


### Education as an 'Expectation Builder'

Modern societies grasped the importance of a well-educated polity very
early on. In recent decades however, investment in human capacity has
become a top priority for international, multinational, and national efforts.
Conventional wisdom suggested that education was critical for a society to
produce a skilled labour force that could operate as productive members of
the economy. Over time, education has increasingly been seen as a force
multiplier capable of having a much broader impact—both positive and
negative—on societies than merely producing a skilled work force. High
264quality education can provide the means of social mobility and act as a source
of contentment to people. It can contribute to peace, drive societal narratives
and thus mould the very outlook of communities positively, as well as
inculcate a civic sense among citizens. On the other hand, poor educational
standards or agenda-driven education can contribute to a sense of alienation
and deprivation, lead to internal discord and violence, and channelise societal
energies in unproductive directions.

The discussion here draws on the 'expectations' literature. Education is
seen as an 'expectation builder'; it raises anticipations at three distinct stages. To
begin with, demand for education creates expectations among parents and
children that the state would be able to provide opportunities for acquiring
education. Once access to education is provided, consumers begin to expect
qualitative improvements. The third stage of expectations stems from the fact
that the schooling process itself has attached to it hopes of finding
commensurate employment.

The literature talks of 'unfulfilled expectations' as a major worry. A
failure to fulfill expectations in terms of access to or quality of education
could be a function of state incapacity, deliberate policies that exclude certain
segments of society, or education content that is ill-suited to the
requirements of modern economies and societies. Regardless, it implies
that those who miss out are not fit to contribute to the economy optimally.
Moreover they tend to feel aggrieved and may become alienated and
marginalised from their communities. Alienation, deprivation, and
marginalisation of youth are in turn linked to radicalisation and discord.
However, the failure of education does not have to be absolute to
cause alienation. Particular segments of societies can be at a loss even if
the rest of the society is progressing. In fact, the literature argues that
feelings of alienation and marginalisation are often harboured when
access to opportunities is unequal rather than absent. Discussing young
males in particular, Collier (2000, p. 94) supports the relative deprivation
hypothesis. Kaplan (1996) concurs with this view, arguing that
discrimination against specific segments of society can cause the
disadvantaged to resort to violence. Indeed, global studies on the linkage
between education and violence point to a correlation between conflict
outbreak and persistence and low educational attainment. Countries with the
lowest rates of primary school enrolment show greater incidence of conflict.
Secondary education is also believed to be inversely related to prevalence of
265internal conflict.

Educational content can also be used deliberately to pursue a
particular agenda or create a sense of deprivation among students.
Learning materials can emphasise a particular version of history or a
worldview that may create an exclusionary and discriminatory mindset.
Curricula, learning materials, and teaching methods that promote narrow-
minded outlooks and intolerance are least suited to peaceful co-existence.
Much too often, communities that have experienced extreme forms of
conflicts have had divisive education systems. Rwanda, Nazi Germany,
and South Asian countries like Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan are all cases
in point.

The problem of perceived alienation or deprivation is compounded
in contexts already ridden by violence and extremism. Here, the
frustration caused by low educational attainment, agenda-driven content,
or a mismatch between education and economic opportunities provide a
perfect opportunity for militants to recruit cadres.
Grounding the argument in the 'education as an expectation builder'
premise, the following discussion examines the Pakistani case in some
detail. It argues that the Pakistani education sector has led to unfulfilled
expectations at each of the three mentioned stages: there has been a failure
to provide enough education, to provide good quality education, and to
provide amicable livelihoods to the educated. Consequently, a vast proportion
of the Pakistani population is ill prepared for a modern economy and is
vulnerable to internal discord and violence.


### Recounting 'Expectation Failures' in Pakistani Education

Stage I: Failure to Provide. Pakistan has made progress with regard
to most education indicators over time. The total net primary enrolment
rate has increased from 33 per cent in 1991 to 66 per cent in 2008. The
ratio of female to male primary enrolment has increased from 52 per cent
to 83 percent. Meanwhile, the total primary completion rate as a
percentage of the relevant age group has risen from 50 percent to 60 per
cent in the corresponding period. The total adult literacy rate has also
increased from 26 per cent in 1981 to 54 per cent in 2008. Recent
developments have yielded somewhat greater progress exemplified by the
266fact that youth literacy at 68.9 per cent is 15 per cent higher than adult
literacy.

But progress remains poor both in absolute terms as and relative to
the rest of the South Asian region and other lower middle-income
developing countries. With the exception of Afghanistan, Pakistan has the
lowest education outcomes in the region. Half of Pakistan's population is
illiterate, the country has the second highest number of out of school
children in the world (9.5 million in 2005), it suffers from high drop-out
rates even at the primary level, and there is substantial gender disparity at
every education level. In fact, despite overall quantitative gains the gender
gap has widened between 1981 and 2008 from 20.6 to 26.8 per cent. Rural-
urban and interprovincial disparity also continues to persist.
Interprovincial disparity in youth literacy is just as high as in adult
literacy.

It is evident then that the Pakistani education system has failed to
reach a large proportion of its eligible population. The problem is
principally a supply side one. For one, the difficulty of accessing educational
facilities keeps children away. A number of surveys register complaints
about having to travel long distances to reach schools, especially for girls
in rural areas. Lack of basic facilities in schools such as electricity, drinking
water and toilets are additional deterrents to school attendance. Out of
163,914 public schools (including 10,651 mosque schools), 10.5 per cent
operate without a building; 6.1 per cent are kacha schools; 61 per cent
lack electricity; 36.5 per cent lack drinking water; 42.4 per cent lack
latrines; 44.3 per cent lack boundary walls; 3.8 per cent are declared
dangerous while another 16.5 per cent are in need of major repair. Almost
10,000 schools are officially designated as non-functional. Vacant teacher
posts and absenteeism are also high across all provinces. Unaffordable costs,
lack of interest in education, and for females, cultural sensitivities are other
commonly cited reasons for children being out of school.

The present situation represents a failure on the part of the state to
deliver on its fundamental duty to provide basic educational opportunities
to its citizens. Those left out are people who will at best be suboptimal
participants in the economy during their productive work life. Their sheer
numbers represent a massive lost opportunity for Pakistan. Also, the
current situation is bound to engender frustration and disaffection across
the board. This is especially the case for a society like Pakistan's where
demand for education is very high. In a Population Council (2002) survey
whose findings have persistently been confirmed by subsequent research, 80
per cent of the young males and over 70 per cent of their female
counterparts included in the survey expressed a desire to be educated at
secondary and tertiary levels. The supply­ demand gap then is an obvious
alienating factor. Internal tensions become even more likely when one
considers that gender and geographical location within Pakistan are
significant determinants of access to education.

A number of reasons can be adduced for this dismal state of affairs.
The 2009 National Education Policy correctly identifies the two primary
reasons as the 'commitment gap' and the 'implementation gap'. The
commitment gap is reflected in the low resource allocation to the sector. In
2009-10, public expenditure on education was 2 per cent of GDP, the
lowest in South Asia. This is representative of Pakistan's average
educational spending; in the last fifteen years, average education
expenditures have been a mere 2.1 per cent of GDP. Even within education,
the bulk of the investment has been channelled to a few well-maintained
higher education institutions implying that the benefits of the public
subsidy of education are primarily availed by the higher income groups. The
primary and secondary education tiers which are believed to be crucial to
developing human capacity en mass have been neglected.
The implementation gap directly affects governance of the sector as
well as the allocation and utilisation of resources. The lack of a planning
culture and capacity and weaknesses in administrative capacity and
accountability mechanisms result in only 20 to 30 per cent of the allocated
funds being utilised effectively. Corruption, manifested in funds siphoned
away for personal gain, influence in the allocation of resources, in the
recruitment, training and posting of teachers, in selection of textbooks, and in
269the conduct of examinations and assessments are significant implementation
challenges that decision-makers have struggled to address.
Stage II: Failure to deliver quality. Pakistan's education sector is
anomalous in that it has three parallel and largely unconnected systems of
education operating simultaneously. These are the public and non­elite
private schools, the elite private schools, and the religious seminaries—the
madrasahs. Approximately 67 per cent of the school going children are
enrolled in public schools, close to 29 per cent are in private schools—the
majority of these are in the non-elite variant—and 4 per cent attend
madrasahs (see table 2). The three systems follow their own curricula,
teaching methods, and examination processes. Consequently, quality of
education and the type of student body in each vary greatly. Only the public
education system is fully regulated by the government.

The three education systems are broadly stratified along three
dimensions: socio-economic, qualitative, and ideological. The madrasahs
system largely caters to children from the poorest segment of society. The
majority of public school and non-elite private school students belong to the
lower-middle to middle socio-economic groups. Elite private schools apply
stringent socio-economic screening and are reserved exclusively for the rich.
So isolated are these systems that students go through their school life (and
even adult life) without having the opportunity to engage intellectually
across systems. The education sector therefore ends up producing three
distinct cohorts from within the Pakistani youth, each quite cut-off from
the other.

In terms of quality, madrasahs have the greatest mismatch with the
requirements of modern economies. They are essentially geared towards
producing cadres suitable only for the clerical sphere; this makes them
misfits for mainstream employment opportunities. The public education and
a large proportion of the non-elite private schools—together account for
the overwhelming majority of Pakistani students—also suffer from
extreme qualitative shortcomings. This is manifested in the learning
outcomes, curricula, textbooks and other learning materials, assessments,
teacher quality, and the learning environment. Although they teach all
subjects expected of modern school systems, they follow fixed syllabi,
which encourage rote learning—memorisation. The medium of
instruction in public schools is predominantly Urdu; they even lack the
capacity to develop a minimum level of proficiency in the English
language, which is necessary for most white-collar jobs. The relatively
small number of elite private schools are the only ones that provide decent
quality education. They use English as the medium of learning and are
ahead of the others in terms of teaching standards and learning outcomes.
Most of them encourage objectivity and creative thinking among students.
It is hardly surprising then that parents who send their children to private
schools are found to be far more satisfied than those whose kids attend
public schools or formal madrasahs.

The third layer of stratification is ideological. Though there is
considerably greater overlap across systems in this case, in general one can
attribute distinct and often irreconcilable world visions across the three
systems. Pakistani madrasahs may not be actively engaged in producing
militants as the West has suspected for long but they do produce graduates
with narrow-minded ideological biases. In her research on madrasahs,
Christine Fair (2006; 2007) argues that these cadres are much more likely
to sympathise with Islamists where they are welcomed and given a
positive identity. The syllabi of the public schooling system are closely
managed by the state and provide a highly skewed historical narrative that
is nationalistic and creates a siege mentality by portraying Pakistan as
being perpetually under threat from all corners. The content also meshes
Islam with nationalism and presents the two as being intrinsically linked.
The roots of this anomaly lie in the 1980s when agenda-driven education
was deliberately used as a political tool and textbooks were rewritten to
271inject a definitive anti-India and pan-Islamic bias. The elite private
schools, while being bound by the state to follow the prescribed narrative
in subjects such as Pakistan Studies, have more leeway given their
unregulated nature. In addition, the economic stratum their students
belong to allows them more physical and informational exposure to the
Western style of life and leaves them less susceptible to accepting the
curriculum biases at face value.

The divergent outlooks of these three cohorts are evident from who
they look up to and which direction they want their country to take.
Madrasah students tend to be amenable to the extremist world-view.
Students from the public schools, who are perhaps most representative of
mainstream society, idealise legendary Muslim historical figures but do
retain some admiration for figures known for their anti-West outlook.
Products of the private schools talk fondly of Hollywood stars,
personalities in the arts and theatre, international sportsmen and the like.
Overwhelming majorities of private school-educated youth seem to view
Turkey as a model for Pakistan to replicate. This is fundamentally different
than the preference of their less privileged counterparts who are more
likely to mention Iran or Saudi Arabia.

Frustration, alienation, internal discord and polarisation are built
into the education system. The isolation and divergent outlooks of the
three variants make for a divided polity. Indeed, the perceptions of the
country's youth validate this. Children of the elite are highly dismissive of
their Urdu medium counterparts and intolerant of young rural men,
especially those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. A sizable
segment from within the elite schools considers itself superior and more
progressive than the rest. Madrasah students on the other hand blame the
elite for having robbed them of necessary resources and causing hardship
for the rest of society. Their sense of alienation and deprivation is shared
by the public school, and to a lesser extent non­elite private school
students and provides an opening to Islamists to cash in on a 'haves versus
have nots' narrative. These disparate visions also make it virtually
impossible to forge a consensus on a national narrative in Pakistan.

Stage III: Failure to provide livelihoods. Educational attainment is
a double-edged sword. While lack of education disqualifies youth from
attaining economic mobility and is thus undesirable, high level of
272education without the requisite outlet to apply skills raises expectations
which, if unfulfilled for long, can create an 'expectation-reality disconnect'.
Again, the latter makes the excluded disgruntled with the system, which not
only keeps potentially productive human capacity from engaging in
constructive endeavours but also acts as a violence inducing factor.

Surveys suggest that an overwhelming majority of young men and
women in Pakistan want to work provided suitable opportunities—
commensurate with their educational attainment—are made available.
Unfortunately, access to desirable employment in Pakistan is as unequal as
provision for high quality education. While Pakistan's labour market has
expanded, and the unemployment rate has declined to an impressive 5.32 per
cent, the improvement is unable to keep up with the large pool of employable
youth. In fact, youth employment has only dropped marginally since 1990
and even many who were employed at one time fell back into the unemployed
category. To be sure, the majority of non-elite young citizens can only find
relatively menial jobs and are thus underemployed. The public sector is
inherently corrupt and job openings are rarely awarded on merit. Children of
the poor, with generally little access to the corridors of power and already
disadvantaged by the poor skill set developed in public schools, are invariably
the first to be denied these prized positions.

The private sector has expanded tremendously in recent years and
presents many more lucrative opportunities. Ironically however, the
combination of the private sector's growth and a virtual breakdown of the
public sector act to increase the inequality in opportunities for graduates of
private versus public schools. Private sector firms solicit employees with
diverse exposures, a broad knowledge base, good English language skills, and
robust analytical ability. The only young adults that fit the bill are products
of elite private schools or foreign colleges (the latter are exclusively members
of elite households). In fact, so blatant is the bias against public, non-elite
private, and madrasah graduates that recruiters explicitly put a premium on
foreign and elite local degrees. A disproportionate amount of entry level
positions thus end up going to the already rich, leaving those from lower
socio-economic classes underemployed. For educated (even if poorly) young
men, underemployment ends up having just as much of an alienating effect
as unemployment.

There is evidence aplenty of the coming crisis. Increasingly, reasonably
eloquent, post-secondary degree holders are seeking financial help—that
is to say, begging—on the streets of urban towns in Pakistan. These are
273young men very different from the stereotypical beggars that dot the
streets of Pakistani cities and have been forced to the street by the labour
market crunch. Detailed discussions with such individuals reveal great
contempt for a state that cannot provide opportunities. There is also envy
and resentment against the elite who are believed to have deliberately
created entry barriers for the poor, and there is a sense of alienation
from the larger society.

### Reversing Failure

Inability to reverse these failures will not only limit Pakistan's
economic growth but carries the potential of rupturing the very fabric of
society though polarisation and unrest. While there is very little hard
evidence for education having contributed directly to terrorism in
Pakistan, anecdotal evidence combined with profiles of most actors
involved in terrorist attacks does suggest a linkage. Indeed, it would be
naive to believe an absence of any correlation. The mechanisms through
which this connection would be playing out are aptly described by
Winthrop and Graff (2010) as:

1. Poor education causing grievances for those left out.
2. Education creating narrow world views.
3. Education failing to instil civic citizenship.
4. The context providing opportunities for militant recruitment.

Future challenges in terms of reversing the identified failures in
education are likely to be even more daunting than in the past. A major
reason is the severe demographic pressure. Pakistan possesses one of the
largest youth bulges in the world. Over sixty-five million are between ages
zero and fourteen and are thus either currently at school or will enter
school life in the coming decade. Furthermore Pakistan is only half way
through its demographic transition and the current rate of 3.8 births per
female is set to carry Pakistan's youth bulge well beyond 2025. This
implies an extremely large cohort whose educational needs will have to be
met if Pakistan is to extract positive demographic dividends. According to
Mahmood (2009), barring accelerated improvement Pakistan confronts a
situation where 28.2 million of its citizens will be out of school in the year
2030.

The economic signs are not encouraging for the short to medium
term either. Pakistan will have an additional four million employable youth by 2030 taking the total number to twenty-one million. The stock of unemployed youth will have reached six million in 2030 unless unemployment is kept below 4% which is virtually impossible in the near term
according to official estimates. The increased pace of urbanisation adds to the
conundrum as expectant youth will move to the cities to find livelihoods, only
to be frustrated by the modest absorptive capacity of Pakistani towns. The
literature on the subject suggests that such a development encourages urban
youth radicalisation.

Simply put, Pakistan faces a monumental task in halting and then
reversing the decline in the education sector. Failure is not an option given
that the state of education will determine Pakistan's economic progress, its
overall societal outlook, magnitude of internal tensions, and most
importantly, the state's ability to provide citizens with personal safety and an
environment favourable to sustainable progress.

#### Stage 1: Correcting the failure to provide. 

The ultimate goal for policymakers is to provide a level playing field for students irrespective of
their caste, creed, location, family's economic capacity and religion. Not only
must access to education improve, but it must be spread evenly across the
entire citizenry. 

This will be challenging as Pakistan's present youth
development statistics suggest high disparity across socio-economic strata,
schooling systems, and physical location. All future policies must remain
cognizant of the explosive ramifications of neglecting underprivileged
citizens in peripheral areas.
Financial outlays for education must increase significantly in the
coming years. Successive governments have committed themselves to
increasing spending on education but progress has been slower than planned.
No matter how politically challenging, education's share as a proportion of
GDP must be enhanced to at least the developing country average in the
immediate term. In addition, conscious effort must be undertaken to ensure a
better balance on spending between administrative and development
expenditures within the sector.

Better governance and transparency are buzzwords repeated ad
nauseam in discussions of institutional reform. The challenge is great and
lacks an immediate solution. But there is no alternative to generating the
political will and capacity for better management of the education sector and
ensuring that educational allocations are made efficiently. Institutional
duplication and organisational inefficiencies need to be addressed across the
275board. As a start, the ambiguities about the different roles of the Federal and
Provincial governments in education need to be mapped and clarified.

Policy continuity is also essential.
As a complementary policy strand, there is need for greater
empowerment of those with a direct stake in education. The idea of
establishing functional School Management Committees (SMCs) is
correct provided they are given the needed authority and independence to
ensure that schools function, teachers are present, and students attend
regularly. The SMCs now in place are largely ineffectual.
Given that dropout and completion rates are significantly correlated
to poverty, reduction in tuition fees in public schools and increased
allotment of need-based scholarships and free textbooks and uniforms
should be encouraged. The Punjab government undertook such a program
with mixed results. While the program was subsequently rolled back, its
experience can be studied and improved upon as a similar initiative is
launched across Pakistan.

Conditional cash transfer programs have increasingly become
popular and shown to raise school enrolment and retention in a number of
countries such as Mexico, Colombia, Nicaragua and Brazil. Pakistan has
introduced a few demand size incentives such as involving communities
in social service delivery but the explicit use of cash transfers to ensure
higher school attendance is largely missing. Moreover, the programs that
do involve communities are small relative to the size of the problem, focus
on particular provinces, are not integrated, and their targeting and
administration is weak. International best practices could be used to
improve Pakistan's efforts in this realm.
A positive development in recent years has been the mushrooming
of non-elite private schools, especially in Punjab and Sindh. These schools
are playing an increasingly significant role in extending educational
services particularly in rural areas where the largest growth in private
schools is occurring. Further encouragement of private schools along with
innovative public-private partnerships where the public sector is found
wanting is a desirable policy intervention.

### Stage 2: Correcting the failure to deliver quality. 

Qualitative improvements in education are bound to lag behind quantitative gains but
276efforts must strive to keep this gap as narrow a possible. The key lies in
transforming the public school system and ensuring its uplift so that it can
match its elite counterpart. Areas that need attention include the
development of new teaching methods that promote creative thinking,
qualitative benchmarks for student learning, and standards for teacher
recruitment, among others. The concrete steps required are well understood
and rehearsed. The political will to implement them is often lacking and needs
to be evolved.

Largely at the behest of donors, Pakistan has paid substantial attention
to teacher professional development. The effort should be reinforced from
within. A step in the right direction has been made with the establishment of
the National Professional Standards for Teachers in Pakistan. Efforts must be
made to ensure the quality of teacher education and implementation of the
standards.

In the short run, a stop-gap measure could entail setting up a program
to bring in a significant number of foreign teachers or those from Pakistan's
substantial diaspora in the West, especially ones trained to teach English
language and basic mathematics and sciences. These teachers could be placed
across the various levels of public schooling throughout the country.
To complement these efforts, stronger public-private partnerships have
to be forged to help overcome some of the capacity constraints in the public
sector. The government has initiated programs like 'adopt a school' whereby
non-government organisations are encouraged to take over management of
public schools. There is significant interest but the scope of such efforts is
very limited at present. A well-crafted incentive structure needs to be put in
place and bureaucratic hurdles removed to encourage more non-government
entities to consider adopting schools.

The madrasah education system needs urgent reform to allow it to
prepare students for modern economies while retaining their faith based
focus. The agenda to transform the existing ones is oft expressed but political
constraints and fear of resistance have prevented the government from doing
anything significant. A more realistic alternative may be to set up parallel
madrasahs run either by the public or private sector that utilises teachers able
to offer balanced theological study in combination with teaching modern
subjects.

With regard to public sector education syllabi, the emphasis should be
on revising textbooks with the aim of reverting to the content used prior to
Islamisation during the 1980s. The aim is not secularisation of the curricula—
as that would meet resistance from a deeply conservative society. Rather, the
aim should be to remove distortions of history and material that engenders
extremist mindsets. Moreover, the curricula would benefit from greater
emphasis on 'peace education' and teaching that instils a strong civic
sense.

Finally, the government is encouraging private schools to offer 10
per cent of admissions to needy students from underprivileged backgrounds.
This is a step in the right direction and can go a long way in removing the
isolation of students among the three systems. The private sector must be
urged to rigorously enforce this regulation, which is not the case at present.
Stage III: Correcting the failure to provide livelihoods. Pakistan's principal
weakness in economic planning has been an overriding focus on high
macroeconomic growth and not the quality or distributional effects of that
growth. The model has not been inclusive and it is only recently that pro-
poor growth has become part of the mainstream policy discourse. Strong and
sustained macroeconomic growth is imperative to increase the size of the
national pie. To complement this however, initiatives geared to equitable
income distribution need to be taken. This also means providing job
opportunities to the educated unemployed, many of whom come from
disadvantaged social backgrounds.

The government's social safety net initiatives will remain central to
its ability to providing the disenfranchised the requisite livelihood
opportunities. It is encouraging to see an emphasis on employment
schemes and small scale business promotion by the present authorities. The
allocations for such initiatives should be further increased and the
institutional shortcomings that continue to undermine these programs
should be corrected. Special efforts should be made to make these
schemes transparent, perhaps by giving civil society a formal role in
monitoring and accountability.

Vocational training stands out as an obvious avenue to explore in
order to improve opportunities for the uneducated or the poorly educated.
While there has been significant donor and government attention, there
are still just a limited number of vocational training centres in urban areas
278while rural Pakistan lacks these facilities. Even where they exist, they do
not seem to have been instituted under any coherent policy framework.
Moreover, the quality of training is inadequate. Presently, there is lack of
congruity between the local industries and training available at the
institutes. Very little attempt has been initiated to involve the end users in
the operation, management, and program delivery as well as to align the
course contents to the needs of the industry. The lack of interactions
between industries and Technical and Vocational Education Training
(TVET) institutes has therefore resulted in the marginalisation of the
TVET institutions with employers demonstrating little interest in
extending cooperation to the institutions. This is an area where the donor
community has relatively greater experience given its success in other
countries. It could treat this as a priority by coordinating its efforts to
correct the stated shortcomings.

Perhaps the most executable option to ease Pakistan's labour force
burden in the next decade or two is to find adequate opportunities for
labour migration abroad. Pakistan has used this safety valve to good effect
in the past by sending a large number of its skilled and unskilled labour
force across the world. While economic constraints in recipient countries
and the 'extremist' tag attached to Pakistan in global perception has dented
the traditional outflow of labour, the international community could help
Pakistan in providing fresh avenues for labour absorption. To enhance the
prospects, Pakistan's vocational training could be tailored to the future
demand of various countries projected to have a labour shortage. Friendly
countries could consider special arrangements to allow inflow of
employable Pakistanis.

Education remains central to Pakistan's recovery. Given the current
circumstances, hoping for return to stability without improving education
substantially is a misnomer. The challenge confronting Pakistan is a
daunting one. The state must begin to see education as a right, not a favour
to its people. Even then, the suggested policy measures cannot bring
change overnight. The next decade or so ought to be approached as a
corrective period during which the essential policies will be put in place.
Progress will likely be frustratingly slow but if executed properly these
steps will prepare the ground for more accelerated and visible
improvement in the decade that follows. Should this effort be made, the
Pakistan of 2030 has every prospect of being more and better educated,
279with its society empowered by a better sense of civic responsibility—a
country able to provide job opportunities to all its citizens. This, in turn,
would serve as the essential base on which economic progress and
prosperity can be predicated.
