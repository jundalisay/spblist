In Afghanistan: a war going in the wrong direction, a fatally flawed
election, reconstruction at a standstill and a growing political vacuum that
the Taliban is filling even as some NATO countries contemplate
withdrawing their troops.

In nuclear-armed Pakistan: a long-running multidimensional crisis,
political and ethnic strife, an unprecedented economic depression, and
growing local Islamic extremism which plays host to al Qaeda and the
Afghan Taliban; despite these mounting domestic challenges, Pakistan is
still vying for influence in Afghanistan in anticipation of an eventual
Western withdrawal.

In Washington and European capitals: growing doubts about the
viability of the US-led military campaign in Afghanistan, continuing
suspicions about the intentions of Pakistan's military, the inability to push
ahead with a regional strategy or engage with Taliban moderates, and a
lack of a credible government in Kabul.

The disastrous legacy that President Barack Obama inherited in
Afghanistan is primarily the fault of former President George W. Bush and
his failure to deliver sufficient political, military and economic resources
to both the country and the region writ large. But lest we think revisiting
the past is an unnecessary detour into mistakes no longer relevant, it is
fixing these missteps that are key to preventing a complete radicalisation
of the region.

The descent of Afghanistan to the brink of anarchy was solidified in
2009. It was the result of eight years of blunders, miscalculations and wanton
neglect. It was the Bush team's lack of a strategic agenda for Afghanistan in
three critical areas that led to an inevitable escalation of violence. There were
woefully insufficient US troops and no comprehensive strategy that would
have integrated US military and civilian activity to help the Afghan
government increase capacity, improve governance and speedily build its
security forces. Instead the US armed and financed rapacious warlords, many
320of them members of the former Northern Alliance, which antagonised the
Pashtuns and Pakistan. For several years the Pashtun belt was treated as a war
zone as US Special Forces hunted for al Qaeda and US aircraft carried out
indiscriminate bombing.

Within weeks of winning the victory in Afghanistan, US troops were
training for the invasion of Iraq. Afghanistan became a stepchild as the Bush
administration preserved US resources, money and troops for the invasion of
Iraq. But the insurgency could never have taken off in the way it did without
the Taliban having safe sanctuaries in Pakistan. After losing between 12,000
to 15,000 men the remnants of Taliban fighters and its leadership who had
escaped capture or death arrived in Pakistan and found a safe haven there. Key
figures from the former Taliban regime constituted a new Taliban Shura in
Quetta where many lived with their families.

Second, there was no comprehensive diplomatic or regional approach to
Afghanistan's six direct neighbours, a necessary precondition if Bush's team
was to come to grips with the complex history of these states' interference and
battle for influence in Afghanistan. Two of them, Iran and Pakistan, were
clandestinely backing the Taliban. Still, Pakistan's military ruler, then-
President Pervez Musharraf, remained Bush's hero. And Afghanistan's
influential distant neighbours Russia, India and Saudi Arabia were also
ignored.

Last, there was no political strategy for state building and improving
governance by dealing comprehensively with President Hamid Karzai,
government ministers, warlords, tribal elders, governors, the parliament and
other players.

Setting out clear benchmarks for Karzai and his government to
adhere to should have increased Afghan effectiveness, but Bush's regular
telephone calls to the president were largely wasted on fireside chats.
This culminated in a critical deterioration. In the spring of 2008, large
tracts of Afghanistan in the south and east, and for the first time provinces
around Kabul, were under the control of the Taliban, which began to
appoint its own governors, courts, police and tax collectors to run these
areas.

The Taliban's two greatest assets became its safe havens in
Afghanistan and Pakistan, particularly the recruiting and logistic bases in
Pakistan's tribal areas and Balochistan province, and the uninterrupted
flow of money from the likes of donations, drug sales and kidnappings.
More than half of the country's thirty-four provinces turned into no-
go areas for Afghan government officials, foreign aid workers and even
some NATO forces who were not allowed by their governments to fight the Taliban. 

For the first time since losing its regime, the Taliban had
broken out of its traditional Pashtun ethnic power base in the south,
making it easier to deploy guerrillas to the north and the west in 2009.
The Taliban expansion in 2008 was matched by its extraordinary
progress in improved military tactics: more sophisticated ambushes,
suicide car bombs, mine warfare, multiple urban terrorist attacks, and
targeted killings and kidnappings to demoralise the Afghan public and
Western civilians. In 2009 the Afghan Taliban had all but become a
countrywide movement.

The role Pakistan played from 2001 onwards was critical in shaping
the outcome. The Army which had been deployed in and around FATA
after 9/11 withdrew many of them in early 2002 because of the build-up
of tensions with India, after the storming of the Indian parliament by
Kashmiri militants. For much of that year tensions with India preoccupied
the army allowing al Qaeda and the Taliban to move around at will in
FATA and create new allies among the local Pakistani Pashtun tribes and
other extremist groups in Punjab.

Pakistan's security agency continued to give tacit support to the
Taliban. This was a result of the Army's fear that by backing the US
invasion of Afghanistan, it had inadvertently helped bring to power the
former Northern Alliance, which the military detested because of the
support it had received from Pakistan's regional rivals India, Iran and
Russia. The NA held most of the important ministries in the Karzai
government. The Army was also deeply perturbed at the sudden influx of
Indians into Kabul. The Bush administration did little to avert the build-
up of tensions.

Moreover, the US focus on Iraq and lack of commitment to
rebuilding Afghanistan convinced the Pakistan military that the US would
soon pull out of Afghanistan. Pakistan believed it would be left dealing
with an unstable Afghanistan as it was in 1989 after the Soviets and the
US withdrew from the region. For President Musharraf it made more sense
to hold the Taliban in reserve as a proxy force for Islamabad to influence
future events in Afghanistan, while mistrust between Pakistan and India
and the US, further convinced the military that its policies were the right
ones. In particular the military were deeply riled by the nuclear deal agreed
to by the US and India which legitimised India's nuclear weapons program.

Nevertheless, the ISI did move against al Qaeda, cooperating with
the CIA to arrest several leading figures who were hiding out in Pakistani
cities including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the planner of the 9/11 attacks
and Abu Zubaydah, a key recruiter for al Qaeda.

In retaliation al Qaeda enlisted local Pakistani extremist groups to try and assassinate Musharraf. 

Two unsuccessful suicide attacks were made on his life in December 2003 but even these attacks failed to convince the military that they now faced a growing threat at home from the newfound alliance of al Qaeda, the Pakistani and Afghan Taliban and extremist groups in Punjab. The Army had sidelined these groups after Musharraf ordered their activities in Indian Kashmir to be wound down and he began a back channel peace process with India. 

There was no attempt by the Army to demobilise the Punjabi extremist groups.

In April 2007 Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry who commanded US and NATO forces became the first US general to publicly tell the US Congress, the White House and NATO that it could not win in Afghanistan without addressing Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan. Pressure on the Musharraf
regime began to mount, just as Musharraf himself entered a volatile
political situation at home with rising opposition to his rule.

The stepped-up US pressure led to greater intelligence cooperation between the ISI and the CIA which led to the deaths of several top Taliban commanders including Mullah Akthar Usmani who was killed in December 2006 and Mullah Dadullah in May 2007. Mullah Obaidullah was arrested in March 2007 and later freed by the Pakistanis. 

These losses led to the elevation of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a close companion of Mullah Omar, who now presided over the Taliban's military committee in Quetta. Brader became the de facto field commander of the Taliban as Mullah Omar remained largely in hiding.

The Taliban and Pakistan were seeking to outlast the presence of Western forces and to some extent they were succeeding. As long as the Karzai government failed to govern effectively or provide services and jobs to the people while allowing corruption and drug trafficking to take place, the Taliban were winning by default. Despite the growing US and NATO pressure on the military which faced growing threats from its own Pakistani Taliban, the Pakistan Army refused to abandon the Afghan 323Taliban leadership in Quetta.

In 2008-9 the Taliban moved out of their southern strongholds and expanded into the provinces around Kabul and to Kunduz in the northeast and Herat in the south west. The Taliban were now a national, countrywide movement even though their base remained among the
Pashtun tribes. 

By late 2008 the Taliban controlled some 164 Afghan districts out of a total of 364, compared to control of just thirty in 2003. NATO said the Taliban had shadow governors in thirty-three out of 34 provinces.
