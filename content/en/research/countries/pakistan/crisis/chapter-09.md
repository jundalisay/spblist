Dr Ishrat Husain

In the last two decades theoretical and empirical evidence have offered a new insight: that broader socio-economic development including the distribution of the benefits of growth is determined by the quality of governance and institutions.

Economic policies, however sound or benign
they may be, cannot disperse the gains widely unless the institutions
intermediating these policies are strong, efficient and effective.
Although it is hard to precisely define governance there is wide
consensus that good governance enables the state, the civil society and the
private sector to enhance the well-being of a large segment of the
population. According to the World Bank, governance refers to the manner
in which public officials and institutions acquire and exercise the authority
to shape public policy and provide public goods and services. The key
dimensions of governance are: public sector management, accountability,
the legal framework for development and information and transparency.
Research by the Overseas Development Institute has shown that the
historical context, previous regime, socio-cultural context, economic system
and international environment are the main determinants of governance
and development.
The six core principles identified by Hyden et al. that are related to
good governance are: (a) Participation, (b) Fairness, (c) Decency, (d)
Accountability, (e) Transparency and (f) Efficiency.
Each nation's path to good governance will be different depending on
culture, geography, political and administrative traditions, economic
conditions and many other factors. The scope of activities allocated to the
public and private sector diverges markedly and so does variation in scale.
Yet governments share many features. They face similar responsibilities in
that they need to establish a basic policy framework, provide critical goods
162and services, protect and administer the rule of law and advance social
equity.
What has been the experience of Pakistan with respect to governance
and how has the tension between the goal of collective good of society and
the self-interests of state actors been managed? What can be done to
improve governance and strengthen institutions to promote the welfare of
the majority?
Most observers and analysts within and outside Pakistan firmly
believe that the quality of economic governance and decision-making and
the capacity of the key institutions have gradually deteriorated over time.
Pakistan's main problem in holding on to macro-economic stability,
sustaining economic growth and delivering stability, sustaining economic
growth and delivering public services to the poor is due to weak governance
and a gradual but perceptible decline in institutional capacity. The elitist
nature of the state and the society, and both the conflict and collusion
among the various power structures of the country can explain this
phenomenon. It is not the content of public policies that has been wanting
but the implementation of those policies that has proved to be the major
culprit. The implementation capacity itself is a function of the vision and
objectives of the political leadership, the competence of civil service and the
capabilities of public institutions.
Improvement of economic governance has not been consistently
pursued in Pakistan as implementation requires several decades while
elected and military governments have short-term horizons. Elected
governments, in their pursuit of winning the next election, and military
governments, in their attempts to gain legitimacy, get bogged down in ad-
hoc and occasionally populist measures without addressing the root cause:
that is, building institutional capacity to deliver improved living standards for
the majority of the population and setting up a viable governance structure.
Personalised decision-making according to the whims and caprices of
individuals at the helm has therefore displaced and informed well thought
out institutionalised processes.
Chronic political instability and frequent changes in political regimes
have also caused disastrous consequences for economic governance.
During the 1990s the changes were too many and too chaotic. Invariably,
163the incoming governments abruptly abandoned, discontinued or slowed
down the implementation of the policies, projects and programs
inherited from their predecessors. As institutions take a long time to
nurture, the implementation of projects is spread over a multi-year
period and the impact of policies is felt with considerable time­lag,
premature abandonment caused more damage than good. Starting all
over again and before the benefits started accruing, the government was
either overthrown or had to step down before completing its tenure. The
incoming government began the cycle again with a fresh set. The
majority of the populace never witnessed any benefits while unending
costs were incurred by every successive regime.
The situation is quite the opposite in India as aptly summed up by
Arun Shourie:
In India, there is a consensus in practice so that whenever a group
is in office, wherever it is in office, it attempts to do the same sorts of
things. But when it is in opposition, where it is in opposition, it strains to
block the same measures. We have the Communists in West Bengal
garnering credit for implementing reforms in the State that they are
blocking at the Centre.
What is the effect of this unending cycle of politically motivated
economic governance on the majority of the population? A sense of
deprivation and denial of basic economic rights creates feelings of cynicism,
negativism and frustration. The credibility of governments in power—any
government—is completely eroded. Distrust of 'government' becomes so
widespread and credibility of 'government' so low that unfounded and
unsubstantiated rumours, mudslinging and suspicion about their motives
assume a momentum of their own. In the last six to seven years the media,
taking advantage of this widespread lack of government credibility have
taken over the role of an opposition party and thus accentuated feelings of
negativism.
Markets, on the other hand, function on sentiments. If market
participants have confidence in the government and its institutions the
overall result is stability in the markets. But if there is lack of credibility,
an air of uncertainty, and crisis of confidence, the markets become nervous
and jittery and high volatility is witnessed. However good and sound the
164policies may be, under these circumstances, private investment is hobbled
and the economy suffers.
A society with positive attitude will give enterprises far greater
freedom to compete than a society that perceives businesses to be unethical
or in partnership with the government for personal aggrandisement.
Patronage and cronyism in the form of licenses, tariff concessions, tax
exemptions to only a selected few or sale of public assets to the favourites
of the rulers or appointments to key public offices not on merit but on the
basis of loyalty, affiliation and friendship sharpen the negative sentiment.
Therefore the program of privatisation of public enterprises, economically
desirable and so badly needed, has almost been abandoned ever since the
perception, right or wrong, gained currency that the Pakistan Steel Mills
was being sold for too low a price to the cronies of the government.
Alesina's survey of literature suggests that when the values of political-
institutional variables are compared for the ten slowest and ten fastest
growing economies in the sample, the slowest countries tend to be more
ethnically fractionalised and more politically unstable. They also tend to have
much poorer indicators of the rule of law and institutional quality, much
higher black market premium and greater income inequality. Alesina et al.
found that political instability, government fragility (frequency of
government changes and coup d'etats) and socio­political instability (Political
assassinations, riots and revolutions) have a negative effect on growth.
Pakistan fits this model quite well as the frequency of government changes
and socio-economic instability have been associated with low growth and
macro-economic turbulence.
What are the essential ingredients of good economic governance?
Participation, transparency, credibility, rule of Law, efficiency and
accountability are now accepted as essential and are measured through
indicators such as (a) voice and accountability, (b) political stability, (c)
government effectiveness, (d) regulatory burden, (e) rule of law and (f)
corruption.
How does Pakistan fare against these indicators? The common view
about participation is that the Centre has assumed too much power and
authority and this excessive concentration of power has led to
inefficiency, social fragmentation, and ethnic divisiveness. Political
leaders with the help of a small coterie of loyalists exercise absolute power
165and take all important decisions. Dissent within the political parties is
hardly tolerated and Parliaments usually rubber stamp decisions taken by
the leader of the party. Party cadres and National and Provincial assembly
members are usually excluded from decision-making.
Devolution of powers to Local governments introduced in 2001 was
a step in the right direction to promote broader participation but has not
been fully implemented either in letter or in spirit. The incoming
governments, instead of removing the deficiencies revealed during
implementation have decided to dismantle the system simply because it
was the handiwork of the previous government. There is no consensus as
yet on the contours of the new system. Meanwhile whatever access the
common citizens at grass-roots level had begun to experience is being
hampered because the power and authority are gradually reverting to the
provincial capitals. It is quite ironic that while the Provincial legislators
and ministers are quite vociferous in demanding autonomy from the
Federal Government they are the most fierce opponents of devolution of
powers to the local governments. This lack of consistency and absence of
continuity in our governance structure have more hazards than is generally
recognised.
Transparency in the actions of the government can be achieved by
several means, i.e. hearings of Parliamentary Committees, question hours
in the National and Provincial Assemblies, Freedom of Information Act,
removal of several clauses of the Official Secrets Act, introduction of e-
government and investigative reporting by competent and responsible
journalists. Most of these measures exist but more in form rather than
substance. In India, however, the Right of Information Act is bringing
about a silent revolution and civil society is using access to information to
expose corruption in public places and secure the rights of the poor. The
bureaucrats have become more cautious as their actions are open to public
scrutiny. In Pakistan, excessive misuse of newly acquired power by some
media representatives in assassinating the character of political leaders or
public servants without substantiation or evidence may prove to be more
detrimental to the cause of disclosure and transparency.
The rule of law has been a subject of debate in Pakistan since March
2007. The lawyers' movement demonstrated that if a particular community
gets rallied around a legitimate cause it could make a difference. The
166judiciary at the highest level is indeed trying to assert its independence,
enforce the rule of law and expedite disposal of cases. But it is not clear if
a common citizen is any better off today in terms of access to justice, speedy
redressal of grievances, enforcement of contracts or property rights. The
reality is quite sobering.
Efficiency, as measured by government effectiveness either in
maintenance of security of life or property, law and order or delivery of
basic services, has rapidly declined over time. Most institutions entrusted
with these responsibilities at the time of independence were relatively well
run. But the opposite is true after sixty-three years. It is only a rarity that a
public institution is found to be functioning smoothly and effectively. The
differential treatment meted out to the well-to-do and influential segments on
one hand and the rest of the population on the other violates the principle of
fairness and equality for all citizens irrespective of caste, creed or social
status. But this deference to the rich and connected has become the norm of
bureaucratic behaviour in Pakistan. With each change of government a new
cast of political elites and well-connected influentials occupy the space
vacated by their predecessors.
A number of laws and institutions exist in the name of accountability
in Pakistan. Starting from the Public Accounts Committees at the Federal
and the Provincial Assembly level there is a plethora of committees,
bureaus and task forces, charged with this responsibility. The National
Accountability Bureau made a very promising start and instilled some fear
and induced a deterrence effect but this was only for a short period of the
initial three years of the Musharraf government. Soon after, political
compulsions gave way to a pragmatic approach whereby the impartiality
and neutrality of the NAB came under serious questioning. Thus despite a
very strong legal instrument and a well organised infrastructure of
investigation, prosecution and courts, the practice of true accountability
was once again set aside. Accountability has therefore lost its true sense
and meaning in the vocabulary of governance and instead become
associated with retribution, settling political scores and a tool for winning
over opponents and witch hunting the recalcitrant.
The strategy for bringing about improved governance in the context
of Pakistan would involve the breakup of the monopoly of economic and
political power that has been amassed by a small class of politicians, large
167businessmen, military and civil service officers, professionals and zamindars
over the last five decades. The locus of power has become too much tilted
in favour of entrenched interest groups and only a reduction in their power
will be able to improve the quality and standards of living of the majority
of the population. A more difficult question that remains unanswered is:
How can this be done? This is an arduous task and there should be no
illusions about it. All that can be done at this juncture is to spell out a long
term agenda for system-wide reform based on diagnosis, field
observations, evidence and consultations with stakeholders.
As the agenda for governance reforms spans over the tenures of
several elected governments it is difficult to find ownership for these
reforms. An enlightened leadership that has a sense of history and is not
totally driven by the politics of electoral cycles can implement this agenda.
The main ingredients of the agenda for governance and institutional
reform would consist of:
(a) Improving the quality and performance of Civil Services.
(b) Restructuring the organisation of the Federal, Provincial and District
governments.
(c) Revamping the mechanism for delivery of basic public goods and
services.
(d) Strengthening key institutions engaged in economic governance.
(e) Introducing checks and balances in the system by building up the
capacity and authority of certain institutions of restraint.
Civil Service Reforms
In a recent study on Pakistan's Civil Service, the International Crisis
Group (ICG) concluded that:
Decades of mismanagement, political manipulation and corruption
have rendered Pakistan's Civil Service incapable of providing effective
governance and basic public services. In public perception, the country's
2.4 million civil servants are widely seen as unresponsive and corrupt, and
bureaucratic procedures cumbersome and exploitative.
To remedy this situation the best talent available in the country has
to be attracted to the civil services, and a holistic approach that affects the
entire human resource policy value chain has to be implemented.
168The main elements of this value chain are:
(a) Recruitment at all levels and grades of public services should
be open, transparent, merit based with regional representation
as laid down in the Constitution. These principles have been
successfully practiced for decades, e.g. Pakistan Atomic
Energy Commission, National Highway police, State Bank of
Pakistan.
(b) The artificial distinction between superior and non-superior
services has to be replaced by the equality of all services at all
Pakistan, Federal and Provincial levels. Terms and conditions of
all the services in matters of recruitment, promotion, career
progression, compensation, would be similar. The specialists
and professionals would have to be brought at par with the
cadre services.
(c) To provide equality of opportunity to all deserving civil
servants, National Executive Service (NES) and Provincial
Executive Services (PES) ought to be constituted to man all the
Federal and Provincial Secretariat and senior management
positions. The selection should be made on merit by the Public
Service Commission with due regard for provincial quota and
reservation for women. The NES ought to have three
streams—General, Social Sector and Economic Sector, thus
promoting some limited specialisation among our civil
servants.
(d) Training of all civil servants should be mandatory at post-
induction, mid-career and senior management levels.
Promotions to the next grade ought to be linked with
completion of training at various stages in the career.
(e) Promotions and career progression for all public sector
employees should be determined by their on-the-job
performance, responsiveness to public and training outcomes.
(f) The present outdated system of Annual Confidential Reports
(ACRs) should be replaced by the modern Performance
Management System (PMS), which evaluates performance
169objectively and identifies and provides
opportunities to individual employees.
development
(g) Compensation packages should be revamped to reflect market
conditions and a decent living wage and retirement benefits
should be made available to all public sector employees.
Corruption among the majority of civil servants cannot be
curbed by moral persuasion but by providing them with an
adequate compensation package. To keep the wage bill of the
government within the limits of the fiscal deficit, a freeze
should be imposed on fresh recruitment to lower grades except
for teachers, health workers and police.
(h) As most of the interaction between an ordinary citizen takes
place at the district level and the present level of functionaries
consists of ill-trained, poorly paid, unhelpful, discourteous
individuals enjoying arbitrary powers. District Service should
be constituted for each District Government. This will
minimise the political pressures for transfers and postings as
1.2 million out of 1.8 million employees working in the
provinces will remain in their respective District
Governments. Training in technical and soft skills will be
made mandatory for all members of the District services.
(i) Education, health, police and judiciary which are critical for
delivery of basic services should be excluded from the uniform
Basic Pay Scales as it has created serious distortions. The
backward districts and regions are lagging behind as the
teachers, health workers, etc. have no incentive to serve these
areas. Local labour market conditions of demand and supply
should determine the salary structure of teachers, health
workers and other professionals.
(j) Security of tenure of office for a specified period of time
should be guaranteed and implemented. The current practice
of frequent transfer at the discretion of the political leaders has
weakened the moral fabric of the civil servants who cannot
withstand the social and financial costs of dislocation and at-
times ostracisation. Pleasing the boss, whether or not his
170orders are legal, has become the norm, making fair and
impartial dispensation of services difficult.
Restructuring Federal, Provincial and District Governments
Two significant structural changes of a historical nature have taken
place under the PPP-led coalition government that came to power in 2008.
First, powers and functions on the concurrent list under the constitution
have been transferred to the Provinces making provincial autonomy a
more meaningful and operational concept. Second, the 2009 award of the
National Finance Commission has tilted the balance of resource
distribution in favour of the provincial governments. Henceforth, the
provinces rightfully would receive a larger share of the divisible pool. The
next logical step is to form Provincial Finance Commissions and divide
the resources among the Provincial and district governments. This requires
demarcation of responsibilities between the two tiers, which is currently in
a state of flux. The devolution of twelve departments from the Provincial
Government to the districts has improved access to basic services by the
common citizens compared to the previous system. Local elected
representatives are more responsive to the needs of their constituents in
contrast to the Provincial and National Assembly members, who after
getting elected, become quite inaccessible. They spend most of their time
in Islamabad or provincial capitals and visit their constituencies for a day
or two in the week. The local representatives, on the other hand, are
available and accessible 24/7.
The 2001 Local Government suffers from many weaknesses
including excessive strengthening of the office of District Nazim—an
indirectly elected leader. Law and order, maintenance of revenue records
and crisis and disaster management are the functions that require
impartial and neutral administrators. The Local Government System
should eliminate these weaknesses but the present efforts of the
provincial governments and legislators to restore the 1979 Local
Government System and completely dismantle the 2001 system would
be a retrogressive step—a step away from good governance.
Several studies have produced evidence that the choices of
development projects made by local councils had superior outcomes and more
efficient resource allocation and utilisation compared to the centralised
approvals made at the provincial capitals. Twelve devolved departments
171should remain the responsibilities of the District Governments with further
devolution to the Tehsil and Union Councils. Provincial Governments should
formulate policies, set up standards of performance, monitor the finances,
performance and outcomes and take punitive actions against those indulging
in malpractices and corruption. Well-functioning Local Governments can, in
fact, bring political dividends as the population is better served and feels
satisfied with the services rendered by the government. In an ethnically
diverse society a sense of direct participation in local governance is essential.
The main reforms that are required to implement the Eighteenth
Constitutional amendment as well as the NFC award are:
(a) The Federal Government should immediately shed powers and functions
from the concurrent list to the provincial. Given the ethnic and regional
composition of the country and the growing needs of an expanding
population, the provinces and districts have to be empowered. A National
Council of Ministers, consisting of the Federal and Provincial Ministers
working under the Council for Common Interest (CCI) should formulate
the national policies for these transferred subjects. Consequently, the
number of Federal Ministers can be cut to one half and the number of
Divisions reduced by one third. In view of the new challenges that are
facing the country, some new ministries, for example, for energy, human
resource development, social protection etc., should be established.
(b) The existing large number of autonomous bodies and attached
departments and corporations at the Federal and Provincial levels,
should be regrouped and rationalised through merger, privatisation and
liquidation, which will save enormous financial resources that can be
diverted towards basic service delivery.
(c) The District Government has to be strengthened by establishing
administrative linkages between the Union Councils, Town
Committees/Tehsil Councils and District Governments. Executive magistrates
have to be revived and Law and Order, Disaster Management and Land
Record Management taken away from the purview of the District Nazim.
(d) E-government tools and development in digital technology should be
utilised for improving the efficiency of government, reducing the costs of
transactions, conveniencing ordinary citizens, introducing transparency
and reducing discretionary powers and corruption and tracking the
performance and output. Training of those already working in the
172government should make a smooth transition from a paper-based
environment to electronic filing, messaging, sharing and exchanging of
documents, retrieving, reporting and archiving.
(e) Uneven and discriminatory application of government rules, regulations
and instructions are also a source of grief to citizens. A number of junior
functionaries exploit their knowledge of the rules for their personal
benefits. Multiple rules exist on the same subject as there has been no
systematic weeding out exercise undertaken. All government manuals
ought to be revised, updated and then uploaded on the websites of the
government so that they are accessible to the public at large.
Reforms in Delivery of Basic Services
(a) Education is badly needed to increase literacy in the country. Clear
boundaries in the delivery of education have to be demarcated. The
Federal Government should focus on higher education financing,
regulations and standards and curriculum, the Provincial Governments
on college, technical and vocational education and the District
Governments on primary and secondary education up to matric.
Examination reforms have to be carried out to bring the standards of
various boards at par. Management and teaching cadres should be
separated and the career paths for the two cadres should not
discriminate against the teachers.
To bring about coordination and ensure uniformity in standards of
public, private and not for profit schools, a district education board
consisting of eminent citizens of integrity and competence should be
established in each district. The Board should be assisted by the school
management committees empowered to oversee the school's
functioning. Head teachers will enjoy more administrative authority in
running the schools and disciplining the teachers with the Board
arranging inspection of schools periodically. Endowment funds should
be established to provide scholarships and financial assistance to the
poorer talented students. Student vouchers or stipends should be given
to meritorious children from the poor families to attend private schools
of their choice. Private-public partnerships should be encouraged and
offered incentives. Only female teachers should be employed where
possible.
(b) Most of the problems in health care delivery arise not from financial
173constraints but poor management practices. A health management cadre
should therefore be separated from teaching, and service providers and
those selected as health managers trained at the health academies. The
district, teaching and specialised hospital should have their own
autonomous board of directors with full powers for administrative,
financial, legal and human resource matters and accountability. Health
manpower development, the nursing and paramedical professions,
should be given priority. Health regulatory framework should be made
more effective and decentralised to the Provincial Governments.
(c) There is almost a consensus that law enforcement and security
problems that have worsened in the recent years have in large part
reflected the inefficiency, corruption and politicisation of the police
force. The original Police Order 2002 has been compromised by
amendments that have weakened the functioning as well as the
accountability of the police. Legislative amendments and revised
disciplinary rules are needed to allow police officers to perform their
duties in accordance with the Police Order. Disciplinary rules of police
forces should be like other uniformed forces and not fall under the
purview of the Civil Servants Act. Investigation and prosecution are the
weakest functions that are resulting in low rates of conviction by the
courts. Judicial reforms at the lower level are also badly needed both for
expeditious disposal of cases and honest adjudication of disputes. Police
stations should be merged, upgraded, their records computerised and
headed by a directly recruited Grade 17 officer with full responsibility
for watch and ward, investigation and operations. Training, allowances,
mobility, logistics support, lodging and boarding, medical facilities and
welfare of the police force should be reviewed and strengthened. Traffic
Police in all large cities should be organised and operated on the lines
of Motorway Police.
(d) Land records as maintained by the Patwari are the single largest source
of disputes and litigation in the country. The attempts to create a digital
database of land records have remained half hearted. Land revenue
assessment and collection, adjudication and dispute resolution should
remain under the District Government but the maintenance and update
of land records should be taken away from the District Government and
placed directly under the Board of Revenue. Patwari should be replaced
by a Revenue Assistant recruited through Provincial Public Service
Commission. Priority should be given to complete the computerisation
174of land records. Colonisation of Government Lands (Punjab) Act 1912
should be revised for better and transparent allocation and use of state
land.
Strengthening Key Institutions of Governance
About a hundred key public sector institutions in the country such as
PIA, WAPDA, OGDC, PEPCO, Pakistan Railways and Pakistan Steel, suffer from
multiple problems—political interference, nepotism in appointments, over-
manning, subsidised pricing, leakages, waste, and corruption. As a result, the
budget has to allocate almost 20 per cent of all tax revenue to meet recurring
losses or subsidies to those corporations. There have been serious questions
about the appointments of chief executives and the boards of these
organisations. Professionalisation of these institutions is the only way out to
make them financially viable and operationally efficient. The process of
appointments has to be made transparent and merit-based so that the Chief
Executive or the Board member is chosen through a well laid out procedure.
This process should minimise discretionary powers in appointments and
attract capable candidates for these key jobs, which will make an enormous
difference in the quality and efficiency of these organisations.
Several of these institutions are included in the government's agenda
for privatisation. It is imperative that these institutions are privatised sooner
rather than later. For others that are retained in the public sector, and
particularly public utilities and other monopolies, strong regulatory agencies
should be put in place.
The selection process starts by identifying a broad pool of eligible
candidates through open advertising. Only those who meet the job
requirements are selected through a competitive process. They are provided
with operational autonomy, paid competitive remuneration packages and
held accountable for results. Special Selection Board (SSB) should be
constituted for the recruitment of the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and the
Board of Directors in all of these 100 institutions. The SSB, after interviewing
the shortlisted candidates, would submit a panel of three candidates to the
Prime Minister for selection as chief executive and recommend a panel of
names for the membership of the BoD.
175Institutions of Restraint
A few institutions can play a restraining influence on mis-governance
and excessive discretionary powers by the government. These institutions
fall into two categories: formal and informal. Under the former there are two
distinct classes: state-centred and civil society-centred. Historically, the
emphasis has been on state-centred institutions and it is only recently that
the civil society-centred institutions such as the media and NGOs have begun
to assert themselves.
Trust, social capital, and civic norms—the pillars of informal
institutions have also eroded gradually in Pakistan during the last few
decades. Mistrust, suspicion and divisiveness have instead taken hold. So in
effect both the formal and informal institutions of restraint have decayed
and need to be resuscitated.
A schematic representation of the institutions is provided in Table 1.
Among the state-centred institutions the judiciary is at a much higher plane
than any other institution and underpins the whole system of accountability.
In addition to the judiciary, there are at least eight institutions that can make
a difference. The first are the Parliamentary committees particularly the
Public Accounts Committee. Bipartisan committees chaired by respected
and qualified MNAs or Senators and staffed by full time professional and
technical personnel should hold regular hearings, confirm the appointments
of those heading these institutions, receive annual reports of performance,
question reported irregularities and recommend action against those found
responsible for wrongdoings. All procurement contracts above a certain
financial limit, all fiscal exemptions and concessions and modifications to
the tax provisions should be placed before the PAC. The proceedings of these
Committees should be open to the public and the media.
Second is the State Bank of Pakistan. An independent and autonomous
State Bank provides a guarantee against the excessive and irresponsible
actions of politicians and bureaucrats in economic management. At the same
time its regulatory and supervision functions act as a safeguard against
possible malpractices in the award of credit and recovery of loans. It must be
recognised that there has already been significant improvement in the
176working of the State Bank since it was granted autonomy in the 1990s. The
banking sector in Pakistan, after the reforms of the last decade, has emerged
quite strong and was able to withstand domestic and external shocks.

178Third is the Auditor General of Pakistan. The constitutional protection
given to the office of the AG has not been fully utilised in Pakistan to unearth
and detect financial bungling rampant in public sector agencies. The
extended time lapse between the occurrence of the financial irregularity and
actual detection and reporting by the Auditors has improved in recent years.
But the lack of professional expertise and lack of prioritisation among core
and peripheral cases still mute the efficacy of this office. AG organisation
should be converted into a supreme audit institution with autonomy,
resources and accountability to Parliament. The AG should commission third
party audits by professional firms of repute, use the broader 'value for
money' concept and enlarge its scope of activities to cover all major public
sector commercial and industrial enterprises particularly WAPDA/KESC, Sui
Northern/Southern, Railways, Steel Mill, OGDC, PIA, etc.
Fourth is the Securities and Exchange Commission. Capital markets in
Pakistan are very shallow and have not played an effective role in
intermediation required in an emerging market. Corporate governance of the
publicly listed companies is weak and dominated by major family
shareholders with due regard to the right of minority shareholders. Insider
trading is perceived to be widely rampant and disclosure of information
standards is loosely enforced. The SEC needs operational autonomy,
resources and skills to carry out its mandate.
Fifth is the Federal/Provincial Public Service Commission. Most of the
current difficulties in governance have arisen due to the politicisation of the
higher services in the post-1973 period. There is general recognition that the
merit-based system of recruitment, appointments and promotions, served
the nation better and the present sifarish based and buy-the-post system is
causing havoc. The responsibilities for all recruitment and promotions
should be reverted to the Commissions without exception. Only men and
women of proven integrity and impeccable credentials should be appointed
as Chairman and members of the Commission.
Sixth is the Federal/Provincial Ombudsman. The fanfare with which these
offices were established under the Zia-ul-Haq Government died down fairly
quickly. They are now perceived to be grinding the same millstone as the rest of
the bureaucracy. In fact, they can become an effective instrument for quick, fair
179and judicious redress of grievances of ordinary citizens against the arbitrary
harassment of the overzealous or corrupt officials. There are very few people
who are aware of the scope and mandate of this office and who have trust in
the organisation. A proactive educational role, a demonstrative effect of its
reach accompanied by selection of the right persons to the job can make it
work.
Seventh is the Federal Election Commission. A powerful, independent
and assertive FEC can play a preventive role by careful screening, scrutiny
and investigation of the candidates for all tiers of elected offices and
disqualifying those who are ill reputed and of dubious character. They should
forcefully enforce the criteria prescribed under the Constitution augmented
by appropriate rules and regulations. This fundamental shift in the quality of
our elected public officials would bring about a significant change in the
overall structure of governance in the country.
Eighth is the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). The law
establishing the Bureau was quite a significant measure in holding to
account the corrupt and those who derive personal gains from public office.
But the implementation of the law was selective and the Bureau soon lost its
credibility and moral authority. The recent move to place the Bureau under
the Ministry of Law is a step in the wrong direction. The Bureau or its
successor organisation should be given complete operational and financial
autonomy and protected from political interference. It is the fear of the
Bureau that should act as a deterrent.
How can these Institutions of Restraint be Strengthened?
There are certain pre-conditions under which these institutions of
restraint can be strengthened. First, a system of checks and balances can
flourish only if various countervailing forces such as the parliament,
judiciary, media and the civil society organisations are allowed to play an
independent role. There should be no presumption that any one entity
whether it is the executive or the judiciary or the media or civil society
will enjoy monopoly power or act as a self-righteous body of vigilance. It
is the interaction of these various entities and balance between them
which will generate the optimal results. Second, no new institutions are
being proposed but only the revitalisation, revamping and re-
180engineering of those already in existence under the constitution is being
suggested. There is a common tendency and an easy way out for both
national government and international donors to abandon the existing
institutions and create new agencies which start out with a big bang but
soon fall prey to the same whirlpool of inaction and ineptitude. The
reasons for failure are the same as those which explain the non-
performance of existing institutions. Unless the underlying dynamics is set
right the institutional morass will grow. The history of Pakistan is laden
with the creation of a plethora of new institutions which have been given
blurred mandates, inadequate resources, little operational autonomy
and are never held accountable for results.
Finally, this proposal does not favour the periodic, swift, abrupt,
highly visible and publicised, extra-institutional measures against
recalcitrant officials which have been the norm in Pakistan since the 1958
screening of senior civil servants under Ayub Khan. The subsequent
actions by successive governments resorting to the purge of 303 or 1500
civil servants paradoxically created greater insecurity, uncertainty and
unpredictability which are the breeding grounds for increased
corruption.
The approach advocated here is to create an environment whereby
the acts of misdemeanour and malfeasance are exposed routinely, increased
vigilance and scrutiny is exercised continuously, early detection,
investigation and fixing of responsibility are carried out resolutely and
disciplinary actions against those found guilty are taken promptly. Such an
environment would act as a more effective deterrent in curbing corrupt
practices than creating many laws and anti-corruption agencies with
enormous powers which are misused. This approach will not work if the
federal and provincial investigation agencies are not organised on modern
and professional lines. It will also be difficult to implement it if the
government does not do away with the widespread and mindless application
of the Official Secrets Act which has encouraged opacity of decision-making
by politicians and civil servants. Outside the matters of national defence
and internal security, all decisions—particularly in matters of public
finance, foreign trade, contract awards and allocation of other public
resources—should be wholly transparent and made public liberally
under the Freedom of Information Act.
181These eight pillars of good governance can together make the
difference, provided (a) they are headed by widely respected, strong and
competent managers of known integrity (we have many of them in the
country); (b) the terms of reference, responsibilities, functions and
powers of these institutions are clearly defined; (c) there is no political
interference in their working but at the same time they are held publicly
accountable for their actions and the results; (d) they are providing
adequate financial resources and professional staff of calibre; (e) they
follow open and transparent procedures and processes. To ensure non-
partisan political support for these institutions their heads should be
confirmed by the Parliamentary Committees. In this way, the changes in
the government will not disrupt their smooth functioning.
Together, these eight pillars, if allowed to work effectively, will be able
to plug in some of the conduits that lead to corrupt practices. The most
difficult question to answer is: Who will bell the cat? Who has the courage
to put these changes in place? Of course, an enlightened government that
has a sense of history rather than sights fixed on the next election. Pakistan
has not been fortunate in having such a government so far.


### Conclusion

The story of Pakistan provides ample confirmation of the validity of theoretical literature and empirical evidence about governance in developing countries. The distinctive characteristics that dominate the Pakistani scene, are the elitist capture of the state, excessive
centralisation of power by both the elected and military rulers, chronic
political instability and until recently collusion between the power
structures—the politicians, the Army and the judiciary. The conflicts
that took place at times between these power structures were not
rooted in benign balancing acts for the larger collective good of the
society but assertion of the authority by different actors to advance their
narrow interests.

Unlike other societies, the cost Pakistan had to pay for poor governance and institutional decay has been very high. The path ahead is clearly defined. The agenda for reforms has to be carved
out in the light of historical experience, internationally established best
practices and the various characteristics peculiar to the Pakistani situation.
This can form a logical sequence to the Eighteenth Constitutional
182Amendment and the National Finance Commission Award of 2010. There is
an urgent need to realise that only taking this reform agenda to its
culmination point over the next five years can complete the value chain.
