Over the last two decades Pakistan has had the resilience to survive against all odds. How can it succeed is the main topic of this chapter. 

Despite its many challenges, during this period, Pakistan has grown at an average rate of over five per cent. As a country with a population of 175 million people today, it is important to understand that 99 per cent of the fabric of a diverse and rich culture and people can and do make a
difference. 

Pakistan remains open for business despite the enormous challenges it confronts. Whilst international media and policy think tanks focus on how to tackle militancy and extremism, the vast majority of the people who live and work in Pakistan today say openly that this minority
does not represent them as a people and ask why the international media
cannot recognise the simple fact that every Pakistani is not a militant or
extremist.

During 2010 Aisam ul Haq Qureishi became the first Pakistani to
reach the US Open doubles final. After losing the final, he addressed a
15,000 strong gathering at the Arthur Ashe Stadium with millions of
people watching across the world. He said, 'I want to say something on
behalf of all Pakistanis. Every time I come here, there's a wrong perception
about the people of Pakistan. They are very friendly, very loving people.
We want peace in this world as much as you.' The crowd cheered and the
hearts of Pakistani citizens around the world warmed to his remarks of
respect for its people. In many ways, this thirty-year old was able to
capture for a moment what the Pakistani diplomatic community has failed
to achieve—to project Pakistan in its true light. The point is that
215stimulating economic growth in a country requires investment, which in
turn requires market access to capital investment. Pakistan's market access
is severely compromised by its negative perception. Addressing this
problem head on has to remain a priority for all stakeholders.
That said, Pakistan's future outlook and its strong underlying
fundamentals mean that it is difficult for investors to ignore the
opportunities it has to offer. What is even more important as the process
of institutional re-building gains momentum, is the gradual yet distinct
realisation by all stakeholders that having a clear Pakistan game plan for
success is essential and sticking to the script has to be part of the game
plan. If the goal is to realise Pakistan's full potential, then putting the house
in order is a fundamental pre-requisite for the success story to unfold at a
time when most critics argue otherwise.

One example of such an adversity is the catastrophic floods in
Pakistan in the summer of 2010—the worst natural disaster in the
country's history. These have resulted in a colossal setback to its economy.
The extensive damage to infrastructure will mean years of rebuilding, and
the mass displacement of people will require the rehabilitation of millions
across the country. All of this will need an extraordinary amount of
resources, thus compounding Pakistan's economic woes and exacerbating
long-standing challenges. Among these challenges are macroeconomic
instability, an inadequate infrastructure to support business activity, poor
social indicators, a deep governance deficit and limited integration into the
global economy at a time when competition from China, India and other
regional countries grows in key export sectors including textiles.
With the world still dealing with global recession and the country
struggling with the aftermath of floods, sceptics suggest that Pakistan is
today less able to handle such shocks than it was ten or twenty years ago.
They argue that Pakistan's economic future is at best perilous given
decades of political instability and economic mismanagement and that it
is far down on the list of global capital-seeking-investment. Against this
backdrop, addressing structural challenges acquires a sense of urgency
and priority at all levels of government, industry and businesses. To
achieve a sustainable rebound, policy priorities must be set clearly to meet
the needs of reconstruction and deal with critical economic, social and
political issues in the face of fierce competition, shrinking global demand
216and increasing geo-political risk. Now more than ever, it is imperative to
identify what Pakistan needs to do to become more competitive and be
among the winners in the coming decades.
This chapter is an attempt to challenge the view of the sceptics. By
focusing on the most critical policy measures needed to achieve
competitiveness, Pakistan has the ability to capture the energy and
dynamism of its natural advantages, accelerate growth and 'catch up' on
the global economic stage.


### Pakistan's Potential

In 2005 Goldman Sachs formulated the notion of the Next-11 (N-11) as a
group of countries that have the economic potential to become important
players in the global system after the so-called BRIC, an acronym for
Brazil, Russia, India and China. The N-11 though diverse in many ways
was identified as rapidly developing economies with the ability to match,
if not eventually overtake, the Group of Seven (G-7) countries. The main
criterion was demographic—with the result that the N-11 is a group of
large population countries beyond BRIC. Pakistan was identified as one
among these countries owing to its size, its growing population, and its
industrial base. All these factors give Pakistan an ability to produce
consumer goods and have a substantial domestic market with the capacity
to consume them.

The following are some of Pakistan's main advantages, fundamental
to its long-term growth. Not surprisingly, some of these are similar to
those that are propelling growth and attracting global investment flows to
the rapidly developing Asian economies in the region including China and
India.

A resilient economy. First, despite seven changes in government in
the past twenty years, Pakistan has maintained an average growth rate of 5
per cent per annum. Until recently, Pakistan was being touted as one of
the most dramatic turnaround stories of the last decade. Driven by
domestic demand and population growth, GDP growth averaged over 6
per cent a year from 2003–2008. This translated into an investment and
infrastructure-led growth cycle fuelling expansion in the housing, health
care, education, food, infrastructure, energy, telecommunications, IT and
financial services sectors. This has meant that Pakistan's economy has
217progressively moved from its traditional agricultural base to
manufacturing and increasingly to services. In that sense, Pakistan's
economic structure is much closer to that of India and China, and is unlike
many smaller Asian countries, which are more dependent on export
growth.

Official IMF estimates of the country's per capita income are US$1,200, which, on a Purchasing Power Parity basis, is US$2,500. 

Additional estimates suggest about twenty-five to thirty million people, or
one sixth of Pakistan's population, have a per capita income on a PPP basis
of between US$8,000 to US$10,000. Part of the growth is accounted for
by a large and vibrant informal economy which is estimated to be at least
30 to 50 per cent of the size of the formal economy and which is growing
as much as 13 per cent per annum. Pakistan's thriving informal economy
is not documented and consists of a vast network of smugglers, traders
and agriculturalists. The energy and dynamism of the informal economy
has, in part, been responsible for continued growth. With better
documentation, this has the prospects of being channelled into formal
sectors. This can help to raise tax collection and attract investment capital
to roll out much needed capacity in healthcare, education, law and order
and energy sectors. This will not only have a direct impact on alleviating
poverty but also allow the productive economic bc1se to expand in a
sustained manner.

Over the last two decades, Pakistan has undergone meaningful
banking sector, tax and corporate governance reforms and has a solid
financial system. Its economy is more open to trade and investment
compared to countries at a similar stage of development. Pakistan's
English-speaking professional elite, a well-developed legal system based on
English common law and a significant pool of overseas Pakistanis have
allowed a reasonable degree of integration with the global economy.
Pakistan's business community has historically been westward looking
and has also developed strong links to the Middle East and Asian
economies and China. Today, over 300 foreign multinationals have well
established business operations in Pakistan. The US, European Union and
Japan remain the three largest foreign direct investors with new inflows
emanating from the Middle East and China. Other key indicators suggest
a positive growth trend—foreign remittances hit around $9 billion in 2010
218up from $984 million in 2000, foreign exchange reserves were around $16
billion in June 2010 up from $1.7 billion in 2000 and exports were $20
billion in 2010 up from $8 billion in 2000.
This resilience has also been demonstrated in key capital market
indicators. In 2009, Pakistan's KSEl00 index surged over 60 per cent in a year.
Pakistan was wracked by increased violence and many of its state institutions
were overwhelmed by security challenges. From 1998-2010, there has been
an enormous increase of over 700 per cent in the KSE100 after accounting
for rupee depreciation.6 This makes Pakistan the best performing market in a
twelve-year period and significantly better than the BRIC economies.
Pakistan's stock market capitalisation to GDP (PPP basis) ratio is
approximately 7 per cent. This is very low compared to the BRIC economies,
where market capitalisation to GDP ratio ranges from 25 per cent in Russia
to 60 per cent in Brazil. This ratio is a measure of the extent of development
of a country's capital market and of the valuation of its listed assets relative to
the overall size of the economy. More developed economies like Hong Kong
tend to have ratios in excess of 100 per cent. This highlights the
comparatively low valuations for Pakistan relative to the BRIC economies.
These low valuations in turn reflect the extent of investor pessimism as well
as potential upside for investors if Pakistan's growth begins to surge.
Withstanding geo-political risk. Second, Pakistan has been the victim
of two major international events in the last three decades. The Russian
invasion of Afghanistan resulted in a war that saw the influx of 3.5 million
refugees and led to the rise of militancy in the region. The US-led invasion of
Afghanistan after 9/11 compounded Pakistan's security challenges which
dealt heavy blows to its economy. In the current security situation, it has been
difficult to attract foreign and mobilise domestic investment. Pakistan has not
been given a preferred status for exports to the United States or the European
Union, which are Pakistan's main export markets. As a consequence of geo-
political risks, Pakistan is not seen as a friendly investment destination.
Despite this, Pakistan's investment to GDP ratio has averaged 17 per cent for
the last decade and is 17 per cent today after reaching a peak of 23 per cent in
2007. In many ways, Pakistan's corporate leaders and professionals as
amongst the most 'battle hardened' pool of managerial talent in the world with
the ability to manage risk and still show growth under the most challenging
business conditions.
Demographic asset. Third, with a population of 175 million people,
219almost a quarter the size of Europe's population, Pakistan is the sixth most
populous country in the world. This has resulted in rapid growth in
urbanisation, which presents opportunities as well as challenges. With a
large and expanding workforce and relatively few people in the dependent
age bracket of under fifteen and over sixty-four, Pakistan is ideally
positioned to reap the demographic dividend.
While Pakistan's young population of around a hundred million is
already becoming an engine of growth, its youth can become the back­
bone of its middle class that can, in turn, drive economic growth. This
offers Pakistani businesses an opportunity to grow and produce goods and
services the population needs. At a time when the Western world is facing
the crisis of ageing populations, Pakistan has the potential for economic
expansion created by a young population provided, of course, that it can
be educated and empowered with the right skills.
Natural Resources. Fourth, Pakistan's landmass, equal to that of
Brazil's, is rich in natural resources, including mineral wealth and arable land.
It is the world's fourth largest cotton producer and its coal reserves—the
fourth largest in the world—are estimated around 186 billion tons, which in
terms of energy output is at least equal to if not more than the oil reserves
of Saudi Arabia. Balochistan has one of the largest copper reserves in the
world estimated at eighteen million tons of copper and thirty-five million
ounces of residual gold. Pakistan is the world's fifth largest dairy producer
and increasing its exports of both milk and beef to the Middle East in addition
to meeting domestic needs.
Strategic location. Fifth, Pakistan's location gives it a unique
advantage. Although location is currently responsible for much of its
negative image, this can be turned around. As the economic centre of
gravity shifts to Asia it is situated at the crossroads of opportunity: large
energy resources and one of the largest pools of liquidity in the world. For
large parts of western China, Afghanistan and the Central Asian
Republics, the shortest and cheapest trade route is through Pakistan. The
government has been capitalising on this by creating a strategic trade and
energy corridor. A major new port in Gawadar has been completed and
the Singapore Port Authority has the mandate to manage it. There is a
network of highways linking China and Central Asia to the port city of
Gawadar. This is an important long term growth opportunity offered by
220Pakistan and has recently been reinforced by the Pakistan Afghan Transit
Trade Agreement (PATTA) signed in 2010 allowing the opening up of trade
through Pakistan to Afghanistan and beyond.
To summarise, Pakistan's resilience in the face of problems and its
strong fundamentals give it the potential to turn into an economic success
story. But it will have to surmount formidable challenges in order to do so. To
capitalise on its advantages Pakistan needs to grow by 7–8 per cent per annum
for the next ten years; 1 per cent growth in GDP requires a 2.5 to 3 per cent
growth in the investment rate. Therefore GDP growth rate of 7 per cent will
require annual investment rates of over 21 per cent as a percentage of GDP.
Given Pakistan's weak social, political and economic infrastructure, can
Pakistan achieve the required investment to turn the economic corner, grow
and compete globally? So the question is—what needs to be done for
Pakistan to attain competitiveness and create national wealth?
Where Does Pakistan Stand Globally?
Any country that wants to succeed in the global economy needs to closely
study competition, not to mimic but to understand how other countries have
identified what works for them and how to benchmark themselves with what
others do globally. The table below is from the Global Competitiveness
Report, a survey conducted annually by the World Economic Forum. It is a
useful tool summarising the factors on which the competitiveness of 133
countries are assessed on a relative scale. Based on the twelve pillars of
assessment, Pakistan ranks 101 out of 113 countries in the 2009-2010 survey.
This shines a light on the areas where Pakistan has to work to achieve greater
competitiveness.
What Does Pakistan Need to do to Become Competitive?
Improving the competitiveness of any country is not easy and Pakistan
is no exception. But its potential can be achieved if a clear roadmap is
developed. This will require not just fresh ideas, public-private partnerships and
foreign investment but also improving the infrastructure, developing its
human capital and funding critical new technologies. A plan to achieve this
will need the following:
Clear vision. First, Pakistan needs a coherent vision and strategy.
Attaining competitiveness is synonymous with creating national wealth.
221Owing to its geography and demography, Pakistani industry and business
have the ability to become more competitive for its own domestic market
and compete regionally and globally, if they act in a structured and
collective manner. Experts in the field have increasingly started citing
South Asia as the fastest growing region in the world. While this
conclusion is driven by India's nascent economic strength, which in turn
is premised on India's fast growing middle class, educated population base
and stable politics, it is important to recognise that Pakistan possesses
similar characteristics and potential.
There are some key problems in evolving a clear vision. There is lack
of consensus about what this vision should be. This stems from a
psychological barrier in the minds of Pakistan's public and private sector
players that Pakistan cannot be globally competitive. Overwhelmed by
current challenges, there is little appreciation of the economic opportunity
that the country presents and how to unlock this value.
Also activity across government departments and agencies is not
coordinated in pursuit of the goal of attaining competitiveness. There is,
for example, lack of alignment between the government's social policies,
especially education, and its economic, foreign and defence policies.
Furthermore, policy inconsistencies between successive governments
have left little room for the private sector to innovate and generate fresh
ideas. This lack of coordination is exacerbated by an over-reliance on
foreign assistance and policy prescriptions from multilateral agencies.

Percent of responses
Note: From a list of 15 factors, respondents were asked to select the five most problematic for doing business in their country/economy and to rank
them between 1 (most problematic) and 5. The bars in the figure show the responses weighted according to their rankings.

What can be done? Sustainability, environmentally conscious,
inclusive growth from the bottom up and global competitiveness are all
interconnected. Yet, much of the thinking and work being done today is
not looking at the inclusive approach for growth. Policy-makers are
thinking in pieces as unique problems that can be addressed separately. The
overall economic, political and social canvas needs to be addressed in a
coordinated fashion for Pakistan to take advantage of its growth
opportunity. There are four key areas where action should be taken.
First, the private sector should help generate a national debate on the
need to develop a shared mindset across government, industry, the media
and other key stakeholders to attain competitiveness. This will serve as a
signal not only to the international community but also to the country's
public sector administration, business community and labour force that
Pakistan is serious about competing.
Second, the government should be willing to pull all the levers at its
disposal to implement such vision. This involves creating an environment
that gives foreign and domestic companies a reason to invest and stay in
Pakistan. This in turn could be achieved through a realignment of tax and
investment policies, especially in sectors where investment is a critical
precursor to long-term structural change.
Third, a global media campaign targeted at international as well as
domestic investors should, be launched, highlighting the trade and
investment opportunities in Pakistan and the government's agenda of
reform.

Fourth, the government's social and economic policies including
education, transport, infrastructure, energy and communications must be
aligned with this vision. This coordinated approach should extend to
Pakistan's defence and foreign policies, which should also reflect
Pakistan's aspirations of rapid economic progress.
Improve Governance. The problems of governance stem from the
inability of governments and public sector institutions to deliver public
services in the face of rising demands and expectations.
As this is discussed elsewhere in this volume it is sufficient to
emphasise that without improved governance, delivery systems and
effective implementation, Pakistan will find it difficult to educate its
224citizens, build infrastructure, increase agricultural output and ensure that
the benefits of economic growth are efficiently distributed.
Improve infrastructure. Pakistan's infrastructure constraints are
evident in the present power crisis, lack of a modern railroad system,
shortage of low—to middle—income housing, congestion on urban roads
and main highway systems and an inadequate port capacity. There is
grossly inadequate primary, secondary and higher education and
healthcare facilities. Pakistani companies suffer as a consequence of these
factors, for example, by experiencing production delays in exports due to
limited port capacity and cumbersome customs procedures. The lack of
availability of a well-trained, healthy and productive work force further
inhibits business potential. In addition, poor logistics and transportation
also hamper the movement of inventory between farm and market or
factory and market.
If Pakistan's growth continues at an average rate of 7-8 per cent in
the coming decade, this will fuel the demand for energy, transport,
logistics, communication, healthcare, housing, water, education and
communication. Urbanisation is also increasing. Almost a third of the
population now lives in four major urban centres. A 2 per cent in-
migration rate means that this number will grow by over half in the next
twenty-five years. These unprecedented levels of urbanisation present
challenges but can also bring opportunities as vast numbers of people can
have access to information, services, communication facilities as well as
standards of living which do not exist in the rural areas. Official estimates
of new infrastructure requirements in terms of ports, railroads, hospitals,
schools, low income housing and energy are approximately $30 billion in
the next five years just to sustain current levels of growth.
So there is a dual problem: the current infrastructure is inadequate
and future growth is burdened by lack of resources and poor planning.
Obvious examples include: the current energy shortage, which is the
consequence of neglect of the power sector by successive governments, and
the shortage of trained technical staff and engineers—impediments to any
rapid infrastructure roll out. Lastly future growth is hampered by the
challenges of security. Building dams in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, mining coal
in Baluchistan or establishing a modern port capacity on the southern
coastline are all dependent on the security of human capital.
225What can be done? First and foremost, Pakistan needs to resolve its
financing issues, Pakistan needs to further develop its capital markets as
well as create market access for long term foreign capital inflows. A
vibrant and liquid corporate bond market, the ability to source fresh equity
from the domestic and international equity markets, deregulation of the
insurance and pensions markets, and a stable banking system are all areas
for greater focus. Previous governments have achieved some measure of
success in this regard to the extent that the country was able to tap
international markets for debt and also improve its international credit
rating. Pakistan has also set up the Infrastructure Project Development
Facility (IPDF) that needs to be better utilised to bring about more robust
public-private partnerships in energy, health care, transportation,
agriculture and education.
It is also important to focus on infrastructure projects, which can be
more easily delivered by a combination of government initiatives, foreign
assistance or domestic private investment. Examples include projects for
low-income housing, a modern irrigation system, high yield crops and
development of human capital with particular focus on skills needed to
help existing and new industries grow.

Becoming the region's food reservoir. Even though the setback
from the floods may in the near term affect Pakistan's ability to feed itself,
a country that has been self-sufficient in food should be able to effect a
recovery. The country's major agricultural products include cotton, wheat,
rice, sugarcane, fruits and vegetables while its livestock and dairy
resources provide ample milk, beef, mutton and eggs. It is, however,
essential for Pakistan to improve its agricultural output levels and
productivity. Agriculture generates around 22 per cent of the GDP while
employing 45 per cent of the labour force. Almost two thirds of the
population is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood—hence
changing the complexion of the agricultural sector through a focused
investment drive would help to radically change the complexion of
Pakistan's economy.
Over the past twenty years land under cultivation has remained
relatively static and yields per hectare have only improved marginally.
Intensive farming and environmental degradation have resulted in soil
erosion. These factors will continue to impede agricultural growth as
urbanisation results in a loss of arable land.
226To enable Pakistan to become the granary of the region, not only
productivity, but also scale, quality, continuity and reliability of agri-food
production needs to be ensured. The world's largest distributors of food in
the region, which include Wal-Mart, Nestle, Unilever, Metro, Sears,
Carrefour and Spinney can then be persuaded to increase investment in
downstream production which feed agri food businesses in the region.
Investment, particularly in better seeds and new technology, is required to
raise yields.
Second, agriculture needs to be deregulated to allow greater degree of
commercialisation and economies of scale. Eliminating price controls,
restrictions on inter-provincial movement of goods and strict curbs on
smuggling of food products to neighbouring countries will allow greater
flexibility to farmers to sell directly to the organised retail sector.
Third, a comprehensive national agricultural policy needs to be evolved
to offer incentives to indigenous and foreign investors. To promote
sustainable R&D in the sector, that policy should encourage joint ventures
between global and local companies. In particular, large local landowners
should be encouraged to forge alliances to enable 'contract farming' which
invites expertise, technology and finance with an enhanced regional market
focus to boost both production and productivity. However, the current system
of land holdings, price controls and lack of legal enforceability may inhibit
the entry of new players, technology and expertise into Pakistan. To
overcome such obstacles, a combination of removal of subsidies and
public sector investment could act as a catalyst for growth.
Fourth, due to the small size of farm holdings, there should be a
comprehensive programme of education for farmers at the basic level
about better agricultural practices, information and availability of better
seeds, use of fertiliser and crop patterns. The village farmer is the key to
increased agricultural productivity.
Raise education standards. Pakistan's abysmal literacy figures need
to be frontally attacked by a national policy. This is discussed in the next
chapter.
Build a skilled work force. Reaping the demographic dividend will
depend on having a skilled workforce. The present size of approximately
fifty-five million people means that Pakistan's labour force is the ninth
largest in the world, and growing by at least two to three million workers
227a year. In addition to education initiatives, it is critical to unleash a parallel
effort aimed at bridging the skills gap.
There are several problems here. First, the skills needed for low-paid
agricultural jobs are very different from the skills needed for higher­ paid
jobs such as in healthcare, plumbing or construction. While vocational
training centres have been established in different parts of the country,
there is insufficient effort to identify and provide the skills that are
needed. Second, the higher education institutes that produce doctors,
engineers and business graduates are not numerous enough to churn out
enough trained professionals. Some studies have shown that there is an
exodus of trained manpower nearly the size of fresh incoming graduates
particularly in the field of engineering. These trends are alarming and need
to be reversed.
This means first, a list of skills that are required across sectors should
be developed. Some of these skills may be common but others may be sector
specific. In this regard, the government sponsored National Vocational and
Technical Education Commission (NAVTEC) can be used to upscale its
programs to give technical and vocational training a quantum jump and
ensure that standards of attainment improve.
Second, a public-private partnership should be set up by the Ministry
of Technology to bring together all the technical manpower resources in
the country and use this as a pool to harness technology, expertise and
ideas. These can then be commercially applied in areas and sectors in
which Pakistan ought to focus to achieve competitive strength. Such a pool
can also be applied to build the capacity of highly skilled technical managers
needed to produce and disseminate high­ middle- and low-end technologies
and products.
One area where highly and technically skilled manpower exists is in
the Pakistan Armed Forces. This 'hidden' talent reserve has a demonstrated
ability to absorb and learn the use of new technologies. This resource
ought to be leveraged by the private sector to 'leap-frog'. Corporate leaders
could join hands with leading technology experts in the Armed Forces in
a joint effort to identify those areas that could provide the basis for export
driven growth in areas where the industrial sector can be transformed. A
case in point is Brazil where government policy has over the last three
decades helped to make Brazil among the largest exporters of defence
228technologies and equipment by combining techno­ logical expertise in their
domestic auto sector with defence expertise.
It is important for Pakistan to align its labour market policy with a
sound policy for competitiveness in industry, agriculture and the service
sector. One initiative that attempts to identify indicators on skills and wages
using labour market force data is the Pakistan Employment Trends Report
produced by the Ministry of Labour and Manpower in collaboration with the
International Labour Organisation (ILO). More specifically the report has
looked at the technical and vocational training capacity in the country and
how this can improve competitiveness. The key message here is greater
investment in education and training, particularly for young people and
women.
While government and private sector initiatives are focusing on
upgrading the infrastructure in both these areas, much more needs to be
done to create alignment between those industries and sectors which are
being targeted for export growth and the skills and education levels which
are required for people entering the labour market to be employed at levels
which allow them to climb the income curve.
Boost exports. Pakistan has never had a consistent, coherent and
well­ articulated export-focused growth strategy. Indeed, exports are often
treated as a residual after-thought once the domestic market has been
catered for. This is inexplicable given that the country has had a
persistently large trade deficit, which has been increasingly difficult to
finance each year. While exports have been rising, economic growth, per
se, has never been driven by exports. Nor has building a dynamic export
sector been at the forefront of any government's economic strategy.
Although domestic demand has to remain an important cornerstone of the
overall growth story and firms have to be competitive domestically to survive,
the focus of policy has to shift from being inward looking to one which is
outward looking, focused more on export growth than just on domestic
demand.
Comparison with other countries reinforce the lesson that trade
openness has been an important factor in driving economic growth in
successful countries. Openness has helped economic transformation. Aside
from the benefits of having a more competitive environment, which induces
firms to become more efficient, unblocking the access to export markets that
229were not accessible before also provides opportunities for economies of scale
in industrial production.
Pakistan's export to GDP ratio is relatively low and its exports per
capita are among the lowest when compared to other Asian economies. If one
looks at the export mix, it is apparent that sectors that are low technology and
low value are the ones that have grown. Broadly speaking exports fall into
two categories: textiles and other Small and Medium Enterprise (SME)
industries across different sectors such as leather, chemical, medical goods
and agricultural products.
The challenge for Pakistan is to diversify this portfolio by
implementing policies that contribute to successfully exporting new and more
sophisticated products both within textiles and the SME sectors. A closer look
at textiles and SMEs is telling.
Transform textiles. Pakistan is the fourth largest producer and the third
largest consumer of cotton in the world. The downstream textile and garments
sector, considered to be low value addition, has grown the most and today this
sector represents the single largest industrial sector. It employs approximately
38 per cent of the total manufacturing labour force, supports about 1.5 million
farmers and contributes about 9 per cent to the country's GDP. It is also
consistently responsible for between 50 and 70 per cent of the country's
exports. During the past several decades, textiles have attracted the highest
share of total capital investment.
Significant progress has been made by an increase in upstream cotton
cultivation and the downstream industry has developed from being a fabric
producer and yarn exporter to exporting products with a higher value added
content. Problems however remain. Cotton yields lag behind those of
competing countries, irrigation methods are antiquated, and cotton picking,
storage and transportation facilities continue to be poor resulting in
contamination of cotton. The cotton produced remains of low quality, which
restricts the types of products that can be made from it.
This is evidenced by the value added sector where Pakistan has visibly
slid down the value chain with gains in the low value added sectors and
setbacks in the higher value added segments. Globally, Pakistan's value added
segments find it hard to compete effectively with goods from China, India,
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. This is further compounded by a poor policy
framework, political turmoil, and the high cost of energy and transport.
Despite the existence of a Ministry of Textiles, problems are faced by
producers due to the shortage of qualified, skilled labour, absence of research
230and development, weak marketing capabilities and a general apathy to address
problems proactively at the official level.
This situation needs to be urgently addressed. As a core industry Pakistan's
textiles have the ability to transform its economic future. The sector has been
mismanaged and misunderstood for decades. Pakistan's natural advantage as a
cotton producing country has thus been undermined while nations like
Bangladesh, China, India, and Sri Lanka have been able to lower costs, attain
higher exports and capture world market share without cotton-growing being the
backbone of their economies. While some of the large Pakistani business groups
have emerged amongst the most competitive textile producers in the world, this
is not true for the textile sector as a whole, which remains fragmented. The more
successful groups are those that are vertically integrated and have successfully
positioned themselves in foreign markets, earning a significant percentage of their
export revenues from value added products.
The key to transforming the textile industry is to add value to cotton by
better organisation and coordination from cotton ginning to the finished
product which can add a new edge to the sector's competitiveness. This could
involve policies to support the import of plant and machinery, access to
favourable financing terms, support to cotton growers, incentives for proper
transportation and logistics and greater focus on penetrating export markets.
This would assist producers to get to the finished goods stage with greater ease
and allow greater economies of scale to develop.
A hypothetical example to demonstrate the payback of value addition
is as follows. If Pakistan were to utilise its cotton to produce high-quality
shirts and trousers its exports could surge. Pakistan produces twelve million
bales of cotton each year. Each bale contains 480 pounds of cotton. The
production of one shirt and trouser combined consumes approximately
two pounds of cotton. If Pakistan produced nothing but shirts and trousers,
and sold one trouser and one shirt collectively for $25 in the international
market, then, Pakistan could earn $72 billion in export earnings each year.
Pakistan's current textile and apparel exports are $10 billion. A textile
strategy which encourages value addition, could therefore transform
Pakistan's economic landscape.
One step in the right direction has been the introduction of the new
National Textile Policy 2009-2014 announced by the Ministry of Textiles
in 2009. This establishes an investment fund that aims at incentivising
investments in specific areas including modernisation of machinery and
231technology, removing infrastructural bottlenecks, enhancing skills, better
marketing and use of information and communication technology. The
fund provides generous sector-specific and general rebates, re-financing
schemes and grants. That said, such a policy falls short on implementation,
as it has not resulted in the level of capital investment required to grow
value added textiles to the level where they can start to make a meaningful
contribution across the board for the economy as a whole.
SME Sector. Often the official pre-occupation with the textile sector
blindsides the government to other 'value added' exports in the SME
sector. Whilst textile exports traditionally account for as much as 70 per
cent of annual exports, remaining exports include SME sectors including
food, petroleum products, leather, pharmaceuticals, engineering goods,
cement, sports goods, carpets, surgical equipment, furniture, gems and
jewellery. Most of these sectors are high value added, high margin and
have a higher demand propensity in export markets. The key hurdle is that
they account for a smaller percentage of Pakistan's total exports and hence
command little attention from government policy-makers.
SME manufacturing enterprises generate 35 per cent of Pakistan's
manufacturing output, 85 per cent employment for non-agricultural labour
and 25 per cent of exports. These are impressive statistics, yet they remain
in the backwater of mainstream economic policy. What is urgently needed
is a sustained and vigorous policy-driven growth in these sectors with
strong forward and backward inter-industry linkages using the 'inclusive'
growth model. With labour-input, a large component of capital and
output, rapid SME growth can have a salutary impact on wages,
employment, living standards and alleviating poverty.
Much needs to be done to achieve this outcome. The government
has large bureaucracies dealing with SME in all provinces but it is unclear
what they do. Surveys of activity in this sector are undertaken, sometimes
as infrequently as fifteen years, and a rather imprecise growth rate is
calculated. This figure is then put into the National Income Accounts and
repeated year-after-year until the next survey. The growth rate of the SME
sector has been determined to be as low as 2.5 per cent per annum and has
averaged between 7.5 per cent and 7.8 per cent per annum for the last five
years. This is not the true rate of growth of the SME sector; rather it is a
'plug in' number, which economic managers use, in the GDP economic
232model. In Pakistan's National Accounts, the SME growth rate and that of
large scale manufacturing together combine to yield the total
manufacturing sector growth. Perhaps with more accurate documentation,
it would be possible to generate a more accurate assessment of growth
rates for SME. So what is first needed is more and better information on
what is going on in the SME sector from which most exports emanate.
Second, growth in these SME sectors can be enhanced by technology
inputs, trained labour and manufacturing or service capacity to scale up
production as well as the marketing expertise in order to penetrate global
markets. This can create a virtuous cycle of growth, employment creation,
learning about new products and development.
Second, the incentive structure needs to favour exports through
judicious adjustment in trade, tax, finance and tariff policies. Special
incentives should be given to exporters. If this 'tilt' is sustained, new
exports can surge. An examination of the rather non-descript category of
'Miscellaneous Exports' in the official export data turns up some surprising
high-value items that Pakistan exports to some very sophisticated markets
but the amounts are small and their year-on-year growth is fairly erratic.
Third, the non-price determinants of exports need to be strengthened
by emulating 'best-practice' techniques employed by the world's leading
exporters.
Fourth, domestic and FDJ proposals that are aimed at exports should
be given the highest priority and placed on a fast track for approval. FDI
inflows offer the best route to securing discrete upward shifts in the
technological progress function in the SME sector, simultaneously bringing
in better managerial and marketing skills critical for exports.
Fifth, at the firm level, companies have to find a uniquely Pakistani way
to develop a game plan for themselves. To be successful, Pakistani firms have
to build market shares in sectors where they have the ability to produce better
and cheaper goods for international markets.

### The Importance of Harnessing Entrepreneurial Talent for SME
Development

According to the MIT Entrepreneurship Centre at MIT Sloan School, it
is imperative for rapidly developing economies to review the importance of supporting entrepreneurship as an urgent matter of public policy. In a similar vein, an Economist Intelligence Report emphasised the importance of government investment in education and Research and Development by
highlighting that 'waves of technically trained young people—steeped in the
latest theories and techniques, and honed by some of the smartest minds in
science and technology—do more to raise a country's industrial
competitiveness than all the tax breaks, development aid and government
initiatives put together'.

Pakistan's SME Development Vision as spelled out by the SME policy
is 'SME-led economic growth resulting in poverty reduction, creation of jobs
and unleashing the entrepreneurial potential of the people of Pakistan'. The
SME policy has a vast institutional network consisting of institutions like the
Small and Medium Enterprise Authority (SMEDA), the National Productivity
Organisation, the Pakistan Software Export Board (PSEB) and the
Competitiveness Support Fund. Whilst these organisations have developed a
great deal of capacity and can launch a number of high impact programs to
encourage entrepreneurship, much more needs to be done in terms of
coordination, impact and results.

One of the main concerns is that growth of small and medium sized
businesses is still constrained due to limited access to financing, bureaucracy,
and the absence of a skilled worked force with the tool kit for setting up a
successful small business. Wherever such initiatives are underway, they suffer
from limited funding, uneven and insufficient government support and lack of
coordination. If properly harnessed, small enterprises have the ability to
increase the per capita income to a level of US $10,000 in the next ten years.
Whilst an institutional network exists, some of the key initiatives
that need further capacity and focus are as follows. First, set up and fund
training programs for small businesses in vocational schools and
universities in urban and major rural areas. Second, banks should ensure
adequate funding for small enterprises, which is based on cash flow
lending versus asset-based models. Third, the government should fund an
early stage equity fund to provide seed capital for early stage start-up
ventures where the fund is managed on a private enterprise basis which
could be sector specific such as high growth information technology,
human development, agriculture, services, and industry. Fourth, efforts
should be directed to encourage ideas, progress and innovation through
the formation of clusters. Clusters inherently evolve because of
234entrepreneurship. For example, the technology cluster in Pakistan is
Lahore and the textile cluster in Pakistan is Faisalabad and Karachi. Most
successful businesses in Pakistan are founded by entrepreneurs who are
located in a particular area; the cluster forms around these entrepreneurs.
Therefore, focusing on entrepreneurship in clusters can have a significant
impact, which reinforces the idea of an inclusive growth model that
involves the private sector and focuses on investing in education,
vocational training and entrepreneurship.

### Define a Coherent Exchange Rate Policy

A 'stable' exchange rate is always thought to be a reflection of how
'well' the economy is being managed. Indeed, governments frequently
intervene in exchange rate management matters and ask that the
exchange rate is kept stable in nominal terms or only fluctuates around a
tight band. An appreciating exchange rate is greeted with applause.
Devaluation is always deemed to be bad. The reality is more nuanced. An
exporter is interested in the 'real' value of the dollars/he earns per unit of
exports, not the 'nominal' amount. Thus the nominal exchange rate needs
to be corrected for inflation-or more specifically, relative inflation-
meaning Pakistan's inflation vis-a-vis the inflation rates of our trading
partners and competitors yields a Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER).
Empirical studies show that exports do respond to changes in the REER
because it is an important—albeit not the only—determinant of export
success.
Historically, and even now, there has been a strong anti-export bias
in Pakistan with the REER tending towards an appreciation, which means
the exporter is getting fewer and fewer real dollars per unit of exports. If
exporters see that the improvement in real export profitability is likely to be
fleeting or dissipate through future inflation or by changes in government
policy, they will have little incentive to export and would prefer to sell in the
domestic market.
One way of forestalling REER appreciation is to allow for greater
downward flexibility in the nominal exchange rate so as to yield a constant
on rising REER. A better way is to reduce our adverse relative inflation
differential as opposed to our trading partners and competitors. However,
235this would require highly disciplined macroeconomic policies (small
fiscal deficits and a tight monetary policy stance with positive real interest
rates) that can be sustained over time. Unfortunately, this is something
that Pakistan has not been able to do. Brief periods of price stability have
given way to extended periods of high inflation rooted in lax
macroeconomic indiscipline.

Successful exporting countries, specifically in Asia, and more notably
China, keep the REER slightly depreciated thus giving their exporters a
lasting competitive edge. China is a good example. By keeping the Renminbi
at a significantly lower level than that which would be dictated by market
forces and the size of China's foreign exchange reserves, China has emerged
as an unstoppable export juggernaut. Of course in following such an exchange
rate regime China has come in for a lot of criticism, especially from the US,
because of its large and growing trade deficit with China which the US claims
robs their economy of millions of jobs.

To establish if Pakistan would benefit from a similar policy it is
important to examine some of the key economic data related to exchange
rates, balance of payments and inflation. For purposes of analysis, the
exchange rate over a three year period, between January, 2007 and July
2010, where the Pakistani Rupee underwent significant depreciation
against the US dollar and other major currencies, will be taken as an
example. From a level of Rs. 60.7/USD in January 2007 to Rs. 85.6/USD
in July 2010, the value of the Pakistani Rupee had eroded by 38.5 per cent.
Chiefly responsible for this sharp decline was the supply side shock from
global commodities, in particular crude oil which shot up from
approximately $80 per barrel to $140 per barrel. Being an oil importing
country, the trade deficit burgeoned to $15.3 billion while Forex reserves
dropped to just $6.7 billion. Inflation hit a peak of 25 per cent as the entire
consumer basket was jolted by commodity prices and massive deficit
financing from the central bank. During the same period exports grew from
$17.3 billion in FY07 to $19.6 billion in FY10, while imports jumped from
$27 billion to $31 billion. In simple terms the increase in oil prices thus
fuelled the deficit in the balance of trade and the consequent devaluation of
the Pakistani Rupee.

Would a policy of forced and greater devaluation have helped Pakistan
in the medium to long term scenario? The problem with such a strategy is
236Pakistan's unfavourable terms of trade. The terms of trade is the export price
index relative to the import price index and helps gauge capital inflow and
outflow in terms of 100 indices. In fact, a dose examination of the terms of
trade suggests that Pakistan's terms of trade are not only unfavourable but also
deteriorating for all major categories except food and live animals which
improved significantly in FY09. These have declined from 73.6 in FY05 to
63.8 in January 2007 to 54.9 in nine months FY10. This indicates that in
FY05, for every unit of import Pakistan exported 73.6 per cent of the index
value, and by nine months FY10 export unit relative to the import unit had
dropped to54.9 per cent. These figures reveal that if Pakistan devalues its
currency, the incremental cost paid for imports will be more than the additional
benefit earned from exports on a relative time basis.

The key point is that the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) is what
really matters to exports rather than the nominal exchange rate. From January
2007 the Pakistani Rupee has significantly depreciated, in nominal terms,
against the USD. This indicates that the PKR has weakened against the USD
and thus Pakistan's exports to the US and other trading partners should have
become more competitive, as they had become cheaper in units of foreign
currency. However the REER paints a different picture; it takes the nominal
exchange rate, adjusted for foreign price levels and then deflates it by
domestic inflation. This index had during the same period appreciated and the
PKR had strengthened by 5.8 per cent since January 2007. As a result instead
of Pakistani exports getting cheaper, exports have become more expensive in the
international market and hence less competitive.

The primary reason for this is domestic inflation. In FY08, CPI was 12
per cent, which spiked to 20.8 per cent in FY09 before settling down to 11.7
per cent in FY10. Essentially the domestic cost of manufacturing, transporting
and selling our goods abroad has risen to such an extent that it has neutralised
the advantage of a weak currency.

The skewed structure of Pakistan's imports and the infrastructural
inefficiencies inherent in the domestic economy prevent Pakistani exporters
from benefiting from a weaker currency. This is partly because Pakistan is an
oil-importing country with 34 per cent of the total import bill attributed to the
import of crude and refined petroleum. A weaker PKR means a higher import
bill, higher prices for transportation (7.5 per cent of CPI basket) and energy
(7.5 per cent of CPI basket) not to mention the indirect effect on perishable
237food items, house rent, recreation and other components of the inflation
basket. Higher costs not only erode the margins of exporters who already
suffer from power shortages, security threats and high interest rates but force
them to pass on the price increase to their international customers. Given that
most Pakistani exports are low value added items, they also suffer from
demand inelasticity. This means that a price decrease does not increase
volumetric demand by enough to offset the revenue loss from lower prices.
While it is tempting to think that a policy of deliberate PKR devaluation
would improve export competitiveness, the reality is that domestic inflation,
supply bottlenecks and fiscal indiscipline, would result in real appreciation as
witnessed over the last three years and, in fact, make exports less competitive.
The solution to increasing exports lies, therefore, in stabilising the
macroeconomic environment, providing adequate infrastructure and security,
access to credit, investment in product quality and value addition which are
longer term policy objectives, all necessary conditions to complement a policy
of maintaining a competitive exchange rate.
The converse of this is to keep a stable exchange rate, which is what
happened during the period, 2002-2007. During this period, Pakistan saw its
exports rise from $9 billion to $17 billion. A stable currency policy allowed
a steady build-up of reserves and investment flows. Investment rates climbed
to as high as 23 per cent as foreign direct investment felt more confident that
future returns would not be eroded by a weak currency. This allowed the
liquidity cycle to ease up leading to a benign interest rate environment,
reduced debt servicing. All good news for GDP growth as compared to
previous years where low reserves encouraging dollarisation, low investment
rates and relatively low growth.

So does a successful export-driven economy mean that Pakistan needs
to use the exchange rate more aggressively? The focus has to be the Real
Effective Exchange Rate, rather than the nominal exchange rate. Keeping
REER competitive is a necessary but insufficient condition. If Pakistan can
maintain a competitive REER, Pakistan can recoup lost competitiveness by
focusing on supply side issues which control inflation or it can continue to
play 'catch up' and do what is being done now which is a constant downward
adjustment of the nominal exchange rate hindering export competitiveness.


### Control Inflation

There is growing consensus among central bankers that medium- to
long-term price stability is the overriding goal of monetary policy. Research
has shown that maintaining low and stable inflation has helped economies to
grow, as businesses, households and individual consumers are able to make
better investment, savings and wage contract decisions. If inflation gets out
of control either due to an over­ heating of the economy or supply side factors,
central banks have generally resorted to monetary tightening as a means to
control inflation. This has the knock on effect of reducing aggregate demand
and feeding into slower growth.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)—an independent institution with full
autonomy on monetary policy—has delicately balanced two opposing
objectives, an anti-inflation policy and a pro-growth policy. There has been
an impressive array of reforms in this regard, including the Fiscal
Responsibility Act and Debt Limitation Act of June 2003, yet the reform
agenda needs to be boosted further in the current macro­ economic
environment.

While inflation was not an issue in 2002-2008, the current challenges
are more testing. In order to achieve the 7 per cent growth trajectory the SBP
needs to keep inflation low. The recent monetary tightening in response to
rising inflation has not been preferred strategy, not only because it is
politically unpopular but also because it results in increasing debt servicing
and could result in further weakness in the currency and another bout of
inflation. With Pakistan's high debt to GDP ratio as well as a growing fiscal
deficit, control of inflation becomes a pressing priority to induce confidence
in the business community and public at large about future price stability. The
SBP alone cannot control inflation without the presence of a coordinated
fiscal policy which requires support from the Ministry of Finance. The budget
announced in June 2010 was a step in the right direction as it signalled a more
responsible fiscal stance by the government. This would entail the
government sticking to an agenda where unnecessary current expenditures
are severely curtailed along with a clear policy for revenue enhancement.
Recent indicators suggest that inflation is on the rise. This has been
precipitated by the government's decision to increase electricity tariffs,
fuel prices, elimination of food subsidies and the imposition of a new
'Reformed General Sales Tax'. Further tariff increases and rises in taxation
have been announced by the government, partly driven by the additional
239resources required for rehabilitation and relief for flood affectees. The SBP
is also pointing to aggregate demand picking up, led mainly by public
sector consumption, while prospects for aggregate supply remain weak
due to energy shortages and the poor law and order situation. These
developments together with the rising total debt reinforce the need to have
renewed efforts to keep inflation and the fiscal deficit under control.
What can be done? First and most fundamentally, the government
should announce a 'Medium Term Financial Strategy' (MTFS) for the next
five years where a coordinated fiscal and monetary policy having a target
band for inflation should form a cornerstone of the government's approach.
Setting an inflation target or a band for inflation would certainly help to
engender positive expectations across the economy and help to reinforce a
'mindset' that the government is serious about controlling inflation. Given
that the vast majority of people are sensitive to rising prices, the very poor
and low income groups, as well as business and industry, lose from higher
input and capital costs in a rising inflation scenario.

Inflation-targeting is also an appealing choice as it has worked in both
developing and advanced countries. It is not an end in itself, but a means to
an end, which is achieving price stability that can be defined as low and
stable inflation. The real point is to get inflation down to, in line with, or
maybe even below its major trading partners and competitors. If Pakistan can
achieve this, then policy-makers will not need to depreciate its nominal
exchange rate and play catch-up with the adverse relative inflation
differential. Getting that adverse inflation differential down is therefore key.
The target range within such a context should be between 5 to 8 per cent over
the next five years.

Secondly, this strategy should be supplemented by having a closely
aligned industry and trade policy, and a clear policy on raising the level of
productivity for capital and labour in key export sectors as well as those
sectors where capacity constraints result in price increases of goods and
services. Examples of these sectors would include food, housing and energy-
which collectively account for over 60 per cent of the consumer price index.
In particular, at a time when most nations globally are scrambling for food
security, Pakistan's government would reap significant future dividends if it
were to have a strong agricultural policy to encourage investments that
enhance agricultural output and productivity. Increased attention to Research
240and Development would need to be an integral part of a productivity
enhancement drive, particularly in agriculture and the SME sectors, which are
export oriented. This is another way of improving competitiveness, which
aims at cutting unit costs by raising productivity of capital and labour. To have
a stable exchange rate raising productivity in the export sector is the only way
to cut costs and increase export profitability. This would not only help to curb
inflation but also allow an export surplus which would help in improving long
term macroeconomic indicators.

Thirdly, the official consumer price index could be reconstituted to
reduce the weight of food and energy which are dependent on exogenous
factors and a global pricing mechanism which is beyond the control of
governments. This would leave other items in the CPI basket such as wages,
rent, medical care, transportation, textile and apparel goods prices intact and
would be a more significant monitor of how successful the government is in
terms of achieving its inflation target.

Fourthly, to reinforce the stable price 'mindset', the government could
enact an Act of Parliament which compels subsequent governments to adhere
to a consistent policy of bringing inflation within the target band. In the
context of an Act of Parliament, caveats can be structured for unexpected
natural disasters such as the 2010 floods that produced a sharp increase in the
price of food and other necessities, which offset the benefits of an inflation
targeting policy.

Conclusion

Despite turbulent economic and political headwinds over the last three
decades Pakistan's economy has not only avoided collapse but has recorded
an average growth rate of over 5 per cent per annum. Pakistan's medium and
longer-term future will be driven by key demographic and economic trends.
As the focus of much international attention, Pakistan has the opportunity to
push ahead on key structural reforms. Couple with a steady flow of loans,
assistance and investments, this has the potential to hedge any economic
downturn in the short to medium term. The list of things Pakistan needs to do
is not new. Yet they are difficult things to achieve and require a clearly
defined implementation framework and the full support of government
bureaucracy, industry, businesses and the public at large with priority given
to those measures that can create jobs to accommodate new people entering
the work force each year.

241While the full extent of damage emanating from the floods in Pakistan
is not known at the time of writing this chapter, billions of dollars will be
required for rebuilding and reconstruction. Whilst the floods have caused
much misery and devastation the disaster can act as a catalyst to formulate a
clear economic vision. The need for better governance, for creating social
safety nets for the poor and for accelerating growth can become pressing
national issues. This, in turn, can force the government in power to become
more transparent and accountable to the public.
There are two scenarios that can emerge. The best-case scenario is one
where economics prevails over geo-political risks, and a collective will under
the leadership of a credible government is created to transform the economic
landscape of Pakistan. This can result in a change in perception about
Pakistan, trigger an investment cycle targeting growth in infrastructure
and propel Pakistan into the 7-8 per cent growth trajectory.
The second scenario is one where future growth is unstable and low.
Political and geo-political instability continues to weaken an already fragile
economy and investment rates remain low due to the poor internal security
situation. In this scenario, Pakistan's population, instead of being a natural
advantage, could turn into a crisis if young people are unable to find economic
opportunities and where unmatched expectations result in discontentment,
unemployment and growing disparities between the top and bottom end of the
social pyramid.

Pakistan's record in reform and policy implementation to achieve long-
term economic development has at best been marked by missed opportunities
and failures. The risks of failure are much greater today than at any time in
the past, but so too are the rewards of meaningful reform.
