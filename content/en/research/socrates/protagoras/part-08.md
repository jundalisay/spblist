{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Now then, you think that some men are temperate, and yet unjust? And temperance is good sense? And good sense is good counsel in doing injustice if the injustice succeeds?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Protagoras" >}}
Yes, yes, and yes.
{{< /r >}}

<!-- If they succeed, I said, or if they do not succeed?

If they succeed. -->

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Do you believe the gods exist? And is the good that which is expedient for man?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Protagoras" >}}
Yes. There are some things which may be inexpedient, and yet I call them good.
{{< /r >}}


I thought that Protagoras was getting ruffled and excited; he seemed to be setting himself in an attitude of war. Seeing this, I minded my business, and gently said:â€”

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
When you say that things inexpedient are good, do you mean inexpedient for man only, or inexpedient altogether? and do you call the latter good?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Protagoras" >}}
Certainly not the last. Many things such as meats, drinks, medicines, etc are inexpedient for man. Some things are expedient.

Some are neither expedient nor inexpedient for man, but only for horses.

Some for oxen only. Some for dogs. Some only for trees. Some for the roots of trees and not for their branches.

For example, manure is good around the roots of a tree. But it is destructive if thrown on the shoots and young branches.

Olive oil is mischievous to all plants and injurious to the hair of animals except man. But it is beneficial to human hair and to the human body generally.
{{< /r >}}

 <!-- and even in this application (so various and changeable is the nature of the benefit), that which is the greatest good to the outward parts of a man, is a very great evil to his inward parts: and for this reason physicians always forbid their patients the use of oil in their food, except in very small quantities, just enough to extinguish the disagreeable sensation of smell in meats and sauces. -->

The people cheered Protagoras.

<!--  l a="Socrates" >}}
I have a wretched memory. When any one makes a long speech to me I never remember what he is talking about.

As then, if I had been deaf, and you were going to converse with me, you would have had to raise your voice; so now, having such a bad memory, I will ask you to cut your answers shorter, if you would take me with you.

 r a="Protagoras" >}}
What do you mean? Should I shorten my answers as I see fit or as you see fit?
 /r >}}
 -->

<!-- You can speak and teach others to speak about the same things at such length that words never seemed to fail, or with such brevity that no one could use fewer of them.

Please therefore, if you talk with me, to adopt the latter or more compendious method. -->
{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Please shorten your answers.
{{< /l >}}


<!--  r a="Protagoras" >}}
I have fought many battles of words. If I had followed the method of disputation which my adversaries desired, as you want me to do, I should have been no better than another, and the name of Protagoras would have been nowhere.

Protagoras:
- was not satisfied with his previous answers
- would not play the part of answerer any more if he could help

I thought that it was useless to continue the conversation.
 -->

<!--  l a="Socrates" >}}
Protagoras, I do not wish to force the conversation upon you if you had rather not, but when you are willing to argue with me in such a way that I can follow you, then I will argue with you.

Now you, as is said of you by others and as you say of yourself, are able to have discussions in shorter forms of speech as well as in longer, for you are a master of wisdom; but I cannot manage these long speeches: I only wish that I could. 

You, on the other hand, who are capable of either, ought to speak shorter as I beg you, and then we might converse. But I see that you are disinclined, and as I have an engagement which will prevent my staying to hear you at greater length (for I have to be in another place), I will depart; although I should have liked to have heard you.
