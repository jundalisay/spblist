Why did the Creator make this world of generation? 

He was good.* The good can never have any jealousy of anything. 

Being free from jealousy, He desired that all things should be as like Himself as they could be.

{{< n n="Good here means Positive and inclined to create and preserve, as opposed to Negative which wants to destroy. This implies that created being want to exist. However, the pure Positivity of the Creator is a fallacy from actual experience." >}} 


<!-- This is in the truest sense the origin of creation and of the world, as we shall do well in believing on the testimony of wise men: God wamted that all things should be good and nothing bad, so far as this was attainable.  -->

He found that the whole visible sphere was moving in an irregular and disorderly way. 

Out of disorder he brought order, considering that order was better than disorder. 
 <!-- this was in every way better than the other.  -->

<!-- Now the deeds of the best could never be or have been other than the fairest; and the Creator,  -->

<!-- Reflecting on the things which are visible by nature,  -->

He found generally that:
- the intelligent were fairer than the unintelligent creatures
- intelligence could not be present in anything which was devoid of soul [i.e. rocks and inanimate objects]
 <!-- taken as a whole was fairer than  taken as a whole;  -->

 <!-- which was by nature -->
This is why, when he was framing the universe, he put intelligence in soul* and soul in body so that his work would be  fairest and best. 
<!-- - Using the language of probability, we may say that  -->
The world became a living creature truly endowed with soul and intelligence by God's providence.

{{< n n="Intelligence here is the Positive Force, the soul is the aethereal mind or material" >}}


In the likeness of what animal did the Creator make the world? 

<!-- It would be an unworthy thing to liken it to any nature which exists as a part only; for nothing can be beautiful which is like any imperfect thing; but let us suppose the world to be the very image of that whole of which all other animals both individually and in their tribes are portions.  -->

The original of the universe contains in itself all intelligible beings, just as this world comprehends us and all other visible creatures. 

The Deity intended to make this world like the fairest and most perfect of intelligible beings. 

He framed one visible animal comprehending within itself all other animals of a kindred nature. 

<!-- Are we right in saying that there  -->


### Only One World [One Multiverse]

Is there one world? Or are they many and infinite? 

If the created copy is to accord with the original, then there must be one only.

For that which includes all other intelligible creatures cannot have a second or companion.
- In that case, there needs to be another Creator which would include both.
- Those worlds would then be parts.
- Their likeness would then be based on that Creator.

<!--  and not  more truly said to resemble not them, but that other which included them.  
 of another living being  -->

Thus, the Creator made only one world.*

{{< n n="We call this Saguna Brahma or Totality of Existence. Each world has many copies within that single Brahma or Totality. " >}}

<!-- In order then that the world might be solitary, like the perfect animal, the creator made not two worlds or an infinite number of them; but there is and ever will be one only-begotten and created heaven. -->

The created is necessarily corporeal, visible, and tangible. 

The visibility is facilitated by fire [electromagnetism]. 

The tangibility is facilitated by solidity [strong force]. 

Nothing is solid without earth [strong force].
- Wherefore in the beginning of creation, the body of the universe was made of fire [electromagnetism] and earth [strong force]. 

But two things cannot be rightly put together without a third. **There must be some bond of union between them.** 

The fairest bond is that which makes the most complete fusion* of:
- itself and
- the things which it combines

{{< n n="In Social Superphysics, this is why the leaders of society must bind themselves with the citizens, instead of commanding from afar. " >}}


Proportion is best adapted to effect such a union. 

If a set of any 3 numbers has a mean, the 1st number is 

{{< n n="For example, 1 and 5 has 3 as its 'mean' being away by 2 units from both." >}}


<!-- Whenever there are 3 numbers, the mean is the 

Whenever in any 3 numbers, whether cube or square, there is a mean, which is to the last term what the first term is to it.

When the mean is to the first term as the last term is to the meanâ€”then the mean becoming first and last, and the first and last both becoming means, they will all of them of necessity come to be the same, and having become the same with one another will be all one.  -->


If the universal frame had been created a surface only and having no depth, a single mean would have sufficed to bind together itself and the other terms. 

But now, the world must be solid. Solid bodies are always compacted two means, not one.*

{{< n n="In a universe where there is only light or electromagnetism, there would only be one 'mean'. But since we live in a universe with solid material bodies, there are 2. This manifests as wave-particle duality." >}}


And so, God placed water [convertible] and air [spacetime] in the mean between fire [electromagnetism] and earth [strong force].

These have the same proportion as far as possible. Thus he bound and put together a visible and tangible heaven.

<!-- (Fire is to air, as air is to water, and as air is to water so is water to earth) -->
