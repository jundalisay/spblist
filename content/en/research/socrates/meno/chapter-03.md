SOCRATES: Then let us see whether what you say is true from another point of view; for very likely you may be right:—You affirm virtue to be the power of attaining goods?

SOCRATES: And the goods which you mean are such as health and wealth and the possession of gold and silver, and having office and honour in the state—those are what you would call goods?

MENO: Yes, I should include all those.

SOCRATES: Then, according to Meno, who is the hereditary friend of the great king, virtue is the power of getting silver and gold; and would you add that they must be gained piously, justly, or do you deem this to be of no consequence? And is any mode of acquisition, even if unjust and dishonest, equally to be deemed virtue?

MENO: Not virtue, Socrates, but vice.

SOCRATES: Then justice or temperance or holiness, or some other part of virtue, as would appear, must accompany the acquisition, and without them the mere acquisition of good will not be virtue.

MENO: Why, how can there be virtue without these?

SOCRATES: And the non-acquisition of gold and silver in a dishonest manner for oneself or another, or in other words the want of them, may be equally virtue?

SOCRATES: Then the acquisition of such goods is no more virtue than the non-acquisition and want of them, but whatever is accompanied by justice or honesty is virtue, and whatever is devoid of justice is vice.

MENO: It cannot be otherwise, in my judgment.

SOCRATES: And were we not saying just now that justice, temperance, and the like, were each of them a part of virtue? And so, Meno, this is the way in which you mock me. 

I asked you to deliver virtue into my hands whole and unbroken, and I gave you a pattern according to which you were to frame your answer; and you have forgotten already, and tell me that virtue is the power of attaining good justly, or with justice; and justice you acknowledge to be a part of virtue.

Then it follows from your own admissions, that virtue is doing what you do with a part of virtue; for justice and the like are said by you to be parts of virtue.

MENO: What of that?

SOCRATES: What of that! Why, did not I ask you to tell me the nature of virtue as a whole? And you are very far from telling me this; but declare every action to be virtue which is done with a part of virtue; as though you had told me and I must already know the whole of virtue, and this too when frittered away into little pieces. And, therefore, my dear Meno, I fear that I must begin again and repeat the same question: What is virtue? for otherwise, I can only say, that every action done with a part of virtue is virtue; what else is the meaning of saying that every action done with justice is virtue? Ought I not to ask the question over again; for can any one who does not know virtue know a part of virtue?

MENO: No; I do not say that he can.

SOCRATES: Do you remember how, in the example of figure, we rejected any answer given in terms which were as yet unexplained or unadmitted?

MENO: Yes, Socrates; and we were quite right in doing so.

SOCRATES: But then, my friend, do not suppose that we can explain to any one the nature of virtue as a whole through some unexplained portion of virtue, or anything at all in that fashion; we should only have to ask over again the old question, What is virtue? Am I not right?

Then What, according to you and your friend Gorgias, is the definition of virtue?

{{< r a="Meno" >}}
I used to be told, before I knew you, that you were always doubting yourself and making others doubt.

Now you are casting your spells over me. You are like the flat torpedo fish, who torpifies those who come near him and touch him, as you have now torpified me. For my soul and my tongue are really torpid. I do not know how to answer you even if I have listened to an infinite variety of speeches about virtue before now.

But now I cannot even say what virtue is. You are very wise in not going to other places as you do in Athens, as you would be cast into prison as a magician.

SOCRATES: You are a rogue, Meno, and had all but caught me. You made a simile about me so that I might make another simile about you. 

<!-- For I know that all pretty young gentlemen like to have pretty similes made about them—as well they may—but I shall not return the compliment. As to my being a torpedo,  -->

If the torpedo is torpid as well as the cause of torpidity in others, then I am a torpedo, but not otherwise. I perplex others, not because I am clear, but because I am utterly perplexed myself. 

I do not know what virtue is and I want to join with you in the enquiry.



MENO: How will you enquire into that which you do not know? 

<!-- What will you put forth as the subject of enquiry? And if you find what you want, how will you ever know that this is the thing which you did not know? -->

SOCRATES: I know, Meno, what you mean; but just see what a tiresome dispute you are introducing. You argue that a man cannot enquire either about that which he knows, or about that which he does not know; for if he knows, he has no need to enquire; and if not, he cannot; for he does not know the very subject about which he is to enquire (Compare Aristot. Post. Anal.).

MENO: Well, Socrates, and is not the argument sound?

SOCRATES: I have heard from certain wise men and women who spoke of things divine, of a glorious truth. Some of them were priests and priestesses, who had studied how they might be able to give a reason of their profession: 

There have been poets also, who spoke of these things by inspiration, like Pindar, and many others who were inspired.

They say—mark, now, and see whether their words are true—they say that the soul of man is immortal, and at one time has an end, which is termed dying, and at another time is born again, but is never destroyed. 

The moral is, that a man ought to live always in perfect holiness. 'For in the ninth year Persephone sends the souls of those from whom she has received the penalty of ancient crime back again from beneath into the light of the sun above, and these are they who become noble kings and mighty men and great in wisdom and are called saintly heroes in after ages.' 

The soul, then, as being immortal, and having been born again many times, and having seen all things that exist, whether in this world or in the world below, has knowledge of them all; and it is no wonder that she should be able to call to remembrance all that she ever knew about virtue, and about everything; 

For as all nature is akin, and the soul has learned all things; there is no difficulty in her eliciting or as men say learning, out of a single recollection all the rest, if a man is strenuous and does not faint; for all enquiry and all learning is but recollection. 

Therefore we ought not to listen to this sophistical argument about the impossibility of enquiry: for it will make us idle; and is sweet only to the sluggard; but the other saying will make us active and inquisitive. In that confiding, I will gladly enquire with you into the nature of virtue.


MENO: Yes, but what do you mean that we do not learn, and that learning is only a process of recollection?

SOCRATES: I told you, Meno, just now that you were a rogue, and now you ask whether I can teach you, when I am saying that there is no teaching, but only recollection; and thus you imagine that you will involve me in a contradiction.

MENO: I had no such intention. I only asked the question from habit.

SOCRATES: I will demonstrate on one of your numerous attendants. He is Greek, and speaks Greek, does he not. Attend now to the questions which I ask him, and observe whether he learns of me or only remembers. 

Tell me, boy, you know that this is a square. It is a square because it has these 4 lines equal. These lines which I have drawn through the middle of the square are also equal. A square may be of any size.

If one side is 2 feet, and the other is 2 feet, how much will the whole be? If in one direction the space was of two feet, and in the other direction of one foot, the whole would be of two feet taken once.

But since this side is also of 2 feet, there are twice 2 feet. Then the square is of twice two feet?

How many are twice two feet?

BOY: Four, Socrates.

SOCRATES: There are other squares twice as large as this, and having like this the lines equal. How many feet will that be?

BOY: 8 feet.

SOCRATES: And now try and tell me the length of the line which forms the side of that double square: this is two feet—what will that be?

BOY: Clearly, Socrates, it will be double.
