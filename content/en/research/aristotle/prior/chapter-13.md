### Chapter 13

Perhaps enough has been said about the proof of necessity, how it comes about and how it differs
from the proof of a simple statement. We proceed to discuss that which is possible, when and
how and by what means it can be proved. I use the terms 'to be possible' and 'the possible' of that which is not necessary but, being assumed, results in nothing impossible. We say indeed
ambiguously of the necessary that it is possible.

But that my definition of the possible is correct is clear from the phrases by which we deny or on the contrary affirm possibility. For the
expressions 'it is not possible to belong', 'it is impossible to belong', and 'it is necessary not to
belong' are either identical or follow from one another; consequently their opposites also, 'it is
possible to belong', 'it is not impossible to belong', and 'it is not necessary not to belong', will
either be identical or follow from one another. For of everything the affirmation or the denial
holds good. That which is possible then will be not necessary and that which is not necessary 
will be possible. It results that all premises in the mode of possibility are convertible into one
another. I mean not that the affirmative are convertible into the negative, but that those which are
affirmative in form admit of conversion by opposition, e.g. 'it is possible to belong' may be
converted into 'it is possible not to belong', and 'it is possible for A to belong to all B' into 'it is
possible for A to belong to no B' or 'not to all B', and 'it is possible for A to belong to some B'
into 'it is possible for A not to belong to some B'. And similarly the other propositions in this
mode can be converted. For since that which is possible is not necessary, and that which is not
necessary may possibly not belong, it is clear that if it is possible that A should belong to B, it is
possible also that it should not belong to B: and if it is possible that it should belong to all, it is
also possible that it should not belong to all. The same holds good in the case of particular
affirmations: for the proof is identical. And such premises are affirmative and not negative; for
'to be possible' is in the same rank as 'to be', as was said above.
Having made these distinctions we next point out that the expression 'to be possible' is used in
two ways. In one it means to happen generally and fall short of necessity, e.g. man's turning gray
or growing or decaying, or generally what naturally belongs to a thing (for this has not its
necessity unbroken, since man's existence is not continuous for ever, although if a man does
exist, it comes about either necessarily or generally). In another sense the expression means the
indefinite, which can be both thus and not thus, e.g. an animal's walking or an earthquake's
taking place while it is walking, or generally what happens by chance: for none of these inclines
by nature in the one way more than in the opposite.
That which is possible in each of its two senses is convertible into its opposite, not however in
the same way: but what is natural is convertible because it does not necessarily belong (for in
this sense it is possible that a man should not grow gray) and what is indefinite is convertible
because it inclines this way no more than that. Science and demonstrative syllogism are not
concerned with things which are indefinite, because the middle term is uncertain; but they are
concerned with things that are natural, and as a rule arguments and inquiries are made about
things which are possible in this sense. Syllogisms indeed can be made about the former, but it is
unusual at any rate to inquire about them.
These matters will be treated more definitely in the sequel; our business at present is to state the
moods and nature of the syllogism made from possible premises. The expression 'it is possible
for this to belong to that' may be understood in two senses: 'that' may mean either that to which
'that' belongs or that to which it may belong; for the expression 'A is possible of the subject of B'
means that it is possible either of that of which B is stated or of that of which B may possibly be
stated. It makes no difference whether we say, A is possible of the subject of B, or all B admits
of A. It is clear then that the expression 'A may possibly belong to all B' might be used in two
senses. First then we must state the nature and characteristics of the syllogism which arises if B
is possible of the subject of C, and A is possible of the subject of B. For thus both premises are
assumed in the mode of possibility; but whenever A is possible of that of which B is true, one
premise is a simple assertion, the other a problematic. Consequently we must start from premises
which are similar in form, as in the other cases.

Chapter 14

Whenever A may possibly belong to all B, and B to all C, there will be a perfect syllogism to
prove that A may possibly belong to all C. This is clear from the definition: for it was in this way that we explained 'to be possible for one term to belong to all of another'. Similarly if it is possible for A to belong no B, and for B to belong to all C, then it is possible for A to belong to no C. 

For the statement that it is possible for A not to belong to that of which B may be true
means (as we saw) that none of those things which can possibly fall under the term B is left out
of account. But whenever A may belong to all B, and B may belong to no C, then indeed no
syllogism results from the premises assumed, but if the premise BC is converted after the manner
of problematic propositions, the same syllogism results as before. For since it is possible that B
should belong to no C, it is possible also that it should belong to all C. This has been stated
above. Consequently if B is possible for all C, and A is possible for all B, the same syllogism
again results. Similarly if in both the premises the negative is joined with 'it is possible': e.g. if A may belong to none of the Bs, and B to none of the Cs. No syllogism results from the assumed premises, but if they are converted we shall have the same syllogism as before. It is clear then
that if the minor premise is negative, or if both premises are negative, either no syllogism results, or if one it is not perfect. For the necessity results from the conversion.
But if one of the premises is universal, the other particular, when the major premise is universal
there will be a perfect syllogism. For if A is possible for all B, and B for some C, then A is
possible for some C. This is clear from the definition of being possible. Again if A may belong to
no B, and B may belong to some of the Cs, it is necessary that A may possibly not belong to
some of the Cs. The proof is the same as above. But if the particular premise is negative, and the
universal is affirmative, the major still being universal and the minor particular, e.g. A is possible
for all B, B may possibly not belong to some C, then a clear syllogism does not result from the
assumed premises, but if the particular premise is converted and it is laid down that B possibly
may belong to some C, we shall have the same conclusion as before, as in the cases given at the
beginning.
But if the major premise is the minor universal, whether both are affirmative, or negative, or
different in quality, or if both are indefinite or particular, in no way will a syllogism be possible.
For nothing prevents B from reaching beyond A, so that as predicates cover unequal areas. Let C
be that by which B extends beyond A. To C it is not possible that A should belong-either to all or
to none or to some or not to some, since premises in the mode of possibility are convertible and it
is possible for B to belong to more things than A can. Further, this is obvious if we take terms;
for if the premises are as assumed, the major term is both possible for none of the minor and
must belong to all of it. Take as terms common to all the cases under consideration 'animal'-
'white'-'man', where the major belongs necessarily to the minor; 'animal'-'white'-'garment', where
it is not possible that the major should belong to the minor. It is clear then that if the terms are
related in this manner, no syllogism results. For every syllogism proves that something belongs
either simply or necessarily or possibly. It is clear that there is no proof of the first or of the
second. For the affirmative is destroyed by the negative, and the negative by the affirmative.
There remains the proof of possibility. But this is impossible. For it has been proved that if the
terms are related in this manner it is both necessary that the major should belong to all the minor
and not possible that it should belong to any. Consequently there cannot be a syllogism to prove
the possibility; for the necessary (as we stated) is not possible.
It is clear that if the terms are universal in possible premises a syllogism always results in the
first figure, whether they are affirmative or negative, only a perfect syllogism results in the first 
15
case, an imperfect in the second. But possibility must be understood according to the definition
laid down, not as covering necessity. This is sometimes forgotten.
