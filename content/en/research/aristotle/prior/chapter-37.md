### Chapter 37

The expressions 'this belongs to that' and 'this holds true of that' must be understood in as many
ways as there are different categories, and these categories must be taken either with or without
qualification, and further as simple or compound: the same holds good of the corresponding
negative expressions. We must consider these points and define them better.


### Chapter 38

A term which is repeated in the premises ought to be joined to the first extreme, not to the
middle. I mean for example that if a syllogism should be made proving that there is knowledge
of justice, that it is good, the expression 'that it is good' (or 'qua good') should be joined to the first term.

Let A stand for 'knowledge that it is good', B for good, C for justice. It is true to predicate A of B. For of the good there is knowledge that it is good. Also it is true to predicate B of C. For justice is identical with a good. In this way an analysis of the argument can be made.

But if the expression 'that it is good' were added to B, the conclusion will not follow: for A will be true of B, but B will not be true of C. For to predicate of justice the term 'good that it is good' is false and not intelligible. Similarly if it should be proved that the healthy is an object of
knowledge qua good, of goat-stag an object of knowledge qua not existing, or man perishable
qua an object of sense: in every case in which an addition is made to the predicate, the addition
must be joined to the extreme.

The position of the terms is not the same when something is established without qualification
and when it is qualified by some attribute or condition, e.g. when the good is proved to be an
object of knowledge and when it is proved to be an object of knowledge that it is good. If it has
been proved to be an object of knowledge without qualification, we must put as middle term 'that
which is', but if we add the qualification 'that it is good', the middle term must be 'that which is something'. Let A stand for 'knowledge that it is something', B stand for 'something', and C stand for 'good'.

To predicate A of B: for ex hypothesi there is a science of that which is something, that it is something. B too is true of C: for that which C represents is something. 

Consequently A is true of C: there will then be knowledge of the good, that it is good: for ex
hypothesi the term 'something' indicates the thing's special nature. But if 'being' were taken as
middle and 'being' simply were joined to the extreme, not 'being something', we should not have
had a syllogism proving that there is knowledge of the good, that it is good, but that it is; e.g. let A stand for knowledge that it is, B for being, C for good. Clearly then in syllogisms which are thus limited we must take the terms in the way stated.


### Chapter 39

We should also exchange terms which have the same value, word for word, and phrase for
phrase, and word and phrase, and always take a word in preference to a phrase: for thus the
setting out of the terms will be easier. For example if it makes no difference whether we say that
the supposable is not the genus of the opinable or that the opinable is not identical with a
particular kind of supposable (for what is meant is the same in both statements), it is better to
take as the terms the supposable and the opinable in preference to the phrase suggested.


### Chapter 40

Since the expressions 'pleasure is good' and 'pleasure is the good' are not identical, we must not
set out the terms in the same way; but if the syllogism is to prove that pleasure is the good, the
term must be 'the good', but if the object is to prove that pleasure is good, the term will be 'good'. Similarly in all other cases.


### Chapter 41

It is not the same, either in fact or in speech, that A belongs to all of that to which B belongs, and that A belongs to all of that to all of which B belongs: for nothing prevents B from belonging to
C, though not to all C: e.g. let B stand for beautiful, and C for white. If beauty belongs to
something white, it is true to say that beauty belongs to that which is white; but not perhaps to
everything that is white. If then A belongs to B, but not to everything of which B is predicated,
then whether B belongs to all C or merely belongs to C, it is not necessary that A should belong, 

I do not say to all C, but even to C at all. But if A belongs to everything of which B is truly
stated, it will follow that A can be said of all of that of all of which B is said. If however A is said of that of all of which B may be said, nothing prevents B belonging to C, and yet A not
belonging to all C or to any C at all. If then we take three terms it is clear that the expression 'A is said of all of which B is said' means this, 'A is said of all the things of which B is said'. 

And if B is said of all of a third term, so also is A: but if B is not said of all of the third term, there is no necessity that A should be said of all of it.

We must not suppose that something absurd results through setting out the terms: for we do not
use the existence of this particular thing, but imitate the geometrician who says that 'this line a foot long' or 'this straight line' or 'this line without breadth' exists although it does not, but does not use the diagrams in the sense that he reasons from them. For in general, if two things are not
related as whole to part and part to whole, the prover does not prove from them, and so no
syllogism a is formed. We (I mean the learner) use the process of setting out terms like
perception by sense, not as though it were impossible to demonstrate without these illustrative
terms, as it is to demonstrate without the premises of the syllogism.
