If men wish to establish something about some whole, they must look to the subjects of that
which is being established (the subjects of which it happens to be asserted), and the attributes
which follow that of which it is to be predicated.

For if any of these subjects is the same as any
of these attributes, the attribute originally in question must belong to the subject originally in
question. 

But if the purpose is to establish not a universal but a particular proposition, they must look for the terms of which the terms in question are predicable: for if any of these are identical, the attribute in question must belong to some of the subject in question. Whenever the one term
has to belong to none of the other, one must look to the consequents of the subject, and to those
attributes which cannot possibly be present in the predicate in question: or conversely to the
attributes which cannot possibly be present in the subject, and to the consequents of the
predicate. If any members of these groups are identical, one of the terms in question cannot
possibly belong to any of the other. 

Sometimes a syllogism in the first figure results, sometimes a syllogism in the second. But if the object is to establish a particular negative proposition, we must find antecedents of the subject in question and attributes which cannot possibly belong to the predicate in question.

If any members of these two groups are identical, it follows that one of the terms in question does not belong to some of the other. Perhaps each of these statements will become clearer in the following way. Suppose the consequents of A are designated by B, the antecedents of A by C, attributes which cannot possibly belong to A by D.


Suppose again that the attributes of E are designated by F, the antecedents of E by G, and
attributes which cannot belong to E by H. If then one of the Cs should be identical with one of
the Fs, A must belong to all E: for F belongs to all E, and A to all C, consequently A belongs to
all E. If C and G are identical, A must belong to some of the Es: for A follows C, and E follows
all G. If F and D are identical, A will belong to none of the Es by a prosyllogism: for since the
negative proposition is convertible, and F is identical with D, A will belong to none of the Fs, but F belongs to all E. Again, if B and H are identical, A will belong to none of the Es: for B will belong to all A, but to no E: for it was assumed to be identical with H, and H belonged to none of
the Es. 

If D and G are identical, A will not belong to some of the Es: for it will not belong to G, because it does not belong to D: but G falls under E: consequently A will not belong to some of
the Es. If B is identical with G, there will be a converted syllogism: for E will belong to all A
since B belongs to A and E to B (for B was found to be identical with G): but that A should
belong to all E is not necessary, but it must belong to some E because it is possible to convert the universal statement into a particular.

In every proposition which requires proof we must look to the aforesaid
relations of the subject and predicate in question: for all syllogisms proceed through these. But if we are seeking consequents and antecedents we must look for those which are primary and most
universal, e.g. in reference to E we must look to KF rather than to F alone, and in reference to A
we must look to KC rather than to C alone. For if A belongs to KF, it belongs both to F and to E:
but if it does not follow KF, it may yet follow F. Similarly we must consider the antecedents of 
A itself: for if a term follows the primary antecedents, it will follow those also which are
subordinate, but if it does not follow the former, it may yet follow the latter.

The inquiry proceeds through the three terms and the two premises, and that all the syllogisms proceed through the aforesaid figures. For it is proved that A belongs to all E,
whenever an identical term is found among the Cs and Fs. This will be the middle term; A and E
will be the extremes. So the first figure is formed. And A will belong to some E, whenever C and
G are apprehended to be the same. This is the last figure: for G becomes the middle term. And A
will belong to no E, when D and F are identical. Thus we have both the first figure and the
middle figure; the first, because A belongs to no F, since the negative statement is convertible,
and F belongs to all E: the middle figure because D belongs to no A, and to all E. And A will not
belong to some E, whenever D and G are identical. This is the last figure: for A will belong to no
G, and E will belong to all G. Clearly then all syllogisms proceed through the aforesaid figures,
and we must not select consequents of all the terms, because no syllogism is produced from
them. For (as we saw) it is not possible at all to establish a proposition from consequents, and it is not possible to refute by means of a consequent of both the terms in question: for the middle
term must belong to the one, and not belong to the other.


It is clear too that other methods of inquiry by selection of middle terms are useless to produce a syllogism, e.g. if the consequents of the terms in question are identical, or if the antecedents of A are identical with those attributes which cannot possibly belong to E, or if those attributes are
identical which cannot belong to either term: for no syllogism is produced by means of these. For
if the consequents are identical, e.g. B and F, we have the middle figure with both premises
affirmative: if the antecedents of A are identical with attributes which cannot belong to E, e.g. C with H, we have the first figure with its minor premise negative. If attributes which cannot
belong to either term are identical, e.g. C and H, both premises are negative, either in the first or in the middle figure.

But no syllogism is possible in this way.
It is evident too that we must find out which terms in this inquiry are identical, not which are
different or contrary, first because the object of our investigation is the middle term, and the
middle term must be not diverse but identical. Secondly, wherever it happens that a syllogism
results from taking contraries or terms which cannot belong to the same thing, all arguments can
be reduced to the aforesaid moods, e.g. if B and F are contraries or cannot belong to the same
thing. For if these are taken, a syllogism will be formed to prove that A belongs to none of the
Es, not however from the premises taken but in the aforesaid mood. For B will belong to all A
and to no E. Consequently B must be identical with one of the Hs. Again, if B and G cannot
belong to the same thing, it follows that A will not belong to some of the Es: for then too we
shall have the middle figure: for B will belong to all A and to no G. Consequently B must be
identical with some of the Hs. For the fact that B and G cannot belong to the same thing differs
in no way from the fact that B is identical with some of the Hs: for that includes everything
which cannot belong to E.
It is clear then that from the inquiries taken by themselves no syllogism results; but if B and F
are contraries B must be identical with one of the Hs, and the syllogism results through these
terms. It turns out then that those who inquire in this manner are looking gratuitously for some
other way than the necessary way because they have failed to observe the identity of the Bs with
the Hs.
