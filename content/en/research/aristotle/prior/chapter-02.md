## Chapter 2

Every premise states that something that exists or must exist or might exist as the attribute of something else.

Of these 3 kinds, some are affirmative, others negative, in respect of each of the 3 modes of attribution.

Some affirmative and negative premises are universal, others particular, others indefinite.

It is necessary then that in universal attribution the terms of the negative premise should be convertible, e.g. if no pleasure is good, then no good will be pleasure; the terms of the affirmative must be convertible, not however, universally, but in part, e.g. if every pleasure is good, some good must be pleasure; the particular affirmative must convert in part (for if some pleasure is good, then some good will be pleasure); but the particular negative need not convert, for if some animal is not man, it does not follow that some man is not animal.

First then take a universal negative with the terms A and B. If no B is A, neither can any A be B.
For if some A (say C) were B, it would not be true that no B is A; for C is a B. But if every B is
A then some A is B. For if no A were B, then no B could be A. But we assumed that every B is
A. Similarly too, if the premise is particular. For if some B is A, then some of the As must be B.
For if none were, then no B would be A. But if some B is not A, there is no necessity that some
of the As should not be B; e.g. let B stand for animal and A for man. Not every animal is a man;
but every man is an animal.

### Chapter 3

The same manner of conversion will hold good also in respect of necessary premises. The universal negative converts universally; each of the affirmatives converts into a particular. If it is necessary that no B is A, it is necessary also that no A is B. For if it is possible that some A is B, it would be possible also that some B is A. If all or some B is A of necessity, it is necessary also that some A is B: for if there were no necessity, neither would some of the Bs be A necessarily. 

But the particular negative does not convert, for the same reason which we have already stated.

In respect of possible premises, since possibility is used in several senses (for we say that what is necessary and what is not necessary and what is potential is possible), affirmative statements will all convert in a manner similar to those described. For if it is possible that all or some B is A, it will be possible that some A is B. For if that were not possible, then no B could possibly be A.
This has been already proved. But in negative statements the case is different. Whatever is said
to be possible, either because B necessarily is A, or because B is not necessarily A, admits of
conversion like other negative statements, e.g. if one should say, it is possible that man is not
horse, or that no garment is white. For in the former case the one term necessarily does not 
3
belong to the other; in the latter there is no necessity that it should: and the premise converts like other negative statements. For if it is possible for no man to be a horse, it is also admissible for no horse to be a man; and if it is admissible for no garment to be white, it is also admissible for nothing white to be a garment. 

If any white thing must be a garment, then some garment will
necessarily be white. This has been already proved. The particular negative also must be treated
like those dealt with above. But if anything is said to be possible because it is the general rule and natural (and it is in this way we define the possible), the negative premises can no longer be converted like the simple negatives; the universal negative premise does not convert, and the particular does.

This will be plain when we speak about the possible. At present we may take this
much as clear in addition to what has been said: the statement that it is possible that no B is A or some B is not A is affirmative in form: for the expression 'is possible' ranks along with 'is', and 'is' makes an affirmation always and in every case, whatever the terms to which it is added, in predication, e.g. 'it is not-good' or 'it is not-white' or in a word 'it is not-this'. But this also will be proved in the sequel.

In conversion these premises will behave like the other affirmative
propositions.
