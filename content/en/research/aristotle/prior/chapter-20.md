### Chapter 20


In the last figure a syllogism is possible whether both or only one of the premises is problematic.

When the premises are problematic the conclusion will be problematic; and also when one
premise is problematic, the other assertoric. But when the other premise is necessary, if it is
affirmative the conclusion will be neither necessary or assertoric; but if it is negative the
syllogism will result in a negative assertoric proposition, as above. In these also we must
understand the expression 'possible' in the conclusion in the same way as before.

First let the premises be problematic and suppose that both A and B may possibly belong to
every C. Since then the affirmative proposition is convertible into a particular, and B may
possibly belong to every C, it follows that C may possibly belong to some B. So, if A is possible
for every C, and C is possible for some of the Bs, then A is possible for some of the Bs. For we
have got the first figure. And A if may possibly belong to no C, but B may possibly belong to all
C, it follows that A may possibly not belong to some B: for we shall have the first figure again
by conversion. 

But if both premises should be negative no necessary consequence will follow
from them as they are stated, but if the premises are converted into their corresponding
affirmatives there will be a syllogism as before. For if A and B may possibly not belong to C, if
'may possibly belong' is substituted we shall again have the first figure by means of conversion.


But if one of the premises is universal, the other particular, a syllogism will be possible, or not, under the arrangement of the terms as in the case of assertoric propositions. Suppose that A may possibly belong to all C, and B to some C. We shall have the first figure again if the particular premise is converted.

For if A is possible for all C, and C for some of the Bs, then A is possible
for some of the Bs. Similarly if the proposition BC is universal. Likewise also if the proposition
AC is negative, and the proposition BC affirmative: for we shall again have the first figure by
conversion. But if both premises should be negative-the one universal and the other particularalthough no syllogistic conclusion will follow from the premises as they are put, it will follow if they are converted, as above. But when both premises are indefinite or particular, no syllogism can be formed: for A must belong sometimes to all B and sometimes to no B. To illustrate the affirmative relation take the terms animal-man-white; to illustrate the negative, take the terms horse-man-white--white being the middle term.


### Chapter 21

If one premise is pure, the other problematic, the conclusion will be problematic, not pure; and a
syllogism will be possible under the same arrangement of the terms as before. First let the
premises be affirmative: suppose that A belongs to all C, and B may possibly belong to all C. If
the proposition BC is converted, we shall have the first figure, and the conclusion that A may
possibly belong to some of the Bs. 

For when one of the premises in the first figure is
problematic, the conclusion also (as we saw) is problematic. Similarly if the proposition BC is
pure, AC problematic; or if AC is negative, Bc affirmative, no matter which of the two is pure; in
both cases the conclusion will be problematic: for the first figure is obtained once more, and it
has been proved that if one premise is problematic in that figure the conclusion also will be
problematic. But if the minor premise BC is negative, or if both premises are negative, no
syllogistic conclusion can be drawn from the premises as they stand, but if they are converted a
syllogism is obtained as before. 


If one of the premises is universal, the other particular, then when both are affirmative, or when
the universal is negative, the particular affirmative, we shall have the same sort of syllogisms: for all are completed by means of the first figure. So it is clear that we shall have not a pure but a problematic syllogistic conclusion. But if the affirmative premise is universal, the negative particular, the proof will proceed by a reductio ad impossibile. Suppose that B belongs to all C, and A may possibly not belong to some C: it follows that may possibly not belong to some B. 


For if A necessarily belongs to all B, and B (as has been assumed) belongs to all C, A will
necessarily belong to all C: for this has been proved before. But it was assumed at the outset that A may possibly not belong to some C.

Whenever both premises are indefinite or particular, no syllogism will be possible. The
demonstration is the same as was given in the case of universal premises, and proceeds by means
of the same terms.


### Chapter 22


If one of the premises is necessary, the other problematic, when the premises are affirmative a
problematic affirmative conclusion can always be drawn; when one proposition is affirmative,
the other negative, if the affirmative is necessary a problematic negative can be inferred; but if
the negative proposition is necessary both a problematic and a pure negative conclusion are
possible. But a necessary negative conclusion will not be possible, any more than in the other
figures. Suppose first that the premises are affirmative, i.e. that A necessarily belongs to all C,
and B may possibly belong to all C. Since then A must belong to all C, and C may belong to
some B, it follows that A may (not does) belong to some B: for so it resulted in the first figure. 

A similar proof may be given if the proposition BC is necessary, and AC is problematic. Again
suppose one proposition is affirmative, the other negative, the affirmative being necessary: i.e.
suppose A may possibly belong to no C, but B necessarily belongs to all C. We shall have the
first figure once more: and-since the negative premise is problematic-it is clear that the
conclusion will be problematic: for when the premises stand thus in the first figure, the
conclusion (as we found) is problematic. But if the negative premise is necessary, the conclusion
will be not only that A may possibly not belong to some B but also that it does not belong to
some B. For suppose that A necessarily does not belong to C, but B may belong to all C. If the
affirmative proposition BC is converted, we shall have the first figure, and the negative premise
is necessary. But when the premises stood thus, it resulted that A might possibly not belong to
some C, and that it did not belong to some C; consequently here it follows that A does not belong
to some B. But when the minor premise is negative, if it is problematic we shall have a syllogism
by altering the premise into its complementary affirmative, as before; but if it is necessary no
syllogism can be formed. For A sometimes necessarily belongs to all B, and sometimes cannot
possibly belong to any B. To illustrate the former take the terms sleep-sleeping horse-man; to
illustrate the latter take the terms sleep-waking horse-man.

Similar results will obtain if one of the terms is related universally to the middle, the other in
part. If both premises are affirmative, the conclusion will be problematic, not pure; and also
when one premise is negative, the other affirmative, the latter being necessary. But when the
negative premise is necessary, the conclusion also will be a pure negative proposition; for the
same kind of proof can be given whether the terms are universal or not. For the syllogisms must
be made perfect by means of the first figure, so that a result which follows in the first figure
follows also in the third. But when the minor premise is negative and universal, if it is 
problematic a syllogism can be formed by means of conversion; but if it is necessary a syllogism
is not possible. The proof will follow the same course as where the premises are universal; and
the same terms may be used.
It is clear then in this figure also when and how a syllogism can be formed, and when the
conclusion is problematic, and when it is pure. It is evident also that all syllogisms in this figure
are imperfect, and that they are made perfect by means of the first figure.
