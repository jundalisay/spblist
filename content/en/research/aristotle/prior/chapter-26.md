### Chapter 26

We understand:
- the subjects syllogisms are concerned with
- what sort of conclusion is established in each figure
- in how many moods this is done
- what sort of problem is difficult and easy to prove.

For that which is concluded in many figures and through many moods is easier; that which is concluded in few figures and through few moods is more difficult to attempt.

The universal affirmative is proved by means of the first figure only and by this in only one mood; the universal negative is proved both through the first figure and through the second, through the first in one mood, through the second in two. 

The particular affirmative is proved through the first and through the last figure, in one mood through the first, in three moods through the last. The particular negative is proved in all the figures, but once in the first, in two moods in the second, in three moods in the third. It is clear then that the universal affirmative is most difficult to establish, most easy to overthrow. 

In general, universals are easier game for the destroyer than particulars: for whether the predicate belongs to none or not to some, they are destroyed: and the particular negative is proved in all the figures, the universal negative in two. 

Similarly with universal negatives: the original statement is destroyed, whether the predicate belongs to all or to some: and this we found possible in two figures. 

But particular statements can be refuted in one way only-by proving that the predicate belongs either to all or to none.

But particular statements are easier to establish: for proof is possible in more figures and through more moods. 

In general we must not forget that it is possible to refute statements by means of one another, I mean, universal statements by means of particular, and particular statements by means of universal: but it is not possible to establish universal statements by means of particular, though it is possible to establish particular statements by means of universal. At the same time it is evident that it is easier to refute than to establish.


The manner in which every syllogism is produced, the number of the terms and premises through
which it proceeds, the relation of the premises to one another, the character of the problem
proved in each figure, and the number of the figures appropriate to each problem, all these
matters are clear from what has been said.


### Chapter 27 

How we may ourselves always have a supply of syllogisms in reference to the problem proposed and by what road we may reach the principles relative to the problem: for perhaps we ought not only to investigate the construction of syllogisms, but also to have the power of making them.

Of all the things which exist some are such that they cannot be predicated of anything else truly
and universally, e.g. Cleon and Callias, i.e. the individual and sensible, but other things may be
predicated of them (for each of these is both man and animal); and some things are themselves
predicated of others, but nothing prior is predicated of them; and some are predicated of others,
and yet others of them, e.g. man of Callias and animal of man. It is clear then that some things
are naturally not stated of anything: for as a rule each sensible thing is such that it cannot be
predicated of anything, save incidentally: for we sometimes say that that white object is Socrates, or that that which approaches is Callias. 

We shall explain in another place that there is an upward limit also to the process of predicating: for the present we must assume this. Of these ultimate predicates it is not possible to demonstrate another predicate, save as a matter of opinion, but these may be predicated of other things. Neither can individuals be predicated of other things, though other things can be predicated of them. 

Whatever lies between these limits can be spoken of in both ways: they may be stated of others, and others stated of them. And as a rule arguments and inquiries are concerned with these things. We must select the premises suitable to each problem in this manner: first we must lay down the subject and the definitions and the properties of the thing; next we must lay down those attributes which follow the thing, and again those which the thing follows, and those which cannot belong to it. 

But those to which it cannot belong need not be selected, because the negative statement implied above is convertible. 

Of the attributes which follow we must distinguish those which fall within the definition, those which are predicated as properties, and those which are predicated as accidents, and of the latter those which apparently and those which really belong. The larger the supply a man has of these, the
more quickly will he reach a conclusion; and in proportion as he apprehends those which are
truer, the more cogently will he demonstrate.

But he must select not those which follow some particular but those which follow the thing as a whole, e.g. not what follows a particular man but what follows every man: for the syllogism proceeds through universal premises. 

If the statement is indefinite, it is uncertain whether the premise is universal, but if the statement is definite, the matter is clear. 

Similarly one must select those attributes which the subject follows as wholes, for the reason given. But that which follows one must not suppose to follow as a whole, e.g. that
every animal follows man or every science music, but only that it follows, without qualification,
and indeed we state it in a proposition: for the other statement is useless and impossible, e.g. that every man is every animal or justice is all good. But that which something follows receives the mark 'every'.

Whenever the subject, for which we must obtain the attributes that follow, is
contained by something else, what follows or does not follow the highest term universally must
not be selected in dealing with the subordinate term (for these attributes have been taken in
dealing with the superior term; for what follows animal also follows man, and what does not
belong to animal does not belong to man); but we must choose those attributes which are
peculiar to each subject. 

For some things are peculiar to the species as distinct from the genus;
for species being distinct there must be attributes peculiar to each. Nor must we take as things
which the superior term follows, those things which the inferior term follows, e.g. take as
subjects of the predicate 'animal' what are really subjects of the predicate 'man'. It is necessary indeed, if animal follows man, that it should follow all these also. But these belong more properly to the choice of what concerns man.

One must apprehend also normal consequents and 
normal antecedents-, for propositions which obtain normally are established syllogistically from
premises which obtain normally, some if not all of them having this character of normality. For
the conclusion of each syllogism resembles its principles. We must not however choose
attributes which are consequent upon all the terms: for no syllogism can be made out of such
premises. The reason why this is so will be clear in the sequel.
