The second is whenever the same thing belongs to:
- all of one subject, and
- to none of another, or
 to all of each subject or to none of either.

Its middle term is that which is predicated of both subjects, by extremes the terms of which this is said, by major extreme that which lies near the middle, by minor that which is further away from the middle.

The middle term stands outside the extremes, and is first in position.

A syllogism cannot be perfect anyhow in this figure, but it may be valid whether the terms are related universally or not.

If then the terms are related universally a syllogism will be possible, whenever the middle
belongs to all of one subject and to none of another (it does not matter which has the negative
relation), but in no other way. 

Let M be predicated of no N, but of all O. Since, then, the negative relation is convertible, N will belong to no M: but M was assumed to belong to all O:
consequently N will belong to no O. 

This has already been proved. Again if M belongs to all N,
but to no O, then N will belong to no O. For if M belongs to no O, O belongs to no M: but M (as
was said) belongs to all N: O then will belong to no N: for the first figure has again been formed.

But since the negative relation is convertible, N will belong to no O. Thus it will be the same
syllogism that proves both conclusions.

It is possible to prove these results also by reductio ad impossibile.

A syllogism is formed when the terms are so related, but not a perfect syllogism.

For necessity is not perfectly established merely from the original premises; others
also are needed.

But if M is predicated of every N and O, there cannot be a syllogism. Terms to illustrate a
positive relation between the extremes are substance, animal, man; a negative relation, substance, animal, number-substance being the middle term.

Nor is a syllogism possible when M is predicated neither of any N nor of any O. Terms to
illustrate a positive relation are line, animal, man: a negative relation, line, animal, stone.
It is clear then that if a syllogism is formed when the terms are universally related, the terms
must be related as we stated at the outset: for if they are otherwise related no necessary
consequence follows.

If the middle term is related universally to one of the extremes, a particular negative syllogism
must result whenever the middle term is related universally to the major whether positively or
negatively, and particularly to the minor and in a manner opposite to that of the universal
statement: by 'an opposite manner' I mean, if the universal statement is negative, the particular is affirmative: if the universal is affirmative, the particular is negative. For if M belongs to no N, but to some O, it is necessary that N does not belong to some O. For since the negative statement is convertible, N will belong to no M: but M was admitted to belong to some O: therefore N will not belong to some O: for the result is reached by means of the first figure. Again if M belongs to all N, but not to some O, it is necessary that N does not belong to some O: for if N belongs to all O, and M is predicated also of all N, M must belong to all O: but we assumed that M does not belong to some O. And if M belongs to all N but not to all O, we shall conclude that N does not belong to all O: the proof is the same as the above. But if M is predicated of all O, but not of all N, there will be no syllogism. Take the terms animal, substance, raven; animal, white, raven. Nor will there be a conclusion when M is predicated of no O, but of some N. 

Terms to illustrate a positive relation between the extremes are animal, substance, unit: a negative relation, animal, substance, science.

If then the universal statement is opposed to the particular, we have stated when a syllogism will
be possible and when not: but if the premises are similar in form, I mean both negative or both
affirmative, a syllogism will not be possible anyhow. First let them be negative, and let the major premise be universal, e.g. let M belong to no N, and not to some O. It is possible then for N to belong either to all O or to no O. 

Terms to illustrate the negative relation are black, snow,
animal. But it is not possible to find terms of which the extremes are related positively and
universally, if M belongs to some O, and does not belong to some O. For if N belonged to all O,
but M to no N, then M would belong to no O: but we assumed that it belongs to some O. In this
way then it is not admissible to take terms: our point must be proved from the indefinite nature of
the particular statement. For since it is true that M does not belong to some O, even if it belongs
to no O, and since if it belongs to no O a syllogism is (as we have seen) not possible, clearly it
will not be possible now either.

Again let the premises be affirmative, and let the major premise as before be universal, e.g. let M
belong to all N and to some O. It is possible then for N to belong to all O or to no O. Terms to
illustrate the negative relation are white, swan, stone. But it is not possible to take terms to
illustrate the universal affirmative relation, for the reason already stated: the point must be
proved from the indefinite nature of the particular statement. But if the minor premise is
universal, and M belongs to no O, and not to some N, it is possible for N to belong either to all O or to no O.

Terms for the positive relation are white, animal, raven: for the negative relation,
white, stone, raven. If the premises are affirmative, terms for the negative relation are white,
animal, snow; for the positive relation, white, animal, swan. Evidently then, whenever the
premises are similar in form, and one is universal, the other particular, a syllogism can, not be
formed anyhow. 

Nor is one possible if the middle term belongs to some of each of the extremes,
or does not belong to some of either, or belongs to some of the one, not to some of the other, or
belongs to neither universally, or is related to them indefinitely. Common terms for all the above
are white, animal, man: white, animal, inanimate. It is clear then from what has been said that if
the terms are related to one another in the way stated, a syllogism results of necessity; and if
there is a syllogism, the terms must be so related. But it is evident also that all the syllogisms in this figure are imperfect: for all are made perfect by certain supplementary statements, which either are contained in the terms of necessity or are assumed as hypotheses, i.e. when we prove per impossibile. 

An affirmative conclusion is not attained by means of this
figure, but all are negative, whether universal or particular.
