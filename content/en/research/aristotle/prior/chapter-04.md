### Chapter 4

How are syllogisms produced?

Syllogism should be discussed before demonstration because syllogism is the general. The demonstration is a sort of syllogism, but not every syllogism is a demonstration.

<!-- Whenever 3 terms are related to one another that  as in a
whole, and  as in or from a whole,   -->

A perfect syllogism is when its 3 inter-related terms, the extremes must be related by:
- the last which is contained in the middle 
- the middle which is either contained in, or excluded from, the first

The middle term is itself contained in another and contains another in itself.

In position also this comes in the middle. By extremes I mean both that term which is itself contained in another and that in which another is contained. 

If A is predicated of all B, and B of all C, A must be predicated of all C: we have already explained what we mean by 'predicated of all'. Similarly also, if A is predicated of no B, and B of all C, it is necessary that no C will be A.

But if the first term belongs to all the middle, but the middle to none of the last term, there will be no syllogism in respect of the extremes; for nothing necessary follows from the terms being so related; for it is possible that the first should belong either to all or to none of the last, so that neither a particular nor a universal conclusion is necessary.

But if there is no necessary consequence, there cannot be a syllogism by means of these premises.

As an example of a universal affirmative relation between the extremes we may take the terms animal, man, horse; of a universal negative relation, the terms animal, man, stone. 

Nor again can syllogism be formed
when neither the first term belongs to any of the middle, nor the middle to any of the last. As an
example of a positive relation between the extremes take the terms science, line, medicine: of a
negative relation science, line, unit.

If then the terms are universally related, it is clear in this figure when a syllogism will be
possible and when not, and that if a syllogism is possible the terms must be related as described,
and if they are so related there will be a syllogism. 

But if one term is related universally, the other in part only, to its subject, there must be a perfect syllogism whenever universality is posited with reference to the major term either affirmatively or negatively, and particularity with reference to the minor term affirmatively: but whenever the universality is posited in relation to the minor term, or the terms are related in any other way, a syllogism is impossible.

I call that term the major in which the middle is contained and that term the minor which comes under the middle. Let all B be A and some C be B. Then if 'predicated of all' means what was said above, it is necessary that some C is A. And if no B is A but some C is B, it is necessary that some C is not A. The meaning of 'predicated of none' has also been defined. 

So there will be a perfect syllogism. This holds good also if the premise BC should be indefinite, provided that it is affirmative: for we shall have the same syllogism whether the
premise is indefinite or particular.

But if the universality is posited with respect to the minor term either affirmatively or negatively, a syllogism will not be possible, whether the major premise is positive or negative, indefinite or particular: e.g. if some B is or is not A, and all C is B. As an example of a positive relation between the extremes take the terms good, state, wisdom: of a negative relation, good, state, ignorance.

Again if no C is B, but some B is or is not A or not every B is A, there cannot be a
syllogism. Take the terms white, horse, swan: white, horse, raven. The same terms may be taken
also if the premise BA is indefinite.

Nor when the major premise is universal, whether affirmative or negative, and the minor premise
is negative and particular, can there be a syllogism, whether the minor premise be indefinite or
particular: e.g. if all B is A and some C is not B, or if not all C is B. 

For the major term may be predicable both of all and of none of the minor, to some of which the middle term cannot be attributed.

Suppose the terms are animal, man, white: next take some of the white things of
which man is not predicated-swan and snow: animal is predicated of all of the one, but of none
of the other. 

Consequently there cannot be a syllogism. Again let no B be A, but let some C not
be B.

Take the terms inanimate, man, white: then take some white things of which man is not
predicated-swan and snow: the term inanimate is predicated of all of the one, of none of the
other.

Further since it is indefinite to say some C is not B, and it is true that some C is not B, whether
no C is B, or not all C is B, and since if terms are assumed such that no C is B, no syllogism
follows (this has already been stated) it is clear that this arrangement of terms will not afford a
syllogism: otherwise one would have been possible with a universal negative minor premise. A
similar proof may also be given if the universal premise is negative.

Nor can there in any way be a syllogism if both the relations of subject and predicate are
particular, either positively or negatively, or the one negative and the other affirmative, or one
indefinite and the other definite, or both indefinite. Terms common to all the above are animal,
white, horse: animal, white, stone.

If there is a syllogism in this figure with a particular conclusion, the terms must be related as we have stated: if they are related otherwise, no syllogism is possible anyhow. It is evident also that all the syllogisms in this figure are perfect (for they are all completed by means of the premises originally taken) and that all conclusions are proved by this figure, viz. universal and particular, affirmative and negative. Such a figure I call the first.
