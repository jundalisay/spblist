<!-- WE have treated of that which is primarily and to which all the other categories of being are referred-i.e. of substance. 

For it is in virtue of the concept of substance that the others also are said to be-quantity and quality and the like; for all will be found to involve the concept of substance, as we said in the first part of our work.  -->

'Being' is used in 2 senses:

1. As an individual thing, quality, and quantity
2. As potency and complete reality, and of function

But what is potency and complete reality?

Potentiality and actuality extend beyond motion. 
 <!-- the cases that involve a reference to motion.  -->
- There other kinds of potency. 

<!-- But when we have spoken of this first kind, we shall in our discussions of actuality' explain the other kinds of potency as well. -->

'Potentiality' and the word 'can' have several senses. 


There are potentialities that are based on an equivocation or analogy.
- For example in geometry, we say one thing is or is not a 'power' of another because of the presence or absence of some relation between them.
<!-- For some are called so by analogy, as in   the same type are -->
- I avoid such potentialities.


I accept all the potentialies that conform to originative sources of some kind.

These are called "potencies in reference to one primary kind of potency".
- This primary potency is an originative source of change in another thing or in the thing itself qua other. 

Such potencies are of different kinds:

1. A potentiality of being acted on

This is when the source passively changes when it is acted on. 

 <!-- originative source, in the very thing acted on, is passively changed by another thing or by itself. -->

 <!-- qua other.  -->

2. A potentiality of being not susceptibile to change for the worse 

This is when the source resists destruction by another thing or by itself.

 <!-- qua other -->
 <!-- by virtue of an originative source of change.  -->

These imply the formula of potentialities in the primary sense.

These so-called potentialities are potentialities either of:
- passively acting or
- passively being acted on, or
- actively acting or
- actively being acted on

In the formulae of the "active", the formulae of the "passive" kinds of potency are implied.

A thing may be 'capable' either because:
- it can itself be acted on or
- something else can be acted on by it

And so, the potentiality of acting and of being acted on is the same but different. 

<!-- one but in a sense the potencies are different. -->


The potentiality of being acted on is in the thing acted on.
- This thing has a certain originative source

The matter is an originative source. This is why:
- the thing acted on is acted on
- one thing is acted on by one thing
- another thing is acted on by another

An oily thing can be burnt. A yielding thing can be crushed.

But the other potentiality is in the agent. For example:
- heat is present in a thing which can produce heat
- the art of building is present in the man who can build

In terms of a thing being an organic unity, it cannot be acted on by itself.
- This is because it is one and not 2 different things. 


### Privation

'Impotence' and 'impotent' are the privation which is contrary to potency of this sort, so that every potency belongs to the same subject and refers to the same process as a corresponding impotence. 

Privation has several senses. It means:

1. that which has not a certain quality 
2. that which might naturally have it but has not it, either 
  - in general or 
  - when it might naturally have it, and either 
    - in some particular way, e.g. when it has not it completely, or
    - when it has not it at all. And in certain cases if things which naturally have a quality lose it by violence, we say they have suffered privation.
