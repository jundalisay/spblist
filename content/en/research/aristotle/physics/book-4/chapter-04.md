What then after all is place? 

Let us take for granted about it the various characteristics which are supposed correctly to belong to it essentially. 

I assume:

1. Place is what contains that of which it is the place.
2. Place is no part of the thing.
3. The immediate place of a thing is neither less nor greater than the thing.
4. Place can be left behind by the thing and is separable.
5. All place admits of the distinction of up and down, and each of the bodies is naturally carried to its appropriate place and rests there, and this makes the place either up or down.

<!-- Having laid these foundations, we must complete the theory.  -->

We should try to make our investigation such as will render an account of place, and will not only solve the difficulties connected with it, but will also show that the attributes supposed to belong to it do really belong to it, and further will make clear the cause of the trouble and of the difficulties about it. Such is the most satisfactory kind of exposition.

Place would not have been thought of, if there had not been a special kind of motion, namely that with respect to place. 

It is chiefly for this reason that we suppose the heaven also to be in place, because it is in constant movement. Of this kind of change there are two species-locomotion on the one hand and, on the other, increase and diminution. 

For these too involve variation of place:

what was then in this place has now in turn changed to what is larger or smaller.

Again, when we say a thing is ‘moved’, the predicate either (1) belongs to it actually, in virtue of its own nature, or (2) in virtue of something conjoined with it. In the latter case it may be either (a) something which by its own nature is capable of being moved, e.g. the parts of the body or the nail in the ship, or (b) something which is not in itself capable of being moved, but is always moved through its conjunction with something else, as ‘whiteness’ or ‘science’. These have changed their place only because the
subjects to which they belong do so.

We say that a thing is in the world, in the sense of in place, because it is in the air, and
the air is in the world; and when we say it is in the air, we do not mean it is in every part
of the air, but that it is in the air because of the outer surface of the air which surrounds
it; for if all the air were its place, the place of a thing would not be equal to the thingwhich it is supposed to be, and which the primary place in which a thing is actually is.

When what surrounds, then, is not separate from the thing, but is in continuity with it, the thing is said to be in what surrounds it, not in the sense of in place, but as a part in a whole.

But when the thing is separate and in contact, it is immediately ‘in’ the inner surface of the surrounding body, and this surface is neither a part of what is in it nor yet greater than its extension, but equal to it; for the extremities of things which touch are coincident.

Further, if one body is in continuity with another, it is not moved in that but with that.
On the other hand it is moved in that if it is separate. It makes no difference whether
what contains is moved or not.

Again, when it is not separate it is described as a part in a whole, as the pupil in the eye
or the hand in the body: when it is separate, as the water in the cask or the wine in the
jar. For the hand is moved with the body and the water in the cask.
It will now be plain from these considerations what place is. There are just four things
of which place must be one-the shape, or the matter, or some sort of extension between
the bounding surfaces of the containing body, or this boundary itself if it contains no
extension over and above the bulk of the body which comes to be in it.

Three of these it obviously cannot be:

(1) The shape is supposed to be place because it surrounds, for the
extremities of what contains and of what is contained are
coincident. Both the shape and the place, it is true, are boundaries.

But not of the same thing: the form is the boundary of the thing,
the place is the boundary of the body which contains it.

(2) The extension between the extremities is thought to be something, because what is contained and separate may often be changed while the container remains the same (as water may be poured from a vessel)-the assumption being that the extension is something over and
above the body displaced. But there is no such extension. One of the bodies which
change places and are naturally capable of being in contact with the container falls in
whichever it may chance to be.

If there were an extension which were such as to exist independently and be permanent,
there would be an infinity of places in the same thing. For when the water and the air
change places, all the portions of the two together will play the same part in the whole
which was previously played by all the water in the vessel; at the same time the place
too will be undergoing change; so that there will be another place which is the place of
the place, and many places will be coincident. There is not a different place of the part,
in which it is moved, when the whole vessel changes its place: it is always the same: for
it is in the (proximate) place where they are that the air and the water (or the parts of the
water) succeed each other, not in that place in which they come to be, which is part of
the place which is the place of the whole world.

(3) The matter, too, might seem to be place, at least if we consider
it in what is at rest and is thus separate but in continuity. 

For just
as in change of quality there is something which was formerly
black and is now white, or formerly soft and now hard-this is just
why we say that the matter exists-so place, because it presents a
similar phenomenon, is thought to exist-only in the one case we
say so because what was air is now water, in the other because
where air formerly was there a is now water. But the matter, as we
said before, is neither separable from the thing nor contains it,
whereas place has both characteristics.

Well, then, if place is none of the three-neither the form nor the matter nor an extension
which is always there, different from, and over and above, the extension of the thing
which is displaced-place necessarily is the one of the four which is left, namely, the
boundary of the containing body at which it is in contact with the contained body. (By
the contained body is meant what can be moved by way of locomotion.) Place is thought
to be something important and hard to grasp, both because the matter and the shape
present themselves along with it, and because the displacement of the body that is
moved takes place in a stationary container, for it seems possible that there should be an
interval which is other than the bodies which are moved. The air, too, which is thought
to be incorporeal, contributes something to the belief: it is not only the boundaries of the vessel which seem to be place, but also what is between them, regarded as empty. 

Just, in fact, as the vessel is transportable place, so place is a non-portable vessel. So when
what is within a thing which is moved, is moved and changes its place, as a boat on a
river, what contains plays the part of a vessel rather than that of place. Place on the
other hand is rather what is motionless: so it is rather the whole river that is place,
because as a whole it is motionless.

Hence we conclude that the innermost motionless boundary of what contains is place.
This explains why the middle of the heaven and the surface which faces us of the
rotating system are held to be ‘up’ and ‘down’ in the strict and fullest sense for all men:
for the one is always at rest, while the inner side of the rotating body remains always
coincident with itself. Hence since the light is what is naturally carried up, and the heavy
what is carried down, the boundary which contains in the direction of the middle of the
universe, and the middle itself, are down, and that which contains in the direction of the
outermost part of the universe, and the outermost part itself, are up.

For this reason, too, place is thought to be a kind of surface, and as it were a vessel, i.e.
a container of the thing.

Further, place is coincident with the thing, for boundaries are coincident with the
bounded.
