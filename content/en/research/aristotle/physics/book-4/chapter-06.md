Does void exist? 

How does it exist? What is it? 

This is the same as our questions about place.

The views taken of it involve arguments both for and against, in much the same sort of way. 

For those who hold that the void exists regard it as a sort of place or vessel
which is supposed to be ‘full’ when it holds the bulk which it is capable of containing,
‘void’ when it is deprived of that-as if ‘void’ and ‘full’ and ‘place’ denoted the same
thing, though the essence of the three is different.

We must begin the inquiry by putting down the account given by those who say that it
exists, then the account of those who say that it does not exist, and third the current view
on these questions.

Those who try to show that the void does not exist do not disprove what people really
mean by it, but only their erroneous way of speaking; this is true of Anaxagoras and of
those who refute the existence of the void in this way. They merely give an ingenious
demonstration that air is something—by straining wineskins and showing the resistance
of the air, and by cutting it off in clepsydras.

But people really mean that there is an empty interval in which there is no sensible
body. They hold that everything which is in body is body and say that what has nothing
in it at all is void (so what is full of air is void). It is not then the existence of air that
needs to be proved, but the non-existence of an interval, different from the bodies, either
separable or actual-an interval which divides the whole body so as to break its
continuity, as Democritus and Leucippus hold, and many other physicists-or even
perhaps as something which is outside the whole body, which remains continuous.
These people, then, have not reached even the threshold of the problem, but rather those
who say that the void exists.

(1) They argue, for one thing, that change in place (i.e. locomotion and increase) would
not be. For it is maintained that motion would seem not to exist, if there were no void,
since what is full cannot contain anything more. If it could, and there were two bodies in
the same place, it would also be true that any number of bodies could be together; for it
is impossible to draw a line of division beyond which the statement would become
untrue. If this were possible, it would follow also that the smallest body would contain
the greatest; for ‘many a little makes a mickle’: thus if many equal bodies can be
together, so also can many unequal bodies.

Melissus, indeed, infers from these considerations that the All is immovable; for if it
were moved there must, he says, be void, but void is not among the things that exist.

This argument, then, is one way in which they show that there is a void.

(2) They reason from the fact that some things are observed to contract and be
compressed, as people say that a cask will hold the wine which formerly filled
it, along with the skins into which the wine has been decanted, which implies that the
compressed body contracts into the voids present in it.

Again (3) increase, too, is thought to take always by means of void, for nutriment is
body, and it is impossible for two bodies to be together. A proof of this they find also in
what happens to ashes, which absorb as much water as the empty vessel.
The Pythagoreans, too, (4) held that void exists and that it enters the heaven itself,
which as it were inhales it, from the infinite air. 

It is the void which distinguishes the natures of things, as if it were like what separates and distinguishes the terms of a series. This holds primarily in the numbers, for the void distinguishes their
nature.

These, then, and so many, are the main grounds on which people have argued for and
against the existence of the void.
