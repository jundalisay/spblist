Time does not exist without change.

When the state of our own minds does not change at all, or we have not noticed its changing, we do not realize that time has elapsed, any more than those who are fabled to sleep among the heroes in Sardinia do
when they are awakened; for they connect the earlier ‘now’ with the later and make them
one, cutting out the interval because of their failure to notice it. 

So, just as, if the ‘now’ were not different but one and the same, there would not have been time, so too when its difference escapes our notice the interval does not seem to be time. If, then, the nonrealization of the existence of time happens to us when we do not distinguish any change, but the soul seems to stay in one indivisible state, and when we perceive and distinguish we say time has elapsed, evidently time is not independent of movement and change.

Time is neither movement nor independent of movement.

We must take this as our starting-point and try to discover-since we wish to know what
time is-what exactly it has to do with movement.

Now we perceive movement and time together: for even when it is dark and we are not
being affected through the body, if any movement takes place in the mind we at once
suppose that some time also has elapsed; and not only that but also, when some time is
thought to have passed, some movement also along with it seems to have taken place.

Hence time is either movement or something that belongs to movement. Since then it is
not movement, it must be the other.

But what is moved is moved from something to something, and all magnitude is
continuous. Therefore the movement goes with the magnitude. Because the magnitude is
continuous, the movement too must be continuous, and if the movement, then the time;
for the time that has passed is always thought to be in proportion to the movement.

The distinction of ‘before’ and ‘after’ holds primarily, then, in place; and there in virtue
of relative position. Since then ‘before’ and ‘after’ hold in magnitude, they must hold
also in movement, these corresponding to those.

But also in time the distinction of
‘before’ and ‘after’ must hold, for time and movement always correspond with each
other. The ‘before’ and ‘after’ in motion is identical in substratum with motion yet
differs from it in definition, and is not identical with motion.

But we apprehend time only when we have marked motion, marking it by ‘before’ and
‘after’; and it is only when we have perceived ‘before’ and ‘after’ in motion that we say
that time has elapsed. 

We mark them by judging that A and B are different, and
that some third thing is intermediate to them. When we think of the extremes as different
from the middle and the mind pronounces that the ‘nows’ are two, one before and one
after, it is then that we say that there is time, and this that we say is time. For what is
bounded by the ‘now’ is thought to be time-we may assume this.

When, therefore, we perceive the ‘now’ one, and neither as before and after in a motion
nor as an identity but in relation to a ‘before’ and an ‘after’, no time is thought to have
elapsed, because there has been no motion either. On the other hand, when we do
perceive a ‘before’ and an ‘after’, then we say that there is time. For time is just thisnumber of motion in respect of ‘before’ and ‘after’.

Hence time is not movement, but only movement in so far as it admits of enumeration.

A proof of this: we discriminate the more or the less by number, but more or less movement by time. Time then is a kind of number. (Number, we must note, is used in two senses-both of what is counted or the countable and also of that with which we count.

Time obviously is what is counted, not that with which we count: there are
different kinds of thing.) Just as motion is a perpetual succession, so also is time. But
every simultaneous time is self-identical; for the ‘now’ as a subject is an identity, but it
accepts different attributes. The ‘now’ measures time, in so far as time involves the
‘before and after’.

The ‘now’ in one sense is the same, in another it is not the same. In so far as it is in
succession, it is different (which is just what its being was supposed to mean), but its
substratum is an identity: for motion, as was said, goes with magnitude, and time, as we
maintain, with motion. Similarly, then, there corresponds to the point the body which is
carried along, and by which we are aware of the motion and of the ‘before and after’
involved in it. 

This is an identical substratum (whether a point or a stone or something
else of the kind), but it has different attributes as the sophists assume that Coriscus’
being in the Lyceum is a different thing from Coriscus’ being in the market-place. And
the body which is carried along is different, in so far as it is at one time here and at
another there.

But the ‘now’ corresponds to the body that is carried along, as time
corresponds to the motion. For it is by means of the body that is carried along that we
become aware of the ‘before and after’ the motion, and if we regard these as countable
we get the ‘now’. Hence in these also the ‘now’ as substratum remains the same (for it
is what is before and after in movement), but what is predicated of it is different; for it is
in so far as the ‘before and after’ is numerable that we get the ‘now’.

This is what is
most knowable: for, similarly, motion is known because of that which is moved,
locomotion because of that which is carried. what is carried is a real thing, the
movement is not. Thus what is called ‘now’ in one sense is always the same; in another
it is not the same: for this is true also of what is carried.

Clearly, too, if there were no time, there would be no ‘now’, and vice versa.
just as the moving body and its locomotion involve each other mutually, so too do the
number of the moving body and the number of its locomotion. For the number of the
locomotion is time, while the ‘now’ corresponds to the moving body, and is like the unit
of number.

Time, then, also is both made continuous by the ‘now’ and divided at it. For here too
there is a correspondence with the locomotion and the moving body. For the motion or
locomotion is made one by the thing which is moved, because it is one-not because it is
one in its own nature (for there might be pauses in the movement of such a thing)-but
because it is one in definition: for this determines the movement as ‘before’ and ‘after’.
Here, too there is a correspondence with the point; for the point also both connects and
terminates the length-it is the beginning of one and the end of another. But when you
take it in this way, using the one point as two, a pause is necessary, if the same point is
to be the beginning and the end. The ‘now’ on the other hand, since the body carried is
moving, is always different.

Hence time is not number in the sense in which there is ‘number’ of the same point
because it is beginning and end, but rather as the extremities of a line form a number,
and not as the parts of the line do so, both for the reason given (for we can use the
middle point as two, so that on that analogy time might stand still), and further because
obviously the ‘now’ is no part of time nor the section any part of the movement, any
more than the points are parts of the line-for it is two lines that are parts of one line.
In so far then as the ‘now’ is a boundary, it is not time, but an attribute of it; in so far as
it numbers, it is number; for boundaries belong only to that which they bound, but
number (e.g. ten) is the number of these horses, and belongs also elsewhere.

Time is ‘number of movement in respect of the before and after’, and is continuous since it is an attribute of what is continuous.
