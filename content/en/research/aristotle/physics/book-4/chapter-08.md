There is no void existing separately, as some maintain. 

If each of the simple bodies has a natural locomotion, e.g. fire upward and earth downward and towards the middle of the universe, it is clear that it cannot be the void that is the condition of locomotion. What, then, will the void be the condition of? It is thought to be the condition of movement in respect of place, and it is not the condition of this. 

Again, if void is a sort of place deprived of body, when there is a void where will a body placed in it move to?

It cannot move into the whole of the void. The same argument applies as against those who think that place is something separate, into which things are carried; viz. how will what is placed in it move, or rest? Much the
same argument will apply to the void as to the ‘up’ and ‘down’ in place, as is natural
enough since those who maintain the existence of the void make it a place.

How will things be present either in place-or in the void? For the expected result does not take place when a body is placed as a whole in a place conceived of as separate and permanent; for a part of it, unless it be placed apart, will not be in a place
but in the whole. 

Further, if separate place does not exist, neither will void.

If people say that the void must exist, as being necessary if there is to be movement,
what rather turns out to be the case, if one the matter, is the opposite, that not a single
thing can be moved if there is a void; for as with those who for a like reason say the
earth is at rest, so, too, in the void things must be at rest; for there is no place to which
things can move more or less than to another; since the void in so far as it is void admits
no difference.

The second reason is this: all movement is either compulsory or according to nature, and
if there is compulsory movement there must also be natural (for compulsory movement
is contrary to nature, and movement contrary to nature is posterior to that according to
nature, so that if each of the natural bodies has not a natural movement, none of the
other movements can exist); but how can there be natural movement if there is no
difference throughout the void or the infinite? 

For in so far as it is infinite, there will be
no up or down or middle, and in so far as it is a void, up differs no whit from down; for
as there is no difference in what is nothing, there is none in the void (for the void seems
to be a non-existent and a privation of being), but natural locomotion seems to be
differentiated, so that the things that exist by nature must be differentiated. Either, then,
nothing has a natural locomotion, or else there is no void.

Further, in point of fact things that are thrown move though that which gave them their
impulse is not touching them, either by reason of mutual replacement, as some maintain,
or because the air that has been pushed pushes them with a movement quicker than the
natural locomotion of the projectile wherewith it moves to its proper place. But in a
void none of these things can take place, nor can anything be moved save as that which
is carried is moved.

Further, no one could say why a thing once set in motion should stop anywhere; for why
should it stop here rather than here? So that a thing will either be at rest or must be
moved ad infinitum, unless something more powerful get in its way.

Further, things are now thought to move into the void because it yields; but in a void
this quality is present equally everywhere, so that things should move in all directions.

Further, the truth of what we assert is plain from the following considerations. We see
the same weight or body moving faster than another for two reasons, either because there is a difference in what it moves through, as between water, air, and earth, or
because, other things being equal, the moving body differs from the other owing to
excess of weight or of lightness.

Now the medium causes a difference because it impedes the moving thing, most of all if
it is moving in the opposite direction, but in a secondary degree even if it is at rest; and
especially a medium that is not easily divided, i.e. a medium that is somewhat dense. 

A, then, will move through B in time G, and through D, which is thinner, in time E (if the
length of B is egual to D), in proportion to the density of the hindering body. For let B
be water and D air; then by so much as air is thinner and more incorporeal than water, A
will move through D faster than through B. 

Let the speed have the same ratio to the
speed, then, that air has to water. Then if air is twice as thin, the body will traverse B in
twice the time that it does D, and the time G will be twice the time E. And always, by so
much as the medium is more incorporeal and less resistant and more easily divided, the
faster will be the movement.

Now there is no ratio in which the void is exceeded by body, as there is no ratio of 0 to a
number. For if 4 exceeds 3 by 1, and 2 by more than 1, and 1 by still more than it
exceeds 2, still there is no ratio by which it exceeds 0; for that which exceeds must be
divisible into the excess + that which is exceeded, so that will be what it exceeds 0 by +
0. For this reason, too, a line does not exceed a point unless it is composed of points!
Similarly the void can bear no ratio to the full, and therefore neither can movement
through the one to movement through the other, but if a thing moves through the
thickest medium such and such a distance in such and such a time, it moves through the
void with a speed beyond any ratio.

For let Z be void, equal in magnitude to B and to D. Then if A is to traverse and move
through it in a certain time, H, a time less than E, however, the void will bear this ratio
to the full. But in a time equal to H, A will traverse the part O of A. And it will surely
also traverse in that time any substance Z which exceeds air in thickness in the ratio
which the time E bears to the time H. For if the body Z be as much thinner than D as E
exceeds H, A, if it moves through Z, will traverse it in a time inverse to the speed of the
movement, i.e. in a time equal to H. If, then, there is no body in Z, A will traverse Z still
more quickly. But we supposed that its traverse of Z when Z was void occupied the time
H. So that it will traverse Z in an equal time whether Z be full or void. But this is
impossible. It is plain, then, that if there is a time in which it will move through any part
of the void, this impossible result will follow: it will be found to traverse a certain
distance, whether this be full or void, in an equal time; for there will be some body
which is in the same ratio to the other body as the time is to the time.

To sum the matter up, the cause of this result is obvious, viz. that between any two
movements there is a ratio (for they occupy time, and there is a ratio between any two
times, so long as both are finite), but there is no ratio of void to full.

These are the consequences that result from a difference in the media; the following
depend upon an excess of one moving body over another. We see that bodies which
have a greater impulse either of weight or of lightness, if they are alike in other respects,
move faster over an equal space, and in the ratio which their magnitudes bear to each
other. Therefore they will also move through the void with this ratio of speed. 

But that
is impossible; for why should one move faster? (In moving through plena it must be so;
for the greater divides them faster by its force. For a moving thing cleaves the medium either by its shape, or by the impulse which the body that is carried along or is projected possesses.) Therefore all will possess equal velocity. But this is impossible.

It is evident from what has been said, then, that, if there is a void, a result follows which
is the very opposite of the reason for which those who believe in a void set it up. They think that if movement in respect of place is to exist, the void cannot exist, separated all by itself; but this is the same as to say that place is a separate cavity; and this has
already been stated to be impossible.

But even if we consider it on its own merits the so-called vacuum will be found to be
really vacuous. For as, if one puts a cube in water, an amount of water equal to the cube
will be displaced; so too in air; but the effect is imperceptible to sense. And indeed
always in the case of any body that can be displaced, must, if it is not compressed, be
displaced in the direction in which it is its nature to be displaced-always either down, if
its locomotion is downwards as in the case of earth, or up, if it is fire, or in both
directions-whatever be the nature of the inserted body. Now in the void this is
impossible; for it is not body; the void must have penetrated the cube to a distance equal
to that which this portion of void formerly occupied in the void, just as if the water or
air had not been displaced by the wooden cube, but had penetrated right through it.
But the cube also has a magnitude equal to that occupied by the void; a magnitude
which, if it is also hot or cold, or heavy or light, is none the less different in essence
from all its attributes, even if it is not separable from them; I mean the volume of the
wooden cube.

So that even if it were separated from everything else and were neither
heavy nor light, it will occupy an equal amount of void, and fill the same place, as the
part of place or of the void equal to itself. How then will the body of the cube differ
from the void or place that is equal to it? And if there can be two such things, why
cannot there be any number coinciding? This, then, is one absurd and impossible
implication of the theory. 

The cube will have this same volume even if it is displaced, which is an attribute possessed by all other bodies also. 

Therefore if this differs in no respect from its place, why need we assume a place for bodies over and above the volume of each, if their volume be conceived of as free from attributes? 

It contributes nothing to the situation if there is an equal interval attached to it as well.

[Further it ought to be clear by the study of moving things what sort of thing void is.

But in fact it is found nowhere in the world. For air is something, though it does not
seem to be so-nor, for that matter, would water, if fishes were made of iron; for the
discrimination of the tangible is by touch.] It is clear, then, from these considerations
that there is no separate void.
