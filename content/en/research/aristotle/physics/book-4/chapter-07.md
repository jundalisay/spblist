<!-- As a step towards settling which view is true, we must determine the meaning of the
name. -->

The void is place with nothing in it. 

The reason for this is that people take
what exists to be body, and hold that while every body is in place, void is place in which
there is no body, so that where there is no body, there must be void.

Every body, again, they suppose to be tangible; and of this nature is whatever has
weight or lightness.

Hence, by a syllogism, what has nothing heavy or light in it, is void.

This result, then, as I have said, is reached by syllogism. It would be absurd to suppose
that the point is void; for the void must be place which has in it an interval in tangible
body.

But at all events we observe then that in one way the void is described as what is not
full of body perceptible to touch; and what has heaviness and lightness is perceptible to
touch. So we would raise the question: what would they say of an interval that has
colour or sound-is it void or not? Clearly they would reply that if it could receive what is
tangible it was void, and if not, not.

In another way void is that in which there is no ‘this’ or corporeal substance.
So some say that the void is the matter of the body (they identify the place, too, with
this), and in this they speak incorrectly; for the matter is not separable from the things,
but they are inquiring about the void as about something separable.

Since we have determined the nature of place, and void must, if it exists, be place
deprived of body, and we have stated both in what sense place exists and in what sense
it does not, it is plain that on this showing void does not exist, either unseparated or
separated; the void is meant to be, not body but rather an interval in body. This is why
the void is thought to be something, viz. because place is, and for the same reasons. For
the fact of motion in respect of place comes to the aid both of those who maintain that
place is something over and above the bodies that come to occupy it, and of those who
maintain that the void is something.

They state that the void is the condition of movement in the sense of that in which
movement takes place; and this would be the kind of thing that some say place is.
But there is no necessity for there being a void if there is movement. It is not in the least
needed as a condition of movement in general, for a reason which, incidentally, escaped
Melissus; viz. that the full can suffer qualitative change.

But not even movement in respect of place involves a void; for bodies may
simultaneously make room for one another, though there is no interval separate and
apart from the bodies that are in movement. And this is plain even in the rotation of
continuous things, as in that of liquids.

And things can also be compressed not into a void but because they squeeze out what is
contained in them (as, for instance, when water is compressed the air
within it is squeezed out); and things can increase in size not only by the entrance of
something but also by qualitative change; e.g. if water were to be transformed into air.

In general, both the argument about increase of size and that about water poured on to
the ashes get in their own way. 

For either not any and every part of the body is
increased, or bodies may be increased otherwise than by the addition of body, or there
may be two bodies in the same place (in which case they are claiming to solve a quite
general difficulty, but are not proving the existence of void), or the whole body must be
void, if it is increased in every part and is increased by means of void. The same
argument applies to the ashes.

It is easy to refute the arguments by which they prove the existence of the void.
