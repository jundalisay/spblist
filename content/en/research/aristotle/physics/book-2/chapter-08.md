We must explain then (1) that Nature belongs to the class of causes which act for the
sake of something; (2) about the necessary and its place in physical problems, for all
writers ascribe things to this cause, arguing that since the hot and the cold, &c., are of
such and such a kind, therefore certain things necessarily are and come to be-and if they
mention any other cause (one his ‘friendship and strife’, another his ‘mind’), it is only to
touch on it, and then good-bye to it.

A difficulty presents itself: why should not nature work, not for the sake of something, nor because it is better so, but just as the sky rains, not in order to make the corn grow, but of necessity? What is drawn up must cool, and what has been cooled must become water and descend, the result of this being that the corn grows. Similarly if a man’s crop is spoiled on the threshing-floor, the rain did not fall for the sake of this-in order that the crop might be spoiled-but that result just followed. 

Why then should it not be the same
with the parts in nature, e.g. that our teeth should come up of necessity-the front teeth
sharp, fitted for tearing, the molars broad and useful for grinding down the food-since
they did not arise for this end, but it was merely a coincident result; and so with all other
parts in which we suppose that there is purpose? Wherever then all the parts came about
just what they would have been if they had come be for an end, such things survived,
being organized spontaneously in a fitting way; whereas those which grew otherwise
perished and continue to perish, as Empedocles says his ‘man-faced oxprogeny’ did.

Such are the arguments (and others of the kind) which may cause difficulty on this point.

Yet it is impossible that this should be the true view. For teeth and all other natural things either invariably or normally come about in a given way; but of not one of the results of chance or spontaneity is this true. We do not ascribe to chance or mere coincidence the frequency of rain in winter, but frequent rain in summer we do; nor heat in the dog-days, but only if we have it in winter.

If then, it is agreed that things are either the result of coincidence or for an end, and these cannot be the result of coincidence or spontaneity, it follows that they must be for an end; and that such things are all due to nature even the champions of the theory which is before us would agree. Therefore action for an end is present in things which come to be and are by nature.

Further, where a series has a completion, all the preceding steps are for the sake of that.

As in intelligent action, so in nature; and as in nature, so it is in each action,
if nothing interferes. Now intelligent action is for the sake of an end; therefore the nature
of things also is so.

Thus if a house, e.g. had been a thing made by nature, it would have been made in the same way as it is now by art; and if things made by nature were made also by art, they would come to be in the same way as by nature.

Each step then in the series is for the sake of the next; and generally art partly completes what nature cannot
bring to a finish, and partly imitates her. If, therefore, artificial products are for the sake
of an end, so clearly also are natural products. The relation of the later to the earlier
terms of the series is the same in both. This is most obvious in the animals other than
man: they make things neither by art nor after inquiry or deliberation. 

Wherefore people
discuss whether it is by intelligence or by some other faculty that these creatures
work,spiders, ants, and the like. By gradual advance in this direction we come to see
clearly that in plants too that is produced which is conducive to the endleaves, e.g. grow
to provide shade for the fruit. If then it is both by nature and for an end that the swallow
makes its nest and the spider its web, and plants grow leaves for the sake of the fruit and
send their roots down (not up) for the sake of nourishment, it is plain that this kind of cause is operative in things which come to be and are by nature.

Since ‘nature’ means two things, the matter and the form, of which the latter is the end, and since all the rest is for the sake of the end, the form must be the cause in the sense of ‘that for the
sake of which’.

Now mistakes come to pass even in the operations of art: the grammarian makes a
mistake in writing and the doctor pours out the wrong dose. Hence clearly mistakes are
possible in the operations of nature also. If then in art there are cases in which what is
rightly produced serves a purpose, and if where mistakes occur there was a purpose in
what was attempted, only it was not attained, so must it be also in natural products, and
monstrosities will be failures in the purposive effort. Thus in the original combinations
the ‘ox-progeny’ if they failed to reach a determinate end must have arisen through the
corruption of some principle corresponding to what is now the seed.
Further, seed must have come into being first, and not straightway the animals: the
words ‘whole-natured first...’ must have meant seed.

Again, in plants too we find the relation of means to end, though the degree of
organization is less. Were there then in plants also ‘olive-headed vine-progeny’, like the
‘man-headed ox-progeny’, or not? An absurd suggestion; yet there must have been, if
there were such things among animals.

Moreover, among the seeds anything must have come to be at random. But the person
who asserts this entirely does away with ‘nature’ and what exists ‘by nature’. For those
things are natural which, by a continuous movement originated from an internal
principle, arrive at some completion: the same completion is not reached from every
principle; nor any chance completion, but always the tendency in each is towards the
same end, if there is no impediment.

The end and the means towards it may come about by chance. We say, for instance, that
a stranger has come by chance, paid the ransom, and gone away, when he does so as if
he had come for that purpose, though it was not for that that he came. This is incidental,
for chance is an incidental cause, as I remarked before. But when an event takes place
always or for the most part, it is not incidental or by chance. In natural products the
sequence is invariable, if there is no impediment.

It is absurd to suppose that purpose is not present because we do not observe the agent
deliberating. Art does not deliberate. If the ship-building art were in the wood, it would
produce the same results by nature. If, therefore, purpose is present in art, it is present
also in nature. The best illustration is a doctor doctoring himself: nature is like that.
It is plain then that nature is a cause, a cause that operates for a purpose.
