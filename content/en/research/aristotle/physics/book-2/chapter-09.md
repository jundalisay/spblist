What is ‘of necessity’?

Is necessity ‘hypothetical’ or ‘simple’?

The current view places what is of necessity in the process of production, just as if one were to suppose that the wall of a house necessarily comes to be because what is heavy is naturally carried downwards and what is light to the top, wherefore the stones and foundations take the lowest place, with earth above because it is lighter, and wood at the top of all as being the lightest.

Whereas, though the wall does not come to be without these, it is not due to these, except as its material cause: it comes to be for the sake of sheltering and guarding certain things. 

Similarly in all other things which involve production for an end; the product cannot come to be without things
which have a necessary nature, but it is not due to these (except as its material); it comes
to be for an end. 

For instance, why is a saw such as it is? To effect so-and-so and for the sake of so-and-so. This end, however, cannot be realized unless the saw is made of iron. 

It is, therefore, necessary for it to be of iron, it we are to have a saw and perform the operation of sawing. What is necessary then, is necessary on a hypothesis; it is not a result necessarily determined by antecedents. Necessity is in the matter, while ‘that for
the sake of which’ is in the definition.

Necessity in mathematics is in a way similar to necessity in things which come to be
through the operation of nature. Since a straight line is what it is, it is necessary that the
angles of a triangle should equal two right angles.

But not conversely; though if the angles are not equal to two right angles, then the straight line is not what it is either. 

But in things which come to be for an end, the reverse is true. If the end is to exist or does exist, that also which precedes it will exist or does exist; otherwise just as there, if-the conclusion is not true, the premiss will not be true, so here the end or ‘that for the sake of which’ will not exist. For this too is itself a starting-point, but of the reasoning, not of the action; while in mathematics the starting-point is the starting-point of the reasoning only, as there is no action.

If then there is to be a house, such-and-such things must be made or be there already or exist, or generally the matter relative to the end, bricks and stones if it is a house.

But the end is not due to these except as the matter, nor will it come to exist because of them. Yet if they do not exist at all, neither will the house, or the saw-the former in the absence of stones, the latter in the absence of iron-just as in the other case the premisses will not be true, if the angles of the triangle are not equal to two right angles.

The necessary in nature, then, is plainly what we call by the name of matter, and the
changes in it. Both causes must be stated by the physicist, but especially the end; for
that is the cause of the matter, not vice versa; and the end is ‘that for the sake of which’,
and the beginning starts from the definition or essence; as in artificial products, since a
house is of such-and-such a kind, certain things must necessarily come to be or be there
already, or since health is this, these things must necessarily come to be or be there
already. Similarly if man is this, then these; if these, then those. Perhaps the necessary is
present also in the definition.

For if one defines the operation of sawing as being a certain kind of dividing, then this
cannot come about unless the saw has teeth of a certain kind; and these cannot be unless
it is of iron. For in the definition too there are some parts that are, as it were, its matter.
