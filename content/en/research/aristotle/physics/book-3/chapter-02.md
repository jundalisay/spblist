The soundness of this definition is evident both when we consider the accounts of motion that the others have given, and also from the difficulty of defining it otherwise. 

One could not easily put motion and change in another genus-this is plain if we consider where some people put it; they identify motion with or ‘inequality’ or ‘not being’; but such things are not necessarily moved, whether they are ‘different’ or ‘unequal’ or ‘nonexistent’; Nor is change either to or from these rather than to or from their opposites.

The reason why they put motion into these genera is that it is thought to be something
indefinite, and the principles in the second column are indefinite because they are
privative: none of them is either ‘this’ or ‘such’ or comes under any of the other modes
of predication. 

The reason in turn why motion is thought to be indefinite is that it cannot be classed simply as a potentiality or as an actuality-a thing that is merely capable of having a certain size is not undergoing change, nor yet a thing that is actually of a certain size, and motion is thought to be a sort of actuality, but incomplete, the reason for this view being that the potential whose actuality it is is incomplete. 

This is why it is hard to grasp what motion is. It is necessary to class it with privation or with
potentiality or with sheer actuality, yet none of these seems possible. There remains then
the suggested mode of definition, namely that it is a sort of actuality, or actuality of the kind described,
hard to grasp, but not incapable of existing.

The mover too is moved, as has been said-every mover, that is, which is capable of motion, and whose immobility is rest-when a thing is subject to motion its immobility is rest. For to act on the movable as such is just to move it.

But this it does by contact, so that at the same time it is also acted on. Hence we can define motion as the fulfilment of the movable qua movable, the cause of the attribute being contact with what can move so that the mover is also acted on. The mover or agent will always be the vehicle of a form, either a ‘this’ or ‘such’, which, when it acts, will be the source and cause of the change, e.g. the full-formed man begets man from what is potentially man.



### CHAPTER 3

The solution of the difficulty that is raised about the motion-whether it is in the
movable-is plain. 

It is the fulfilment of this potentiality, and by the action of that which
has the power of causing motion; and the actuality of that which has the power of
causing motion is not other than the actuality of the movable, for it must be the
fulfilment of both. A thing is capable of causing motion because it can do this, it is a
mover because it actually does it. But it is on the movable that it is capable of acting.
Hence there is a single actuality of both alike, just as one to two and two to one are the
same interval, and the steep ascent and the steep descent are one-for these are one and
the same, although they can be described in different ways. So it is with the mover and
the moved.

This view has a dialectical difficulty. Perhaps it is necessary that the actuality of the
agent and that of the patient should not be the same. The one is ‘agency’ and the other
‘patiency’; and the outcome and completion of the one is an ‘action’, that of the other a
‘passion’. Since then they are both motions, we may ask: in what are they, if they are
different? Either (a) both are in what is acted on and moved, or (b) the agency is in the
agent and the patiency in the patient. (If we ought to call the latter also ‘agency’, the
word would be used in two senses.) Now, in alternative (b), the motion will be in the
mover, for the same statement will hold of ‘mover’ and ‘moved’. Hence either every
mover will be moved, or, though having motion, it will not be moved.

If on the other hand (a) both are in what is moved and acted on-both the agency and the
patiency (e.g. both teaching and learning, though they are two, in the learner), then, first,
the actuality of each will not be present in each, and, a second absurdity, a thing will
have two motions at the same time. How will there be two alterations of quality in one
subject towards one definite quality? The thing is impossible: the actualization will be
one.

But (some one will say) it is contrary to reason to suppose that there should be one
identical actualization of two things which are different in kind. Yet there will be, if
teaching and learning are the same, and agency and patiency. To teach will be the same
as to learn, and to act the same as to be acted on-the teacher will necessarily be learning
everything that he teaches, and the agent will be acted on.
One may reply:

(1) It is not absurd that the actualization of one thing should be in another. Teaching is the activity of a person who can teach, yet the operation is performed on some patient-it is not cut adrift from a subject, but is of A on B. 

(2) There is nothing to prevent two things having one and the
same actualization, provided the actualizations are not described
in the same way, but are related as what can act to what is acting.

(3) Nor is it necessary that the teacher should learn, even if to act and to be acted on are one and the same, provided they are not the same in definition (as ‘raiment’ and ‘dress’), but are the same
merely in the sense in which the road from Thebes to Athens and
the road from Athens to Thebes are the same, as has been explained above. 

For it is not things which are in a way the same that have all their attributes the same, but only such
as have the same definition. But indeed it by no means follows from the fact that
teaching is the same as learning, that to learn is the same as to teach, any more than it
follows from the fact that there is one distance between two things which are at a distance from each other, that the two vectors AB and BA, are one and the same. 

To generalize, teaching is not the same as learning, or agency as patiency, in the full sense,
though they belong to the same subject, the motion; for the ‘actualization of X in Y’ and
the ‘actualization of Y through the action of X’ differ in definition.
What then Motion is, has been stated both generally and particularly. It is not difficult
to see how each of its types will be defined-alteration is the fulfillment of the alterable
qua alterable (or, more scientifically, the fulfilment of what can act and what can be
acted on, as such)-generally and again in each particular case, building, healing, &c. A
similar definition will apply to each of the other kinds of motion.
