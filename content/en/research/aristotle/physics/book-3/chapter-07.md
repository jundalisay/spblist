Infinity can exist from division, but not from addition. 

<!-- It is reasonable that there should not be held to be an infinite in respect of addition such
as to surpass every magnitude, but that there should be thought to be such an infinite in
the direction of division.  -->

For the matter and the infinite are contained inside what contains them, while it is the form which contains. 

It is natural too to suppose that in number there is a limit in the direction of the minimum, and that in the other direction every assigned number is surpassed. 

In magnitude, on the contrary, every assigned magnitude is surpassed in the direction of smallness, while in the other direction there is no infinite magnitude. The reason is that what is one is indivisible whatever it may be, e.g. a man is one man, not many. 

Number on the other hand is a plurality of ‘ones’ and a certain quantity of them. Hence number must stop at the indivisible: for ‘two’ and ‘three’ are merely derivative terms, and so with each of the other numbers. 

But in the direction of largeness it is always possible to think of a larger number: for the number of times a magnitude can be bisected is infinite. Hence this infinite is potential, never actual: the number of parts that can be taken always surpasses any assigned number.

But this number is not separable from the process of bisection, and its infinity is not a permanent actuality but consists in a process of coming to be, like time and the number of time.

With magnitudes the contrary holds. What is continuous is divided ad infinitum, but there is no infinite in the direction of increase. For the size which it can potentially be, it can also actually be. Hence since no sensible magnitude is infinite, it is impossible to exceed every assigned magnitude; for if it were possible there would be something bigger than the heavens.

The infinite is not the same in magnitude and movement and time, in the sense of a single nature, but its secondary sense depends on its primary sense, i.e. movement is called infinite in virtue of the magnitude covered by the movement (or alteration or growth), and time because of the movement. (I use these terms for the moment.

<!-- Later I shall explain what each of them means, and also why every magnitude is divisible into magnitudes.)  -->

My account does not rob the mathematicians of their science, by disproving the actual existence of the infinite in the direction of increase, in the sense of the untraversable. 

In point of fact they do not need the infinite and do not use it. 

They postulate only that the finite straight line may be produced as far as they wish.

It is possible to have divided in the same ratio as the largest quantity another magnitude of any size you like. Hence, for the purposes of proof, it will make no difference to them to have such an infinite instead, while its existence will be in the sphere of real magnitudes.

In the fourfold scheme of causes, it is plain that the infinite is a cause in the sense of
matter, and that its essence is privation, the subject as such being what is continuous
and sensible. All the other thinkers, too, evidently treat the infinite as matter-that is why
it is inconsistent in them to make it what contains, and not what is contained.




## Chapter 8

The idea that the infinite exists not only potentially but as a separate thing is wrong. 

Some have no cogency; others can be met by fresh objections that are valid.

1. In order that coming to be should not fail, it is not necessary that there should be a sensible body which is actually infinite. 

The passing away of one thing may be the coming to be of another, the All being limited.

2. There is a difference between touching and being limited. The former is relative to something and is the touching of something (for everything that touches touches something), and further is an attribute of some one of the things which are limited. 

On the other hand, what is limited is not limited in relation to anything. Again,
contact is not necessarily possible between any two things taken at
random.


3. To rely on mere thinking is absurd, for then the excess or defect is not in the thing but in the thought. One might think that one of us is bigger than he is and magnify him ad infinitum. 

But it does not follow that he is bigger than the size we are, just because some one thinks he is, but only because he is the size he is. The thought is an accident.

(a) Time indeed and movement are infinite, and also thinking, in the sense that each part that is taken passes in succession out of existence.

(b) Magnitude is not infinite either in the way of reduction or of magnification in thought.

This concludes my account of the way in which the infinite exists, and of the way in which it does not exist, and of what it is.
