It is impossible that the infinite should be a thing which is itself infinite, separable from sensible objects. If the infinite is neither a magnitude nor an aggregate, but is itself a substance and not an attribute, it will be indivisible; for the divisible must be either a magnitude or an aggregate. 

But if indivisible, then not infinite, except in the sense (1) in which the voice is ‘invisible’. But this is not the sense in which it is used by those who say that the infinite exists, nor that in which we are investigating it, namely as (2) ‘that which cannot be gone through’.

But if the infinite exists as an attribute, it would not be, qua infinite an element in
substances, any more than the invisible would be an element of speech, though the voice
is invisible.

Further, how can the infinite be itself any thing, unless both number and magnitude, of
which it is an essential attribute, exist in that way? If they are not substances, a fortiori
the infinite is not.

The infinite cannot be an actual thing and a substance and principle.

For any part of it that is taken will be infinite, if it has parts: for ‘to be infinite’ and ‘the
infinite’ are the same, if it is a substance and not predicated of a subject. Hence it will
be either indivisible or divisible into infinites. 

But the same thing cannot be many
infinites. (Yet just as part of air is air, so a part of the infinite would be infinite, if it is
supposed to be a substance and principle.) Therefore the infinite must be without parts
and indivisible. But this cannot be true of what is infinite in full completion: for it must
be a definite quantity.

Suppose then that infinity belongs to substance as an attribute. But, if so, it cannot, as
we have said, be described as a principle, but rather that of which it is an attribute-the
air or the even number.

Thus the view of those who speak after the manner of the Pythagoreans is absurd. With
the same breath they treat the infinite as substance, and divide it into parts.
This discussion, however, involves the more general question whether the infinite can be
present in mathematical objects and things which are intelligible and do not have
extension, as well as among sensible objects. Our inquiry (as physicists) is limited to its
special subject-matter, the objects of sense, and we have to ask whether there is or is not
among them a body which is infinite in the direction of increase.

We may begin with a dialectical argument and show as follows that there is no such
thing. If ‘bounded by a surface’ is the definition of body there cannot be an infinite body
either intelligible or sensible. Nor can number taken in abstraction be infinite, for
number or that which has number is numerable. If then the numerable can be numbered,
it would also be possible to go through the infinite.

If, on the other hand, we investigate the question more in accordance with principles
appropriate to physics, we are led as follows to the same result.
The infinite body must be either (1) compound, or (2) simple; yet neither alternative is
possible.

(1) Compound the infinite body will not be, if the elements are
finite in number. For they must be more than one, and the
contraries must always balance, and no one of them can be infinite. If one of the bodies falls in any degree short of the other in potency-suppose fire is finite in amount while air is infinite and
a given quantity of fire exceeds in power the same amount of air in
any ratio provided it is numerically definite-the infinite body will
obviously prevail over and annihilate the finite body. On the other
hand, it is impossible that each should be infinite. ‘Body’ is what
has extension in all directions and the infinite is what is
boundlessly extended, so that the infinite body would be extended
in all directions ad infinitum.

Nor (2) can the infinite body be one and simple, whether it is, as some hold, a thing over
and above the elements (from which they generate the elements) or is not thus qualified.
(a) We must consider the former alternative; for there are some
people who make this the infinite, and not air or water, in order
that the other elements may not be annihilated by the element
which is infinite. They have contrariety with each other-air is cold,
water moist, fire hot; if one were infinite, the others by now would
have ceased to be. As it is, they say, the infinite is different from
them and is their source.

It is impossible, however, that there should be such a body; not because it is infinite on
that point a general proof can be given which applies equally to all, air, water, or
anything else-but simply because there is, as a matter of fact, no such sensible body,
alongside the so-called elements. Everything can be resolved into the elements of which
it is composed. Hence the body in question would have been present in our world here,
alongside air and fire and earth and water: but nothing of the kind is observed.
(b) Nor can fire or any other of the elements be infinite. 

Generally, and apart from the question of how any of them could
be infinite, the All, even if it were limited, cannot either be or
become one of them, as Heraclitus says that at some time all things
become fire. (The same argument applies also to the one which the
physicists suppose to exist alongside the elements: for everything
changes from contrary to contrary, e.g. from hot to cold).

The preceding consideration of the various cases serves to show us whether it is or is
not possible that there should be an infinite sensible body. The following arguments
give a general demonstration that it is not possible.
It is the nature of every kind of sensible body to be somewhere, and there is a place
appropriate to each, the same for the part and for the whole, e.g. for the whole earth and
for a single clod, and for fire and for a spark.

Suppose (a) that the infinite sensible body is homogeneous. Then each part will be
either immovable or always being carried along. Yet neither is possible.
For why downwards rather than upwards or in any other direction? I mean, e.g, if you
take a clod, where will it be moved or where will it be at rest? For ex hypothesi the
place of the body akin to it is infinite. Will it occupy the whole place, then? And how?
What then will be the nature of its rest and of its movement, or where will they be? It
will either be at home everywhere-then it will not be moved; or it will be moved
everywhere-then it will not come to rest.

But if (b) the All has dissimilar parts, the proper places of the parts will be dissimilar
also, and the body of the All will have no unity except that of contact.

Then, further, the parts will be either finite or infinite in variety of kind. (i) Finite they
cannot be, for if the All is to be infinite, some of them would have to be infinite, while
the others were not, e.g. fire or water will be infinite. But, as we have seen before, such an element would destroy what is contrary to it. (This indeed is the reason why none of
the physicists made fire or earth the one infinite body, but either water or air or what is
intermediate between them, because the abode of each of the two was plainly
determinate, while the others have an ambiguous place between up and down.) But (ii)
if the parts are infinite in number and simple, their proper places too will be infinite in
number, and the same will be true of the elements themselves.
If that is impossible, and the places are finite, the whole too must be finite; for the place
and the body cannot but fit each other. Neither is the whole place larger than what can
be filled by the body (and then the body would no longer be infinite), nor is the body
larger than the place; for either there would be an empty space or a body whose nature it
is to be nowhere.

Anaxagoras gives an absurd account of why the infinite is at rest. He says that the
infinite itself is the cause of its being fixed. This because it is in itself, since nothing else
contains it-on the assumption that wherever anything is, it is there by its own nature.
But this is not true: a thing could be somewhere by compulsion, and not where it is its
nature to be.

Even if it is true as true can be that the whole is not moved (for what is fixed by itself
and is in itself must be immovable), yet we must explain why it is not its nature to be
moved. It is not enough just to make this statement and then decamp.

Anything else might be in a state of rest, but there is no reason why it should not be its
nature to be moved. The earth is not carried along, and would not be carried along if it
were infinite, provided it is held together by the centre. But it would not be because
there was no other region in which it could be carried along that it would remain at the
centre, but because this is its nature. Yet in this case also we may say that it fixes itself.
If then in the case of the earth, supposed to be infinite, it is at rest, not because it is
infinite, but because it has weight and what is heavy rests at the centre and the earth is at
the centre, similarly the infinite also would rest in itself, not because it is infinite and
fixes itself, but owing to some other cause.

Another difficulty emerges at the same time. Any part of the infinite body should remain at rest. Just as the infinite remains at rest in itself because it fixes itself, so too
any part of it you may take will remain in itself. The appropriate places of the whole and
of the part are alike, e.g. of the whole earth and of a clod the appropriate place is the
lower region; of fire as a whole and of a spark, the upper region. If, therefore, to be in
itself is the place of the infinite, that also will be appropriate to the part. Therefore it
will remain in itself.

In general, the view that there is an infinite body is plainly incompatible with the
doctrine that there is necessarily a proper place for each kind of body, if every sensible
body has either weight or lightness, and if a body has a natural locomotion towards the
centre if it is heavy, and upwards if it is light. This would need to be true of the infinite
also. But neither character can belong to it: it cannot be either as a whole, nor can it be
half the one and half the other. For how should you divide it? or how can the infinite
have the one part up and the other down, or an extremity and a centre? 

Further, every
sensible body is in place, and the kinds or differences of place are up-down, beforebehind, right-left; and these distinctions hold not only in relation to us and by arbitrary agreement, but also in the whole itself. But in the infinite body they cannot exist. 

In general, if it is impossible that there should be an infinite place, and if every body is in place, there cannot be an infinite body.

Surely what is in a special place is in place, and what is in place is in a special place.

Just, then, as the infinite cannot be quantity-that would imply that it has a particular quantity, e,g, two or three cubits; quantity just means these-so a thing’s being in place
means that it is somewhere, and that is either up or down or in some other of the six
differences of position: but each of these is a limit.
It is plain from these arguments that there is no body which is actually infinite.
