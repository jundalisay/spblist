Is every motion commensurable with every other or not?

If they are all commensurable and if two things to have the same velocity must accomplish an equal motion in an equal time, then we may have a circumference equal to a straight line, or, of course, the one may be greater or less than the other. 

If one thing alters and another accomplishes a locomotion in an equal time, we may have an alteration and a locomotion equal to one another: thus an affection will be equal to a length, which is impossible.

But is it not only when an equal motion is accomplished by two things in an equal time that the velocities of the two are equal? 

Now an affection cannot be equal to a length. Therefore there cannot be an alteration
equal to or less than a locomotion: and consequently it is not the case that every motion
is commensurable with every other.

But how will our conclusion work out in the case of the circle and the straight line? It
would be absurd to suppose that the motion of one in a circle and of another in a
straight line cannot be similar, but that the one must inevitably move more quickly or
more slowly than the other, just as if the course of one were downhill and of the other
uphill. Moreover it does not as a matter of fact make any difference to the argument to
say that the one motion must inevitably be quicker or slower than the other: for then the
circumference can be greater or less than the straight line; and if so it is possible for the
two to be equal. For if in the time A the quicker (B) passes over the distance B’ and the
slower (G) passes over the distance G’, B’ will be greater than G’: for this is what we
took ‘quicker’ to mean: and so quicker motion also implies that one thing traverses an
equal distance in less time than another: consequently there will be a part of A in which
B will pass over a part of the circle equal to G’, while G will occupy the whole of A in
passing over G’. None the less, if the two motions are commensurable, we are
confronted with the consequence stated above, viz. that there may be a straight line
equal to a circle. But these are not commensurable: and so the corresponding motions
are not commensurable either.

But may we say that things are always commensurable if the same terms are applied to
them without equivocation? e.g. a pen, a wine, and the highest note in a scale are not
commensurable: we cannot say whether any one of them is sharper than any other: and
why is this? they are incommensurable because it is only equivocally that the same term
‘sharp’ is applied to them: whereas the highest note in a scale is commensurable with
the leading-note, because the term ‘sharp’ has the same meaning as applied to both. Can
it be, then, that the term ‘quick’ has not the same meaning as applied to straight motion
and to circular motion respectively? If so, far less will it have the same meaning as
applied to alteration and to locomotion.

Or shall we in the first place deny that things are always commensurable if the same terms are applied to them without equivocation? For the term ‘much’ has the same meaning whether applied to water or to air, yet water and air are not commensurable in respect of it: or, if this illustration is not considered satisfactory, ‘double’ at any rate would seem to have the same meaning as applied to each (denoting in each case the
proportion of two to one), yet water and air are not commensurable in respect of it. But
here again may we not take up the same position and say that the term ‘much’ is
equivocal? In fact there are some terms of which even the definitions are equivocal; e.g.
if ‘much’ were defined as ‘so much and more’,’so much’ would mean something
different in different cases: ‘equal’ is similarly equivocal; and ‘one’ again is perhaps
inevitably an equivocal term; and if ‘one’ is equivocal, so is ‘two’. Otherwise why is it that some things are commensurable while others are not, if the nature of the attribute in the two cases is really one and the same? Can it be that the incommensurability of two things in respect of any attribute is due to a difference in that which is primarily capable
of carrying the attribute? Thus horse and dog are so commensurable that we may say
which is the whiter, since that which primarily contains the whiteness is the same in
both, viz. the surface: and similarly they are commensurable in respect of size. But
water and speech are not commensurable in respect of clearness, since that which
primarily contains the attribute is different in the two cases. It would seem, however that
we must reject this solution, since clearly we could thus make all equivocal attributes
univocal and say merely that that contains each of them is different in different cases:
thus ‘equality’, ‘sweetness’, and ‘whiteness’ will severally always be the same, though
that which contains them is different in different cases. Moreover, it is not any casual
thing that is capable of carrying any attribute: each single attribute can be carried
primarily only by one single thing.

Must we then say that, if two things are to be commensurable in respect of any attribute, not only must the attribute in question be applicable to both without equivocation, but there must also be no specific differences either in the attribute itself or in that which contains the attribute-that these, I mean, must not be divisible in the way in which colour is divided into kinds? Thus in this respect one thing will not be commensurable with another, i.e. we cannot say that one is more coloured than the other where only
colour in general and not any particular colour is meant; but they are commensurable in
respect of whiteness.


Similarly in the case of motion: two things are of the same velocity if they occupy an equal time in accomplishing a certain equal amount of motion. Suppose, then, that in a certain time an alteration is undergone by one half of a body’s length and a locomotion is accomplished the other half: can be say that in this case the alteration is equal to the locomotion and of the same velocity? That would be absurd, and the reason is that there are different species of motion. And if in consequence of this we must say that two
things are of equal velocity if they accomplish locomotion over an equal distance in an
equal time, we have to admit the equality of a straight line and a circumference. What,
then, is the reason of this? Is it that locomotion is a genus or that line is a genus? (We
may leave the time out of account, since that is one and the same.) If the lines are
specifically different, the locomotions also differ specifically from one another: for
locomotion is specifically differentiated according to the specific differentiation of that over which it takes place. 

(It is also similarly differentiated, it would seem, accordingly as the instrument of the locomotion is different: thus if feet are the instrument, it is walking, if wings it is flying; but perhaps we should rather say that this is not so, and that in this case the differences in the locomotion are merely differences of posture in that which is in motion.) We may say, therefore, that things are of equal velocity in an equal time they traverse the same magnitude: and when I call it ‘the same’ I mean that it contains no specific difference and therefore no difference in the motion that takes place over it. So we have now to consider how motion is differentiated: and this discussion serves to show that the genus is not a unity but contains a plurality latent in it and distinct from it, and that in the case of equivocal terms sometimes the different senses in which they are used are far removed from one another, while sometimes there is a certain likeness between them, and sometimes again they are nearly related either generically or analogically, with the result that they seem not to be equivocal though they really are.

When, then, is there a difference of species? Is an attribute specifically different if the
subject is different while the attribute is the same, or must the attribute itself be different
as well? And how are we to define the limits of a species? What will enable us to decide that particular instances of whiteness or sweetness are the same or different? Is it
enough that it appears different in one subject from what appears in another? Or must
there be no sameness at all? And further, where alteration is in question, how is one
alteration to be of equal velocity with another? One person may be cured quickly and
another slowly, and cures may also be simultaneous: so that, recovery of health being an
alteration, we have here alterations of equal velocity, since each alteration occupies an
equal time. But what alteration? We cannot here speak of an ‘equal’ alteration: what
corresponds in the category of quality to equality in the category of quantity is
‘likeness’. However, let us say that there is equal velocity where the same change is
accomplished in an equal time. Are we, then, to find the commensurability in the subject
of the affection or in the affection itself? In the case that we have just been considering it
is the fact that health is one and the same that enables us to arrive at the conclusion that
the one alteration is neither more nor less than the other, but that both are alike. If on the
other hand the affection is different in the two cases, e.g. when the alterations take the
form of becoming white and becoming healthy respectively, here there is no sameness or
equality or likeness inasmuch as the difference in the affections at once makes the
alterations specifically different, and there is no unity of alteration any more than there
would be unity of locomotion under like conditions. So we must find out how many
species there are of alteration and of locomotion respectively. Now if the things that are
in motion-that is to say, the things to which the motions belong essentially and not
accidentally-differ specifically, then their respective motions will also differ specifically:
if on the other hand they differ generically or numerically, the motions also will differ
generically or numerically as the case may be. But there still remains the question
whether, supposing that two alterations are of equal velocity, we ought to look for this
equality in the sameness (or likeness) of the affections, or in the things altered, to see
e.g. whether a certain quantity of each has become white.
Or ought we not rather to look for it in both? That is to say, the alterations are the same
or different according as the affections are the same or different, while they are equal or
unequal according as the things altered are equal or unequal.


We must consider the same question in the case of becoming and perishing:


How is one becoming of equal velocity with another? They are of equal velocity if in an
equal time there are produced two things that are the same and specifically inseparable,
e.g. two men (not merely generically inseparable as e.g. two animals). Similarly one is
quicker than the other if in an equal time the product is different in the two cases. I state
it thus because we have no pair of terms that will convey this ‘difference’ in the way in
which unlikeness is conveyed. If we adopt the theory that it is number that constitutes
being, we may indeed speak of a ‘greater number’ and a ‘lesser number’ within the same
species, but there is no common term that will include both relations, nor are there terms
to express each of them separately in the same way as we indicate a higher degree or
preponderance of an affection by ‘more’, of a quantity by ‘greater.’
