Everything that undergoes alteration is altered by sensible causes, and there is alteration only in things that are said to be essentially affected by sensible things. 

The truth of this is to be seen from the following considerations. Of all other things it would
be most natural to suppose that there is alteration in figures and shapes, and in acquired
states and in the processes of acquiring and losing these: but as a matter of fact in
neither of these two classes of things is there alteration.

In the first place, when a particular formation of a thing is completed, we do not call it by the name of its material: e.g. we do not call the statue ‘bronze’ or the pyramid ‘wax’ or the bed ‘wood’, but we use a derived expression and call them ‘of bronze’, ‘waxen’, and ‘wooden’ respectively. But when a thing has been affected and altered in any way we still call it by the original name: thus we speak of the bronze or the wax being dry or fluid or hard or hot.

And not only so: we also speak of the particular fluid or hot substance as being bronze,
giving the material the same name as that which we use to describe the affection.

Since, therefore, having regard to the figure or shape of a thing we no longer call that which has become of a certain figure by the name of the material that exhibits the figure, whereas having regard to a thing’s affections or alterations we still call it by the name of its material, it is evident that becomings of the former kind cannot be alterations. 

It would seem absurd even to speak in this way, to speak, that is to say, of a man or house or anything else that has come into existence as having been altered. 

Though it may be true that every such becoming is necessarily the result of something’s being altered, the result, e.g. of the material’s being condensed or rarefied or heated or cooled, nevertheless it is not the things that are coming into existence that are altered, and their becoming is not an alteration.

Acquired states, whether of the body or of the soul, are not alterations.

For some are excellences and others are defects, and neither excellence nor defect is an
alteration: excellence is a perfection (for when anything acquires its proper excellence
we call it perfect, since it is then if ever that we have a thing in its natural state: e.g. we
have a perfect circle when we have one as good as possible), while defect is a perishing
of or departure from this condition. So as when speaking of a house we do not call its
arrival at perfection an alteration (for it would be absurd to suppose that the coping or
the tiling is an alteration or that in receiving its coping or its tiling a house is altered and
not perfected), the same also holds good in the case of excellences and defects and of the
persons or things that possess or acquire them: for excellences are perfections of a
thing’s nature and defects are departures from it: consequently they are not alterations.
Further, we say that all excellences depend upon particular relations. Thus bodily
excellences such as health and a good state of body we regard as consisting in a
blending of hot and cold elements within the body in due proportion, in relation either to
one another or to the surrounding atmosphere: and in like manner we regard beauty,
strength, and all the other bodily excellences and defects.

Each of them exists in virtue of a particular relation and puts that which possesses it in a
good or bad condition with regard to its proper affections, where by ‘proper’ affections I
mean those influences that from the natural constitution of a thing tend to promote or
destroy its existence. Since then, relatives are neither themselves alterations nor the
subjects of alteration or of becoming or in fact of any change whatever, it is evident that neither states nor the processes of losing and acquiring states are alterations, though it may be true that their becoming or perishing is necessarily, like the becoming or
perishing of a specific character or form, the result of the alteration of certain other
things, e.g. hot and cold or dry and wet elements or the elements, whatever they may be,
on which the states primarily depend. For each several bodily defect or excellence
involves a relation with those things from which the possessor of the defect or
excellence is naturally subject to alteration: thus excellence disposes its possessor to be
unaffected by these influences or to be affected by those of them that ought to be
admitted, while defect disposes its possessor to be affected by them or to be unaffected
by those of them that ought to be admitted.

And the case is similar in regard to the states of the soul, all of which (like those of
body) exist in virtue of particular relations, the excellences being perfections of nature
and the defects departures from it: moreover, excellence puts its possessor in good
condition, while defect puts its possessor in a bad condition, to meet his proper
affections. Consequently these cannot any more than the bodily states be alterations, nor
can the processes of losing and acquiring them be so, though their becoming is
necessarily the result of an alteration of the sensitive part of the soul, and this is altered
by sensible objects: for all moral excellence is concerned with bodily pleasures and
pains, which again depend either upon acting or upon remembering or upon
anticipating. Now those that depend upon action are determined by sense-perception,
i.e. they are stimulated by something sensible: and those that depend upon memory or
anticipation are likewise to be traced to sense-perception, for in these cases pleasure is
felt either in remembering what one has experienced or in anticipating what one is going
to experience.

Thus all pleasure of this kind must be produced by sensible things: and since the
presence in any one of moral defect or excellence involves the presence in him of
pleasure or pain (with which moral excellence and defect are always concerned), and
these pleasures and pains are alterations of the sensitive part, it is evident that the loss
and acquisition of these states no less than the loss and acquisition of the states of the
body must be the result of the alteration of something else. Consequently, though their
becoming is accompanied by an alteration, they are not themselves alterations.
Again, the states of the intellectual part of the soul are not alterations, nor is there any
becoming of them. In the first place it is much more true of the possession of knowledge
that it depends upon a particular relation.

There is no becoming of these states. 

For that which is potentially possessed of knowledge becomes actually possessed of it not by being set in motion at all itself but by reason of the presence of something else: i.e. it is when it meets with the particular
object that it knows in a manner the particular through its knowledge of the universal.
(Again, there is no becoming of the actual use and activity of these states, unless it is
thought that there is a becoming of vision and touching and that the activity in question
is similar to these.) And the original acquisition of knowledge is not a becoming or an
alteration: for the terms ‘knowing’ and ‘understanding’ imply that the intellect has
reached a state of rest and come to a standstill, and there is no becoming that leads to a
state of rest, since, as we have said above, change at all can have a becoming.
Moreover, just as to say, when any one has passed from a state of intoxication or sleep
or disease to the contrary state, that he has become possessed of knowledge again is
incorrect in spite of the fact that he was previously incapable of using his knowledge,
so, too, when any one originally acquires the state, it is incorrect to say that he becomes
possessed of knowledge: for the possession of understanding and knowledge is
produced by the soul’s settling down out of the restlessness natural to it.

Hence, too, in learning and in forming judgements on matters relating to their senseperceptions children are inferior to adults owing to the great amount of restlessness and
motion in their souls. Nature itself causes the soul to settle down and come to a state of
rest for the performance of some of its functions, while for the performance of others
other things do so: but in either case the result is brought about through the alteration of
something in the body, as we see in the case of the use and activity of the intellect
arising from a man’s becoming sober or being awakened. It is evident, then, from the
preceding argument that alteration and being altered occur in sensible things and in the
sensitive part of the soul, and, except accidentally, in nothing else.
