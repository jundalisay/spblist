EVERYTHING that is in motion must be moved by something.

For if it has not the source of its motion in itself it is evident that it is moved by something other than itself, for there must be something else that moves it. 

If on the other hand it has the source of its motion in itself, let AB be taken to represent that which is in motion essentially of itself and not in virtue of the fact that something belonging to it is in motion. Now in the first place to assume that AB, because it is in motion as a whole and is not moved by
anything external to itself, is therefore moved by itself-this is just as if, supposing that
KL is moving LM and is also itself in motion, we were to deny that KM is moved by
anything on the ground that it is not evident which is the part that is moving it and
which the part that is moved.

In the second place that which is in motion without being moved by anything does not necessarily cease from its motion because something else is at rest, but a thing must be moved by something if the fact of something else having ceased from its motion causes it to be at rest.

Thus, if this is accepted, everything that is in motion must be moved by something. For AB, which has been taken to represent that which is in motion, must be divisible since everything that is in motion is divisible. Let
it be divided, then, at G. Now if GB is not in motion, then AB will not be in motion: for
if it is, it is clear that AG would be in motion while BG is at rest, and thus AB cannot
be in motion essentially and primarily.

But ex hypothesi AB is in motion essentially and primarily. Therefore if GB is not in
motion AB will be at rest. But we have agreed that that which is at rest if something
else is not in motion must be moved by something. Consequently, everything that is in
motion must be moved by something: for that which is in motion will always be
divisible, and if a part of it is not in motion the whole must be at rest.

Since everything that is in motion must be moved by something, let us take the case in
which a thing is in locomotion and is moved by something that is itself in motion, and
that again is moved by something else that is in motion, and that by something else, and
so on continually: then the series cannot go on to infinity, but there must be some first
movent. For let us suppose that this is not so and take the series to be infinite. 

Let A then be moved by B, B by G, G by D, and so on, each member of the series being moved by that which comes next to it.

Then since ex hypothesi the movent while causing motion is also itself in motion, and
the motion of the moved and the motion of the movent must proceed simultaneously (for
the movent is causing motion and the moved is being moved simultaneously) it is
evident that the respective motions of A, B, G, and each of the other moved movents are
simultaneous. Let us take the motion of each separately and let E be the motion of A, Z
of B, and H and O respectively the motions of G and D: for though they are all moved
severally one by another, yet we may still take the motion of each as numerically one,
since every motion is from something to something and is not infinite in respect of its
extreme points. By a motion that is numerically one I mean a motion that proceeds from
something numerically one and the same to something numerically one and the same in
a period of time numerically one and the same: for a motion may be the same
generically, specifically, or numerically: it is generically the same if it belongs to the
same category, e.g. substance or quality: it is specifically the same if it proceeds from
something specifically the same to something specifically the same, e.g. from white to
black or from good to bad, which is not of a kind specifically distinct: it is numerically the same if it proceeds from something numerically one to something numerically one in the same period of time, e.g. from a particular white to a particular black, or from a particular place to a particular place, in a particular period of time: for if the period of
time were not one and the same, the motion would no longer be numerically one though
it would still be specifically one.

We have dealt with this question above. Now let us further take the time in which A has
completed its motion, and let it be represented by K. Then since the motion of A is finite
the time will also be finite. But since the movents and the things moved are infinite, the
motion EZHO, i.e. the motion that is composed of all the individual motions, must be
infinite. For the motions of A, B, and the others may be equal, or the motions of the
others may be greater: but assuming what is conceivable, we find that whether they are
equal or some are greater, in both cases the whole motion is infinite. And since the
motion of A and that of each of the others are simultaneous, the whole motion must
occupy the same time as the motion of A: but the time occupied by the motion of A is
finite: consequently the motion will be infinite in a finite time, which is impossible.
It might be thought that what we set out to prove has thus been shown, but our
argument so far does not prove it, because it does not yet prove that anything impossible
results from the contrary supposition: for in a finite time there may be an infinite
motion, though not of one thing, but of many: and in the case that we are considering
this is so: for each thing accomplishes its own motion, and there is no impossibility in
many things being in motion simultaneously. But if (as we see to be universally the
case) that which primarily is moved locally and corporeally must be either in contact
with or continuous with that which moves it, the things moved and the movents must be
continuous or in contact with one another, so that together they all form a single unity:
whether this unity is finite or infinite makes no difference to our present argument; for in
any case since the things in motion are infinite in number the whole motion will be
infinite, if, as is theoretically possible, each motion is either equal to or greater than that
which follows it in the series: for we shall take as actual that which is theoretically
possible.

If, then, A, B, G, D form an infinite magnitude that passes through the motion
EZHO in the finite time K, this involves the conclusion that an infinite motion is passed
through in a finite time: and whether the magnitude in question is finite or infinite this is
in either case impossible. Therefore the series must come to an end, and there must be a
first movent and a first moved: for the fact that this impossibility results only from the
assumption of a particular case is immaterial, since the case assumed is theoretically
possible, and the assumption of a theoretically possible case ought not to give rise to
any impossible result.
