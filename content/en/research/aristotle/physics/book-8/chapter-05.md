Movement may come about in either of two ways. 

Either the movement is not itself responsible for the motion, which is to be referred to something else which moves the movent, or the movent is itself responsible for the motion. 

Further, in the latter case, either the movent immediately precedes the last thing in the series, or there may be one or more intermediate links: e.g. the stick moves the stone and is moved by the hand,
which again is moved by the man: in the man, however, we have reached a movent that is not so in virtue of being moved by something else.


The thing is moved both by the last and by the first movent in the series, but more strictly by the
first, since the first movent moves the last, whereas the last does not move the first, and
the first will move the thing without the last, but the last will not move it without the
first: e.g. the stick will not move anything unless it is itself moved by the man. 

If then everything that is in motion must be moved by something, and the movent must either
itself be moved by something else or not, and in the former case there must be some first
movent that is not itself moved by anything else, while in the case of the immediate
movent being of this kind there is no need of an intermediate movent that is also moved
(for it is impossible that there should be an infinite series of movents, each of which is
itself moved by something else, since in an infinite series there is no first term)-if then
everything that is in motion is moved by something, and the first movent is moved but
not by anything else, it much be moved by itself.

This same argument may also be stated in another way as follows. 

Every movent moves something and moves it with something, either with itself or with something else: e.g. a
man moves a thing either himself or with a stick, and a thing is knocked down either by
the wind itself or by a stone propelled by the wind. But it is impossible for that with
which a thing is moved to move it without being moved by that which imparts motion
by its own agency: on the other hand, if a thing imparts motion by its own agency, it is
not necessary that there should be anything else with which it imparts motion, whereas
if there is a different thing with which it imparts motion, there must be something that
imparts motion not with something else but with itself, or else there will be an infinite
series. If, then, anything is a movent while being itself moved, the series must stop
somewhere and not be infinite. Thus, if the stick moves something in virtue of being
moved by the hand, the hand moves the stick: and if something else moves with the
hand, the hand also is moved by something different from itself. So when motion by
means of an instrument is at each stage caused by something different from the
instrument, this must always be preceded by something else which imparts motion with
itself. Therefore, if this last movent is in motion and there is nothing else that moves it,
it must move itself. So this reasoning also shows that when a thing is moved, if it is not
moved immediately by something that moves itself, the series brings us at some time or
other to a movent of this kind.

And if we consider the matter in yet a third wa Ly we shall get this same result as
follows. If everything that is in motion is moved by something that is in motion, ether
this being in motion is an accidental attribute of the movents in question, so that each of
them moves something while being itself in motion, but not always because it is itself in
motion, or it is not accidental but an essential attribute. Let us consider the former
alternative. If then it is an accidental attribute, it is not necessary that that is in motion
should be in motion: and if this is so it is clear that there may be a time when nothing
that exists is in motion, since the accidental is not necessary but contingent. Now if we
assume the existence of a possibility, any conclusion that we thereby reach will not be an impossibility though it may be contrary to fact. But the nonexistence of motion is an
impossibility: for we have shown above that there must always be motion.
Moreover, the conclusion to which we have been led is a reasonable one. For there must
be three things-the moved, the movent, and the instrument of motion.
Now the moved must be in motion, but it need not move anything else: the instrument of
motion must both move something else and be itself in motion (for it changes together
with the moved, with which it is in contact and continuous, as is clear in the case of
things that move other things locally, in which case the two things must up to a certain
point be in contact): and the movent-that is to say, that which causes motion in such a
manner that it is not merely the instrument of motion-must be unmoved. Now we have
visual experience of the last term in this series, namely that which has the capacity of
being in motion, but does not contain a motive principle, and also of that which is in
motion but is moved by itself and not by anything else: it is reasonable, therefore, not to
say necessary, to suppose the existence of the third term also, that which causes motion
but is itself unmoved. So, too, Anaxagoras is right when he says that Mind is impassive
and unmixed, since he makes it the principle of motion: for it could cause motion in this
sense only by being itself unmoved, and have supreme control only by being unmixed.
We will now take the second alternative. If the movement is not accidentally but
necessarily in motion-so that, if it were not in motion, it would not move anything-then
the movent, in so far as it is in motion, must be in motion in one of two ways: it is
moved either as that is which is moved with the same kind of motion, or with a different
kind-either that which is heating, I mean, is itself in process of becoming hot, that which
is making healthy in process of becoming healthy, and that which is causing locomotion
in process of locomotion, or else that which is making healthy is, let us say, in process
of locomotion, and that which is causing locomotion in process of, say, increase. But it
is evident that this is impossible. For if we adopt the first assumption we have to make
it apply within each of the very lowest species into which motion can be divided: e.g. we
must say that if some one is teaching some lesson in geometry, he is also in process of
being taught that same lesson in geometry, and that if he is throwing he is in process of
being thrown in just the same manner. Or if we reject this assumption we must say that
one kind of motion is derived from another; e.g. that that which is causing locomotion is
in process of increase, that which is causing this increase is in process of being altered
by something else, and that which is causing this alteration is in process of suffering
some different kind of motion. But the series must stop somewhere, since the kinds of
motion are limited; and if we say that the process is reversible, and that that which is
causing alteration is in process of locomotion, we do no more than if we had said at the
outset that that which is causing locomotion is in process of locomotion, and that one
who is teaching is in process of being taught: for it is clear that everything that is moved
is moved by the movent that is further back in the series as well as by that which
immediately moves it: in fact the earlier movent is that which more strictly moves it. But
this is of course impossible: for it involves the consequence that one who is teaching is
in process of learning what he is teaching, whereas teaching necessarily implies
possessing knowledge, and learning not possessing it.

Still more unreasonable is the consequence involved that, since everything that is moved
is moved by something that is itself moved by something else, everything that has a
capacity for causing motion has as such a corresponding capacity for being moved: i.e.
it will have a capacity for being moved in the sense in which one might say that everything that has a capacity for making healthy, and exercises that capacity, has as such a capacity for being made healthy, and that which has a capacity for building has as such a capacity for being built. It will have the capacity for being thus moved either immediately or through one or more links (as it will if, while everything that has a
capacity for causing motion has as such a capacity for being moved by something else,
the motion that it has the capacity for suffering is not that with which it affects what is
next to it, but a motion of a different kind; e.g. that which has a capacity for making
healthy might as such have a capacity for learn. the series, however, could be traced
back, as we said before, until at some time or other we arrived at the same kind of
motion). Now the first alternative is impossible, and the second is fantastic: it is absurd
that that which has a capacity for causing alteration should as such necessarily have a
capacity, let us say, for increase. It is not necessary, therefore, that that which is moved
should always be moved by something else that is itself moved by something else: so there will be an end to the series. 

Consequently the first thing that is in motion will  derive its motion either from something that is at rest or from itself. But if there were any need to consider which of the two, that which moves itself or that which is moved by something else, is the cause and principle of motion, every one would decide the former: for that which is itself independently a cause is always prior as a cause to that which is so only in virtue of being itself dependent upon something else that makes it so.

We must therefore make a fresh start and consider the question; if a thing moves itself,
in what sense and in what manner does it do so? Now everything that is in motion must
be infinitely divisible, for it has been shown already in our general course on Physics,
that everything that is essentially in motion is continuous. Now it is impossible that that
which moves itself should in its entirety move itself: for then, while being specifically
one and indivisible, it would as a Whole both undergo and cause the same locomotion
or alteration: thus it would at the same time be both teaching and being taught (the same
thing), or both restoring to and being restored to the same health. Moreover, we have
established the fact that it is the movable that is moved; and this is potentially, not
actually, in motion, but the potential is in process to actuality, and motion is an
incomplete actuality of the movable. 

The movent on the other hand is already in activity:
e.g. it is that which is hot that produces heat: in fact, that which produces the form is
always something that possesses it. Consequently (if a thing can move itself as a whole),
the same thing in respect of the same thing may be at the same time both hot and not
hot. So, too, in every other case where the movent must be described by the same name
in the same sense as the moved. 

Therefore when a thing moves itself it is one part of it
that is the movent and another part that is moved. But it is not self-moving in the sense
that each of the two parts is moved by the other part: the following considerations make
this evident. In the first place, if each of the two parts is to move the other, there will be
no first movent. 

If a thing is moved by a series of movents, that which is earlier in the
series is more the cause of its being moved than that which comes next, and will be
more truly the movent: for we found that there are two kinds of movent, that which is
itself moved by something else and that which derives its motion from itself: and that
which is further from the thing that is moved is nearer to the principle of motion than
that which is intermediate. In the second place, there is no necessity for the movent part
to be moved by anything but itself: so it can only be accidentally that the other part
moves it in return. 

I take then the possible case of its not moving it: then there will be a
part that is moved and a part that is an unmoved movent. In the third place, there is no
necessity for the movent to be moved in return: on the contrary the necessity that there
should always be motion makes it necessary that there should be some movent that is
either unmoved or moved by itself. In the fourth place we should then have a thing
undergoing the same motion that it is causingthat which is producing heat, therefore,
being heated. But as a matter of fact that which primarily moves itself cannot contain
either a single part that moves itself or a number of parts each of which moves itself.

For, if the whole is moved by itself, it must be moved either by some part of itself or as a whole by itself as a whole. If, then, it is moved in virtue of some part of it being
moved by that part itself, it is this part that will be the primary self-movent, since, if this
part is separated from the whole, the part will still move itself, but the whole will do so
no longer. If on the other hand the whole is moved by itself as a whole, it must be
accidentally that the parts move themselves: and therefore, their self-motion not being
necessary, we may take the case of their not being moved by themselves.

Therefore in the whole of the thing we may distinguish that which imparts motion
without itself being moved and that which is moved: for only in this way is it possible
for a thing to be self-moved. 

Further, if the whole moves itself we may distinguish in it
that which imparts the motion and that which is moved: so while we say that AB is
moved by itself, we may also say that it is moved by A. And since that which imparts
motion may be either a thing that is moved by something else or a thing that is
unmoved, and that which is moved may be either a thing that imparts motion to
something else or a thing that does not, that which moves itself must be composed of
something that is unmoved but imparts motion and also of something that is moved but
does not necessarily impart motion but may or may not do so. Thus let A be something
that imparts motion but is unmoved, B something that is moved by A and moves G, G
something that is moved by B but moves nothing (granted that we eventually arrive at G
we may take it that there is only one intermediate term, though there may be more). Then
the whole ABG moves itself. But if I take away G, AB will move itself, A imparting
motion and B being moved, whereas G will not move itself or in fact be moved at all.
Nor again will BG move itself apart from A: for B imparts motion only through being
moved by something else, not through being moved by any part of itself. So only AB
moves itself. 

That which moves itself, therefore, must comprise something that imparts
motion but is unmoved and something that is moved but does not necessarily move
anything else: and each of these two things, or at any rate one of them, must be in
contact with the other. If, then, that which imparts motion is a continuous substance-that
which is moved must of course be so-it is clear that it is not through some part of the
whole being of such a nature as to be capable of moving itself that the whole moves
itself: it moves itself as a whole, both being moved and imparting motion through
containing a part that imparts motion and a part that is moved. It does not impart
motion as a whole nor is it moved as a whole: it is A alone that imparts motion and B
alone that is moved.

It is not true, further, that G is moved by A, which is impossible.
Here a difficulty arises: if something is taken away from A (supposing that that which
imparts motion but is unmoved is a continuous substance), or from B the part that is
moved, will the remainder of A continue to impart motion or the remainder of B
continue to be moved? If so, it will not be AB primarily that is moved by itself, since,
when something is taken away from AB, the remainder of AB will still continue to move
itself. Perhaps we may state the case thus: there is nothing to prevent each of the two
parts, or at any rate one of them, that which is moved, being divisible though actually
undivided, so that if it is divided it will not continue in the possession of the same
capacity: and so there is nothing to prevent self-motion residing primarily in things that
are potentially divisible.

From what has been said, then, it is evident that that which primarily imparts motion is
unmoved: for, whether the series is closed at once by that which is in motion but moved
by something else deriving its motion directly from the first unmoved, or whether the
motion is derived from what is in motion but moves itself and stops its own motion, on
both suppositions we have the result that in all cases of things being in motion that
which primarily imparts motion is unmoved.
