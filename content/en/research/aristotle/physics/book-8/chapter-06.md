Since there must always be motion without intermission, there must necessarily be
something, one thing or it may be a plurality, that first imparts motion, and this first
movent must be unmoved.

Now the question whether each of the things that are
unmoved but impart motion is eternal is irrelevant to our present argument: 

But the following considerations will make it clear that there must necessarily be some such
thing, which, while it has the capacity of moving something else, is itself unmoved and
exempt from all change, which can affect it neither in an unqualified nor in an accidental
sense. 

Let us suppose, if any one likes, that in the case of certain things it is possible for them at different times to be and not to be, without any process of becoming and perishing (in fact it would seem to be necessary, if a thing that has not parts at one time is and at another time is not, that any such thing should without undergoing any process of change at one time be and at another time not be). 

Let us further suppose it
possible that some principles that are unmoved but capable of imparting motion at one
time are and at another time are not. Even so, this cannot be true of all such principles,
since there must clearly be something that causes things that move themselves at one
time to be and at another not to be. For, since nothing that has not parts can be in
motion, that which moves itself must as a whole have magnitude, though nothing that
we have said makes this necessarily true of every movent. So the fact that some things
become and others perish, and that this is so continuously, cannot be caused by any one
of those things that, though they are unmoved, do not always exist: nor again can it be
caused by any of those which move certain particular things, while others move other
things. The eternity and continuity of the process cannot be caused either by any one of
them singly or by the sum of them, because this causal relation must be eternal and
necessary, whereas the sum of these movents is infinite and they do not all exist
together. 


There may be countless instances of the perishing of some principles that are unmoved but impart motion, and though many things that move themselves perish and are succeeded by others that come into being, and though
one thing that is unmoved moves one thing while another moves another, nevertheless
there is something that comprehends them all, and that as something apart from each
one of them, and this it is that is the cause of the fact that some things are and others are
not and of the continuous process of change: and this causes the motion of the other
movents, while they are the causes of the motion of other things.

Motion then is eternal.

The first movent, if there is but one, will be eternal also: if there are more than
one, there will be a plurality of such eternal movents. We ought, however, to suppose
that there is one rather than many, and a finite rather than an infinite number. When the
consequences of either assumption are the same, we should always assume that things
are finite rather than infinite in number, since in things constituted by nature that which
is finite and that which is better ought, if possible, to be present rather than the reverse:
and here it is sufficient to assume only one movent, the first of unmoved things, which
being eternal will be the principle of motion to everything else.

The following argument also makes it evident that the first movent must be something
that is one and eternal. We have shown that there must always be motion. That being so,
motion must also be continuous, because what is always is continuous, whereas what is
merely in succession is not continuous. But further, if motion is continuous, it is one:
and it is one only if the movent and the moved that constitute it are each of them one,
since in the event of a thingâ€™s being moved now by one thing and now by another the
whole motion will not be continuous but successive.

Moreover a conviction that there is a first unmoved something may be reached not only
from the foregoing arguments, but also by considering again the principles operative in
movents. Now it is evident that among existing things there are some that are sometimes
in motion and sometimes at rest. This fact has served above to make it clear that it is not
true either that all things are in motion or that all things are at rest or that some things
are always at rest and the remainder always in motion: on this matter proof is supplied
by things that fluctuate between the two and have the capacity of being sometimes in
motion and sometimes at rest.

 The existence of things of this kind is clear to all: but we
wish to explain also the nature of each of the other two kinds and show that there are
some things that are always unmoved and some things that are always in motion.
In the course of our argument directed to this end we established the fact that everything
that is in motion is moved by something, and that the movent is either unmoved or in
motion, and that, if it is in motion, it is moved either by itself or by something else and
so on throughout the series: and so we proceeded to the position that the first principle
that directly causes things that are in motion to be moved is that which moves itself, and
the first principle of the whole series is the unmoved. Further it is evident from actual
observation that there are things that have the characteristic of moving themselves, e.g.
the animal kingdom and the whole class of living things. 

This being so, then, the view
was suggested that perhaps it may be possible for motion to come to be in a thing
without having been in existence at all before, because we see this actually occurring in
animals: they are unmoved at one time and then again they are in motion, as it seems.
We must grasp the fact, therefore, that animals move themselves only with one kind of
motion, and that this is not strictly originated by them. The cause of it is not derived
from the animal itself: it is connected with other natural motions in animals, which they
do not experience through their own instrumentality, e.g. increase, decrease, and
respiration: these are experienced by every animal while it is at rest and not in motion in
respect of the motion set up by its own agency: here the motion is caused by the
atmosphere and by many things that enter into the animal: thus in some cases the cause
is nourishment: when it is being digested animals sleep, and when it is being distributed
through the system they awake and move themselves, the first principle of this motion
being thus originally derived from outside. Therefore animals are not always in
continuous motion by their own agency: it is something else that moves them, itself
being in motion and changing as it comes into relation with each several thing that
moves itself. (Moreover in all these self-moving things the first movent and cause of
their self-motion is itself moved by itself, though in an accidental sense: that is to say,
the body changes its place, so that that which is in the body changes its place also and is
a self-movent through its exercise of leverage.) Hence we may confidently conclude that
if a thing belongs to the class of unmoved movents that are also themselves moved
accidentally, it is impossible that it should cause continuous motion. So the necessity
that there should be motion continuously requires that there should be a first movent
that is unmoved even accidentally, if, as we have said, there is to be in the world of
things an unceasing and undying motion, and the world is to remain permanently selfcontained and within the same limits: for if the first principle is permanent, the universe
must also be permanent, since it is continuous with the first principle.

 (We must
distinguish, however, between accidental motion of a thing by itself and such motion by
something else, the former being confined to perishable things, whereas the latter
belongs also to certain first principles of heavenly bodies, of all those, that is to say, that
experience more than one locomotion.) And further, if there is always something of this
nature, a movent that is itself unmoved and eternal, then that which is first moved by it
must be eternal. Indeed this is clear also from the consideration that there would
otherwise be no becoming and perishing and no change of any kind in other things,
which require something that is in motion to move them: for the motion imparted by the unmoved will always be imparted in the same way and be one and the same, since the
unmoved does not itself change in relation to that which is moved by it. But that which
is moved by something that, though it is in motion, is moved directly by the unmoved
stands in varying relations to the things that it moves, so that the motion that it causes
will not be always the same: by reason of the fact that it occupies contrary positions or
assumes contrary forms at different times it will produce contrary motions in each
several thing that it moves and will cause it to be at one time at rest and at another time
in motion.

The foregoing argument, then, has served to clear up the point about which we raised a
difficulty at the outset-why is it that instead of all things being either in motion or at
rest, or some things being always in motion and the remainder always at rest, there are
things that are sometimes in motion and sometimes not? The cause of this is now plain:
it is because, while some things are moved by an eternal unmoved movent and are
therefore always in motion, other things are moved by a movent that is in motion and
changing, so that they too must change.
But the unmoved movent, as has been said, since it remains permanently simple and
unvarying and in the same state, will cause motion that is one and simple.
