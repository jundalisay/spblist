<!-- This matter will be made clearer if we start afresh from another point. -->

Is it possible to have a continuous motion?

If there is, what is its primary motion?

If there must always be motion, and a particular motion is primary and continuous, then it is this motion that is imparted by the first movent, and so it is necessarily one and the same and continuous and primary.

There are 3 kinds of motion:

1. Motion in respect of magnitude
2. Motion in respect of affection
3. Motion in respect of place

The third is called locomotion. This is the primary.

It is impossible that there should be increase without the previous occurrence of alteration: for that which is increased, although in a sense it is increased by what is like itself, is in a sense increased by what is unlike itself: thus it is said that contrary is nourishment to contrary: but growth is effected only by things becoming like to like. 

There must be alteration, then, in that there is this change from contrary to contrary. But the fact that a thing is altered requires that there should be something that alters it, something e.g. that makes the potentially hot into the actually hot: so it is plain that the movent does not maintain a uniform relation to it but is at one time nearer to and at another farther from that which is altered: and we cannot have this without locomotion. 

If, therefore, there must always be motion, there must also always be locomotion as the primary motion, and, if there is a primary as distinguished from a secondary form of locomotion, it must be the primary form. Again, all affections have their origin in condensation and rarefaction: thus heavy and light, soft and hard, hot and cold, are considered to be forms of density and rarity. 

But condensation and rarefaction are nothing more than combination and separation, processes in accordance with which substances are said to become and perish: and in being combined and separated things must change in respect of place. And further, when a thing is increased or decreased its magnitude changes in respect of place.

Again, there is another point of view from which it will be clearly seen that locomotion is primary. As in the case of other things so too in the case of motion the word ‘primary’ may be used in several senses. A thing is said to be prior to other things when, if it does not exist, the others will not exist, whereas it can exist without the others: and there is also priority in time and priority in perfection of existence. Let us begin, then, with the first sense.

There must be motion continuously.

There may be continuously either:
- continuous motion or
  - This is in a higher degree than the latter
- successive motion

It is better that motion should be continuous rather than successive. 

We always assume the presence in nature of the better, if it be possible.

Locomotion must be primary because
- continuous motion is possible
<!--  (this will be proved later: for the present let
us take it for granted), and  -->
- no other motion can be continuous except locomotion,


This is because:

1. There is no necessity for the subject of locomotion to be the subject either of increase or of alteration, nor need it become or perish

On the other hand there cannot be any one of these processes without the existence of the continuous motion imparted by the first movent.

2. Locomotion is primary in time

This is the only motion possible for things. In the case of any individual thing that has a becoming, locomotion must be the last of its motions.

After its becoming it first experiences alteration and increase, and locomotion is a motion that belongs to such things only when they are perfected.

But there must previously be something else that is in process of locomotion to be the cause even of the becoming of things that become, without itself being in process of becoming, as e.g. the begotten is preceded by what begot it: otherwise becoming might be thought to be the primary motion on the ground that the
thing must first become.

But though this is so in the case of any individual thing that becomes, nevertheless before anything becomes, something else must be in motion, not itself becoming but being, and before this there must again be something else. 

Since becoming cannot be primary-for, if it were, everything that is in motion would be perishable-it is plain that no one of the motions next in order can be prior to locomotion. 

By the motions next in order I mean increase and then alteration, decrease, and perishing. All these are posterior to becoming: consequently, if not even becoming is prior to locomotion, then no one of the other processes of change is so either.

3. That which is in process of becoming appears universally as something imperfect and proceeding to a first principle.

And so what is posterior in the order of becoming is prior in the order of nature. Now all things that go through the process of becoming acquire locomotion last.

This accounts for the fact that some living things, e.g. plants and many kinds of animals, owing to lack of the requisite organ, are entirely without motion, whereas others acquire it in the course of their being perfected.


Therefore, if the degree in which things possess locomotion corresponds to the degree in which they have realized their natural development, then this motion must be prior to all others in respect of perfection of existence: and not only for this reason but also because a thing that is in motion loses its essential character less in the process of locomotion than in any other kind of motion: it is the only motion that does not involve a change of being in the sense in which there is a change in quality when a thing is altered and a
change in quantity when a thing is increased or decreased.

Above all, motion in respect of place is what is in the strictest sense produced by that which moves itself; but it is the self-movent that we declare to be the first principle of things that are moved and impart motion and the primary source to which things that are in motion are to be referred.

<!-- It is clear, then, from the foregoing arguments that locomotion is the primary motion. -->


Which kind of locomotion is primary?

<!-- The same process of reasoning will also make clear at the same time the truth of the assumption we have
made both now and at a previous stage that it is possible that there should be a motion
that is continuous and eternal. 

Now it is clear from the following considerations that  -->

No other than locomotion can be continuous. Every other motion and change is from an opposite to an opposite: 

Thus for the processes of becoming and perishing the limits are the existent and the non-existent, for alteration the various pairs of contrary affections, and for increase and decrease either greatness and smallness or perfection and imperfection of magnitude: and changes to the respective contraries are contrary
changes. 

A thing that is undergoing any particular kind of motion, but though previously existent has not always undergone it, must previously have been at rest so far as that motion is concerned. It is clear, then, that for the changing thing the contraries will be states of rest. And we have a similar result in the case of changes that are not motions: for becoming and perishing, whether regarded simply as such without
qualification or as affecting something in particular, are opposites: therefore provided it
is impossible for a thing to undergo opposite changes at the same time, the change will
not be continuous, but a period of time will intervene between the opposite processes.

The question whether these contradictory changes are contraries or not makes no difference, provided only it is impossible for them both to be present to the same thing at the same time: the point is of no importance to the argument. 

Nor does it matter if the thing need not rest in the contradictory state, or if there is no state of rest as a contrary to the process of change: it may be true that the non-existent is not at rest, and that perishing is a process to the non-existent.

All that matters is the intervention of a time: it is this that prevents the change from being continuous: so, too, in our previous instances the important thing was not the relation of contrariety but the impossibility of the 2 processes being present to a thing at the same time. 

There is no need to be disturbed by the fact that on this showing there may be more than one contrary to the same thing, that a particular motion will be contrary both to rest and to motion in the contrary direction. 

We have only to grasp the fact that a particular motion is in a sense the opposite both of a state of rest and of the contrary motion, in the same way as that which is of equal or standard measure is the opposite both of that which surpasses it and of that which it surpasses, and that it is impossible for the opposite motions or changes to be present to a thing at the same time.

Furthermore, in the case of becoming and perishing it would seem to be an utterly absurd thing if as soon as anything has become it must necessarily perish and cannot continue to exist for any time: and, if this is true of becoming and perishing, we have fair grounds for inferring the same to be true of the other kinds of change, since it would be in the natural order of things that they should be uniform in this respect.
