Let us suppose a time `ABG` and a thing `D`.

`D` is white in the time `A` and not-white in the time `B`.

Then `D` is white and not-white at the moment `G`.

For if we were right in saying that it is white during the whole time A, it is true to call it white at any moment of A, and not-white in B, and G is in both A and B.

We must not allow that it is white in the whole of A. But must say that it is so in all of it except the last moment G. 

`G` belongs already to the later period. If in the whole of A, not-white was in process of becoming and white of perishing, at G the process is complete.

And so `G` is the first moment at which it is true to call the thing white or not white respectively. 

Otherwise a thing may be non-existent at the moment when it has become and existent at the moment when it has perished: or else it must be possible for a thing at the same time to be white and not white and in fact to be existent and non-existent.

If anything that exists after having been previously nonexistent must become existent and does not exist when it is becoming, time cannot be divisible into time-atoms.

For suppose that D was becoming white in the time A and that at another time B, a timeatom consecutive with the last atom of A, D has already become white and so is white at that moment: then, inasmuch as in the time A it was becoming white and so was not white and at the moment B it is white, there must have been a becoming between A and B and therefore also a time in which the becoming took place.

I am not affected by this argument because I deny atoms of time. 

I say `D` has become and so is white at the last point of the actual time when it was becoming white.

This point has no other point consecutive with or in succession to it, whereas time-atoms are conceived as successive. 

If `D` were becoming white in the whole time A, the time occupied by it in having become white in addition to having been in process of becoming white is no more than all that it occupied in the mere process of becoming white. 

These and such-like, then, are the arguments for our conclusion that derive cogency from the fact that they have a special bearing on the point at issue. 

If we look at the question from the point of view of general theory, the same result would also appear to be indicated by the following arguments. 

Everything whose motion is continuous must, on arriving at any point in the course of its locomotion, have been previously also in process of locomotion to that point, if it is not forced out of its path by anything: e.g. on arriving at B a thing must also have been in process of locomotion to B, and that not merely when it was near to B, but from the moment of its starting on its course, since there can be, no reason for its being so at any particular stage rather than at an earlier one. 

So, too, in the case of the other kinds of motion. Now we are to suppose that a thing proceeds in locomotion from A to G and that at the moment of its arrival at G the continuity of its motion is unbroken and will remain so until it has arrived back at A. 

Then when it is undergoing locomotion from A to G it is at the same time undergoing also its locomotion to A from G: consequently it is simultaneously undergoing two contrary motions, since the two motions that follow the same straight line are contrary to each other. With this consequence there also follows another: we have a thing that is in process of change from a position in which it has not yet been: so, inasmuch as this is
impossible, the thing must come to a stand at G. Therefore the motion is not a single
motion, since motion that is interrupted by stationariness is not single.

Further, the following argument will serve better to make this point clear universally in respect of every kind of motion. 

If the motion undergone by that which is in motion is always one of those already enumerated, and the state of rest that it undergoes is one of those that are the opposites of the motions (for we found that there could be no other besides these), and moreover that which is undergoing but does not always undergo a
particular motion (by this I mean one of the various specifically distinct motions, not
some particular part of the whole motion) must have been previously undergoing the
state of rest that is the opposite of the motion, the state of rest being privation of
motion; then, inasmuch as the two motions that follow the same straight line are
contrary motions, and it is impossible for a thing to undergo simultaneously two
contrary motions, that which is undergoing locomotion from A to G cannot also
simultaneously be undergoing locomotion from G to A: and since the latter locomotion
is not simultaneous with the former but is still to be undergone, before it is undergone
there must occur a state of rest at G: for this, as we found, is the state of rest that is the
opposite of the motion from G. The foregoing argument, then, makes it plain that the
motion in question is not continuous.

<!-- Our next argument has a more special bearing than the foregoing on the point at issue. -->

Suppose that there has occurred in something simultaneously a perishing of notwhite and a becoming of white. Then if the alteration to white and from white is a
continuous process and the white does not remain any time, there must have occurred
simultaneously a perishing of not-white, a becoming of white, and a becoming of notwhite: for the time of the three will be the same.

Again, from the continuity of the time in which the motion takes place we cannot infer
continuity in the motion, but only successiveness: in fact, how could contraries, e.g. whiteness and blackness, meet in the same extreme point? On the other hand, in motion
on a circular line we shall find singleness and continuity: for here we are met by no
impossible consequence: that which is in motion from A will in virtue of the same
direction of energy be simultaneously in motion to A (since it is in motion to the point at
which it will finally arrive), and yet will not be undergoing two contrary or opposite
motions: for a motion to a point and a motion from that point are not always contraries
or opposites: they are contraries only if they are on the same straight line (for then they
are contrary to one another in respect of place, as e.g. the two motions along the
diameter of the circle, since the ends of this are at the greatest possible distance from
one another), and they are opposites only if they are along the same line. Therefore in
the case we are now considering there is nothing to prevent the motion being continuous
and free from all intermission: for rotatory motion is motion of a thing from its place to
its place, whereas rectilinear motion is motion from its place to another place.
Moreover the progress of rotatory motion is never localized within certain fixed limits,
whereas that of rectilinear motion repeatedly is so. Now a motion that is always shifting
its ground from moment to moment can be continuous: but a motion that is repeatedly
localized within certain fixed limits cannot be so, since then the same thing would have
to undergo simultaneously two opposite motions.

 So, too, there cannot be continuous
motion in a semicircle or in any other arc of a circle, since here also the same ground
must be traversed repeatedly and two contrary processes of change must occur. The
reason is that in these motions the starting-point and the termination do not coincide,
whereas in motion over a circle they do coincide, and so this is the only perfect motion.
This differentiation also provides another means of showing that the other kinds of
motion cannot be continuous either: for in all of them we find that there is the same
ground to be traversed repeatedly; thus in alteration there are the intermediate stages of
the process, and in quantitative change there are the intervening degrees of magnitude:
and in becoming and perishing the same thing is true.

It makes no difference whether we take the intermediate stages of the process to be few
or many, or whether we add or subtract one: for in either case we find that there is still
the same ground to be traversed repeatedly. Moreover it is plain from what has been
said that those physicists who assert that all sensible things are always in motion are
wrong: for their motion must be one or other of the motions just mentioned: in fact they
mostly conceive it as alteration (things are always in flux and decay, they say), and they
go so far as to speak even of becoming and perishing as a process of alteration. On the
other hand, our argument has enabled us to assert the fact, applying universally to all
motions, that no motion admits of continuity except rotatory motion: consequently
neither alteration nor increase admits of continuity. We need now say no more in
support of the position that there is no process of change that admits of infinity or
continuity except rotatory locomotion.
