What motions are contrary to each other?

How it is with rest?

Are contrary motions motions respectively from and to the same thing?

e.g. a motion from health and a motion to health (where the opposition, it would seem, is of the same kind as that between coming to be and ceasing to be); or motions respectively from contraries, e.g. a motion
from health and a motion from disease; or motions respectively to contraries, e.g. a
motion to health and a motion to disease; or motions respectively from a contrary and to
the opposite contrary, e.g. a motion from health and a motion to disease; or motions
respectively from a contrary to the opposite contrary and from the latter to the former,
e.g. a motion from health to disease and a motion from disease to health: for motions
must be contrary to one another in one or more of these ways, as there is no other way in
which they can be opposed.

Motions respectively from a contrary and to the opposite contrary, e.g. a motion
from health and a motion to disease, are not contrary motions: for they are one and the
same. (Yet their essence is not the same, just as changing from health is different from
changing to disease.) Nor are motion respectively from a contrary and from the opposite
contrary contrary motions, for a motion from a contrary is at the same time a motion to a
contrary or to an intermediate (of this, however, we shall speak later), but changing to a
contrary rather than changing from a contrary would seem to be the cause of the
contrariety of motions, the latter being the loss, the former the gain, of contrariness.
Moreover, each several motion takes its name rather from the goal than from the
starting-point of change, e.g. motion to health we call convalescence, motion to disease
sickening. Thus we are left with motions respectively to contraries, and motions
respectively to contraries from the opposite contraries. Now it would seem that motions
to contraries are at the same time motions from contraries (though their essence may not
be the same; ‘to health’ is distinct, I mean, from ‘from disease’, and ‘from health’ from
‘to disease’).

Since then change differs from motion (motion being change from a particular subject to
a particular subject), it follows that contrary motions are motions respectively from a
contrary to the opposite contrary and from the latter to the former, e.g. a motion from
health to disease and a motion from disease to health.

Moreover, the consideration of particular examples will also show what kinds of
processes are generally recognized as contrary: thus falling ill is regarded as contrary to
recovering one’s health, these processes having contrary goals, and being taught as
contrary to being led into error by another, it being possible to acquire error, like
knowledge, either by one’s own agency or by that of another. Similarly we have upward
locomotion and downward locomotion, which are contrary lengthwise, locomotion to the
right and locomotion to the left, which are contrary breadthwise, and forward
locomotion and backward locomotion, which too are contraries. On the other hand, a
process simply to a contrary, e.g. that denoted by the expression ‘becoming white’,
where no starting-point is specified, is a change but not a motion. 

In all cases of a thing that has no contrary we have as contraries change from and change to the same thing. Thus coming to be is contrary to ceasing to be, and losing to gaining. But these are changes and not motions.

And wherever a pair of contraries admit of an intermediate, motions to that intermediate
must be held to be in a sense motions to one or other of the contraries: for the intermediate serves as a contrary for the purposes of the motion, in whichever direction the change may be, e.g. grey in a motion from grey to white takes the place of black as
starting-point, in a motion from white to grey it takes the place of black as goal, and in a
motion from black to grey it takes the place of white as goal: for the middle is opposed
in a sense to either of the extremes, as has been said above. Thus we see that two
motions are contrary to each other only when one is a motion from a contrary to the
opposite contrary and the other is a motion from the latter to the former.95
