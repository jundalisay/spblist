EVERYTHING changes in 3 senses:

1. Accidentally

When we say that something musical walks, that which walks is something in which aptitude for music is an accident.


2. Without qualification to change

This is because something belonging to it changes, i.e. in statements which refer to part of the thing in question: thus the body is restored to health because the eye or the chest, that is to say a part of the whole body, is restored to health. 


3. Above all, through direct motion

<!--  the case of a thing which is in motion neither accidentally nor
in respect of something else belonging to it, but in virtue of being itself  -->

The thing is essentially movable.

Such a thing is a different thing according to the particular variety of motion.

For instance, it may be a thing capable of alteration. 

Within the sphere of alteration, it is again a different thing according as it is capable of being restored to health or capable of being heated.

There are the same distinctions in the case of the mover:

1. One thing causes motion accidentally
2. Another partially (because something belonging to it causes motion)
3. Another of itself directly, as, for instance, the physician heals, the hand strikes.

We have, then, the following factors:

1. That which directly causes motion
2. That which is in motion
3. The time where the motion takes place
4. The time that is distinct from those three
5. That to which it proceeds

Every motion proceeds from something and to something, that which is directly in motion being distinct from that to which it is in motion and that from which it is in motion: 

For instance, we may take the three things ‘wood’, ‘hot’, and ‘cold’, of which the first is that which is in motion, the second is that
to which the motion proceeds, and the third is that from which it proceeds. This being
so, it is clear that the motion is in the wood, not in its form: for the motion is neither
caused nor experienced by the form or the place or the quantity. So we are left with a
mover, a moved, and a goal of motion. I do not include the starting-point of motion: for
it is the goal rather than the starting-point of motion that gives its name to a particular
process of change. Thus ‘perishing’ is change to not-being, though it is also true that
that which perishes changes from being: and ‘becoming’ is change to being, though it is
also change from not-being.

Now a definition of motion has been given above, from which it will be seen that

Every goal of motion is immovable whether it be a form, an affection, or a place.

For instance, knowledge and heat. 

Here, however, a difficulty may be raised. 

Affections are motions. Whiteness is an affection.

Thus there may be change to a motion.

To this we may reply that it is not whiteness but whitening that is a motion.

This also has the same distinctions.

A goal of motion may be so:
- accidentally, or
- partially and with reference to something other than itself, or
- directly and with no reference to anything else.

For instance, a thing which is becoming white changes accidentally to an object of thought.
- The colour is only accidentally the object of thought.

The object of thought changes to colour because white is a part of colour.
- It can change to Europe, because Athens is a part of Europe [and the thing is in Athens].

But it changes essentially to white colour. 

So a thing is in motion essentially, accidentally, or in respect of something other than itself.*

{{< n n="This is metaphysical motion. It implies that accidents have some metaphysical cause" >}}


in what sense the phrase ‘itself directly’ is used in the case both of the mover and of the moved.

The motion is not in the form, but in the actual thing which is in motion, that is to say ‘the movable in activity’.

Accidental change we may leave out of account.

This is because it is found in everything, at any time, and in any respect.

Change which is not accidental on the other hand is not to be found in everything, but only in contraries, in things intermediate contraries, and in contradictories, as may be proved by induction.

An intermediate may be a starting-point of change, since for the purposes of the change it serves as contrary to either of 2 contraries: for the intermediate is in a sense the extremes.

Hence we speak of the
intermediate as in a sense a contrary relatively to the extremes and of either extreme as a
contrary relatively to the intermediate: for instance, the central note is low relatively-to
the highest and high relatively to the lowest, and grey is light relatively to black and
dark relatively to white.

And since every change is from something to something-as the word itself (metabole)
indicates, implying something ‘after’ (meta) something else, that is to say something
earlier and something later-that which changes must change in one of four ways: from
subject to subject, from subject to nonsubject, from non-subject to subject, or from nonsubject to non-subject, where by ‘subject’ I mean what is affirmatively expressed. So it
follows necessarily from what has been said above that there are only three kinds of
change, that from subject to subject, that from subject to non-subject, and that from nonsubject to subject: for the fourth conceivable kind, that from non-subject to nonsubject,
is not change, as in that case there is no opposition either of contraries or of
contradictories.

Now change from non-subject to subject, the relation being that of contradiction, is
‘coming to be’-’unqualified coming to be’ when the change takes place in an
unqualified way, ‘particular coming to be’ when the change is change in a particular
character: for instance, a change from not-white to white is a coming to be of the
particular thing, white, while change from unqualified not-being to being is coming to
be in an unqualified way, in respect of which we say that a thing ‘comes to be’ without
qualification, not that it ‘comes to be’ some particular thing. Change from subject to
non-subject is ‘perishing’-’unqualified perishing’ when the change is from being to notbeing, ‘particular perishing’ when the change is to the opposite negation, the distinction
being the same as that made in the case of coming to be.
Now the expression ‘not-being’ is used in several senses: and there can be motion
neither of that which ‘is not’ in respect of the affirmation or negation of a predicate, nor
of that which ‘is not’ in the sense that it only potentially ‘is’, that is to say the opposite
of that which actually ‘is’ in an unqualified sense: for although that which is ‘not-white’
or ‘not-good’ may nevertheless he in motion accidentally (for example that which is ‘not-white’ might be a man), yet that which is without qualification ‘not-so-and-so’ cannot in any sense be in motion: therefore it is impossible for that which is not to be in motion. This being so, it follows that ‘becoming’ cannot be a motion: for it is that which ‘is not’ that ‘becomes’. For however true it may be that it accidentally ‘becomes’, it is nevertheless correct to say that it is that which ‘is not’ that in an unqualified sense ‘becomes’. And similarly it is impossible for that which ‘is not’ to be at rest.

There are these difficulties, then, in the way of the assumption that that which ‘is not’ can be in motion: and it may be further objected that, whereas everything which is in motion is in space, that which ‘is not’ is not in space: for then it would be somewhere.

So, too, ‘perishing’ is not a motion: for a motion has for its contrary either another motion or rest, whereas ‘perishing’ is the contrary of ‘becoming’.

Since, then, every motion is a kind of change, and there are only the three kinds of
change mentioned above, and since of these three those which take the form of ‘becoming’ and ‘perishing’, that is to say those which imply a relation of contradiction,
are not motions: it necessarily follows that only change from subject to subject is
motion. And every such subject is either a contrary or an intermediate (for a privation
may be allowed to rank as a contrary) and can be affirmatively expressed, as naked, toothless, or black. If, then, the categories are severally distinguished as Being, Quality,
Place, Time, Relation, Quantity, and Activity or Passivity, it necessarily follows that
there are three kinds of motionqualitative, quantitative, and local.
