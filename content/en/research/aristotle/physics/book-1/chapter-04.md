The physicists on the other hand have 2 modes of explanation.

1. One makes the underlying body one either one of the three or something else
which is denser than fire and rarer than air.

Then it generates everything else from this, and obtain multiplicity by condensation and rarefaction. 

These are contraries, which may be generalized into ‘excess and defect’. (Compare Plato’s ‘Great and Small’-except that he make these his matter, the one his form, while the others treat the one which
underlies as matter and the contraries as differentiae, i.e. forms).

2. The other asserts that the contrarieties are contained in the one and emerge from it
by segregation, for example Anaximander and also all those who assert that ‘what is’ is
one and many, like Empedocles and Anaxagoras.

They too produce other things from their mixture by segregation. These differ, however, from each other in that the former imagines a cycle of such changes, the latter a single series. Anaxagoras again made both his ‘homceomerous’ substances and his contraries infinite in multitude, whereas
Empedocles posits only the socalled elements.

The theory of Anaxagoras that the principles are infinite in multitude was probably due to his acceptance of the common opinion of the physicists that nothing comes into being from not-being. 

For this is the reason why they use the phrase ‘all things were together’ and the coming into being of such and such a kind of thing is reduced to change of quality, while some spoke of combination and separation.

Moreover, the fact that the contraries proceed from each other led them to the conclusion. The one, they reasoned, must have already existed in the other; for since everything that comes into being must
arise either from what is or from what is not, and it is impossible for it to arise from
what is not (on this point all the physicists agree), they thought that the truth of the
alternative necessarily followed, namely that things come into being out of existent
things, i.e. out of things already present, but imperceptible to our senses because of the
smallness of their bulk. So they assert that everything has been mixed in every. thing,
because they saw everything arising out of everything. But things, as they say, appear
different from one another and receive different names according to the nature of the
particles which are numerically predominant among the innumerable constituents of the
mixture. For nothing, they say, is purely and entirely white or black or sweet, bone or
flesh, but the nature of a thing is held to be that of which it contains the most.
Now (1) the infinite qua infinite is unknowable, so that what is infinite in multitude or
size is unknowable in quantity, and what is infinite in variety of kind is unknowable in
quality. But the principles in question are infinite both in multitude and in kind.
Therefore it is impossible to know things which are composed of them; for it is when we
know the nature and quantity of its components that we suppose we know a complex.
Further (2) if the parts of a whole may be of any size in the direction either of greatness
or of smallness (by ‘parts’ I mean components into which a whole can be divided and
which are actually present in it), it is necessary that the whole thing itself may be of any
size. Clearly, therefore, since it is impossible for an animal or plant to be indefinitely
big or small, neither can its parts be such, or the whole will be the same. But flesh,
bone, and the like are the parts of animals, and the fruits are the parts of plants. Hence it
is obvious that neither flesh, bone, nor any such thing can be of indefinite size in the
direction either of the greater or of the less.

Again (3) according to the theory all such things are already present in one another and
do not come into being but are constituents which are separated out, and a thing receives
its designation from its chief constituent. Further, anything may come out of anythingwater by segregation from flesh and flesh from water.

Hence, since every finite body is exhausted by the repeated abstraction of a finite body,
it seems obviously to follow that everything cannot subsist in everything else. For let
flesh be extracted from water and again more flesh be produced from the remainder by
repeating the process of separation: then, even though the quantity separated out will
continually decrease, still it will not fall below a certain magnitude. If, therefore, the
process comes to an end, everything will not be in everything else (for there will be no
flesh in the remaining water); if on the other hand it does not, and further extraction is
always possible, there will be an infinite multitude of finite equal particles in a finite
quantity-which is impossible.

Another proof may be added: Since every body must diminish in size when something is
taken from it, and flesh is quantitatively definite in respect both of greatness and
smallness, it is clear that from the minimum quantity of flesh no body can be separated
out; for the flesh left would be less than the minimum of flesh.

Lastly (4) in each of his infinite bodies there would be already present infinite flesh and
blood and brain- having a distinct existence, however, from one another, and no less real
than the infinite bodies, and each infinite: which is contrary to reason.

The statement that complete separation never will take place is correct enough, though
Anaxagoras is not fully aware of what it means. For affections are indeed inseparable. If
then colours and states had entered into the mixture, and if separation took place, there
would be a ‘white’ or a ‘healthy’ which was nothing but white or healthy, i.e. was not
the predicate of a subject. So his ‘Mind’ is an absurd person aiming at the impossible, if
he is supposed to wish to separate them, and it is impossible to do so, both in respect of
quantity and of quality- of quantity, because there is no minimum magnitude, and of
quality, because affections are inseparable.

Nor is Anaxagoras right about the coming to be of homogeneous bodies. It is true there
is a sense in which clay is divided into pieces of clay, but there is another in which it is
not. Water and air are, and are generated ‘from’ each other, but not in the way in which
bricks come ‘from’ a house and again a house ‘from’ bricks; and it is better to assume a smaller and finite number of principles, as
Empedocles does.
