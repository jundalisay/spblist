The present is also necessarily indivisible.

The present, that is, not in the sense in which the word is applied to one thing in virtue of another, but in its proper and primary sense; in which sense it is inherent in all time. For the present is something that is an extremity of the past (no part of the future being on this side of it) and also of the future (no part
of the past being on the other side of it): it is, as we have said, a limit of both. And if it
is once shown that it is essentially of this character and one and the same, it will at once
be evident also that it is indivisible.

Now the present that is the extremity of both times must be one and the same: for if each
extremity were different, the one could not be in succession to the other, because nothing
continuous can be composed of things having no parts: and if the one is apart from the
other, there will be time intermediate between them, because everything continuous is
such that there is something intermediate between its limits and described by the same
name as itself. But if the intermediate thing is time, it will be divisible: for all time has
been shown to be divisible.

Thus on this assumption the present is divisible. But if the present is divisible, there
will be part of the past in the future and part of the future in the past: for past time will
be marked off from future time at the actual point of division. Also the present will be a
present not in the proper sense but in virtue of something else: for the division which
yields it will not be a division proper. Furthermore, there will be a part of the present
that is past and a part that is future, and it will not always be the same part that is past
or future: in fact one and the same present will not be simultaneous: for the time may be
divided at many points. If, therefore, the present cannot possibly have these characteristics, it follows that it must be the same present that belongs to each of the two times. But if this is so it is evident that the present is also indivisible: for if it is divisible it will be involved in the same implications as before. It is clear, then, from what has been said that time contains something indivisible, and this is what we call a
present.

We will now show that nothing can be in motion in a present. For if this is possible,
there can be both quicker and slower motion in the present. Suppose then that in the
present N the quicker has traversed the distance AB. That being so, the slower will in
the same present traverse a distance less than AB, say AG.

But since the slower will have occupied the whole present in traversing AG, the quicker
will occupy less than this in traversing it. Thus we shall have a division of the present,
whereas we found it to be indivisible. It is impossible, therefore, for anything to be in
motion in a present.

Nor can anything be at rest in a present: for, as we were saying, only can be at rest which is naturally designed to be in motion but is not in motion when, where, or as it would naturally be so: since, therefore, nothing is naturally designed to be in motion in a present, it is clear that nothing can be at rest in a present either.

Moreover, inasmuch as it is the same present that belongs to both the times, and it is possible for a thing to be in motion throughout one time and to be at rest throughout the other, and that which is in motion or at rest for the whole of a time will be in motion or at rest as the case may be in any part of it in which it is naturally designed to be in motion or at rest: this being so, the assumption that there can be motion or rest in a present will carry with it the implication that the same thing can at the same time be at
rest and in motion: for both the times have the same extremity, viz. the present.


Again, when we say that a thing is at rest, we imply that its condition in whole and in
part is at the time of speaking uniform with what it was previously: but the present
contains no ‘previously’: consequently, there can be no rest in it.
It follows then that the motion of that which is in motion and the rest of that which is at
rest must occupy time.
