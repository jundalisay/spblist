Our next point is that that which is without parts cannot be in motion except accidentally: i.e. it can be in motion only in so far as the body or the magnitude is in motion and the partless is in motion by inclusion therein, just as that which is in a boat may be in motion in consequence of the locomotion of the boat, or a part may be in motion in virtue of the motion of the whole.

It must be remembered, however, that by ‘that which is without parts’ I mean that which is quantitatively indivisible (and that the case of the motion of a part is not exactly parallel.

For parts have motions belonging essentially and severally to themselves distinct from the motion of the whole. 

The distinction may be seen most clearly in the case of a revolving sphere, in which the velocities of the parts near the centre and of those on the surface are different from one another and from that of the whole; this implies that there is not one motion but many).

That which is without parts can be in motion in the sense in which a man sitting in a boat is in motion when the boat is travelling, but it cannot be in motion of itself. For suppose that it is changing from AB to BG-either from one magnitude to another, or from one form to another, or from some state to its contradictory-and let D be the primary time in which it undergoes the change. 

Then in the time in which it is changing it must be either in AB or in BG or partly in one and partly in the other: for this, as we saw, is true of everything that is changing. Now it cannot be partly in each of the two: for then it would be divisible into parts. 

Nor again can it be in BG: for then it will have completed the change, whereas the assumption is that the change is in process.

It remains, then, that in the time in which it is changing, it is in AB. That being so, it will be at rest: for, as we saw, to be in the same condition for a period of time is to be at rest. So it is not possible for that which has no parts to be in motion or to change in any way: for only one condition could have made it possible for it to have motion, viz. that time should be composed of moments, in which case at any moment it would have completed a motion or a change, so that it would never be in motion, but would always have been in motion. But this we have already shown above to be impossible: time is not composed of moments, just as a line is not composed of points, and motion is not composed of starts: for this theory simply makes motion consist of indivisibles in exactly the same way as time is made to consist of moments or a length of points.

Again, it may be shown in the following way that there can be no motion of a point or of any other indivisible. That which is in motion can never traverse a space greater than itself without first traversing a space equal to or less than itself. That being so, it is evident that the point also must first traverse a space equal to or less than itself. 

But since it is indivisible, there can be no space less than itself for it to traverse first: so it will have to traverse a distance equal to itself. Thus the line will be composed of points, for the point, as it continually traverses a distance equal to itself, will be a measure of the whole line. But since this is impossible, it is likewise impossible for the indivisible to be in motion.

Again, since motion is always in a period of time and never in a moment, and all time is divisible, for everything that is in motion there must be a time less than that in which it traverses a distance as great as itself. For that in which it is in motion will be a time, because all motion is in a period of time; and all time has been shown above to be divisible.

Therefore, if a point is in motion, there must be a time less than that in which it has itself traversed any distance. But this is impossible, for in less time it must traverse less distance, and thus the indivisible will be divisible into something less than itself, just as the time is so divisible: the fact being that the only condition under which that which is without parts and indivisible could be in motion would have been the possibility of the infinitely small being in motion in a moment: for in the two questionsthat of motion in a moment and that of motion of something indivisible-the same
principle is involved.


No process of change is infinite: for every change, whether
between contradictories or between contraries, is a change from something to
something. Thus in contradictory changes the positive or the negative, as the case may
be, is the limit, e.g. being is the limit of coming to be and not-being is the limit of
ceasing to be: and in contrary changes the particular contraries are the limits, since these
are the extreme points of any such process of change, and consequently of every process
of alteration: for alteration is always dependent upon some contraries. 

Similarly contraries are the extreme points of processes of increase and decrease: the limit of
increase is to be found in the complete magnitude proper to the peculiar nature of the
thing that is increasing, while the limit of decrease is the complete loss of such
magnitude. 

Locomotion, it is true, we cannot show to be finite in this way, since it is not
always between contraries. But since that which cannot be cut (in the sense that it is
inconceivable that it should be cut, the term ‘cannot’ being used in several senses)-since
it is inconceivable that that which in this sense cannot be cut should be in process of
being cut, and generally that that which cannot come to be should be in process of
coming to be, it follows that it is inconceivable that that which cannot complete a
change should be in process of changing to that to which it cannot complete a change.

If, then, it is to be assumed that that which is in locomotion is in process of changing, it
must be capable of completing the change. Consequently its motion is not infinite, and it
will not be in locomotion over an infinite distance, for it cannot traverse such a distance.

It is evident, then, that a process of change cannot be infinite in the sense that it is not
defined by limits. But it remains to be considered whether it is possible in the sense that
one and the same process of change may be infinite in respect of the time which it
occupies. 

If it is not one process, it would seem that there is nothing to prevent its being
infinite in this sense; e.g. if a process of locomotion be succeeded by a process of
alteration and that by a process of increase and that again by a process of coming to be:
in this way there may be motion for ever so far as the time is concerned, but it will not
be one motion, because all these motions do not compose one. If it is to be one process,
no motion can be infinite in respect of the time that it occupies, with the single
exception of rotatory locomotion.
