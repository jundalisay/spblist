## The First Visible Fruit of the Contemplative Life

So, lord, I ask the Buddha as well: What is the Visible Fruit of the Contemplative Life?

<!-- There are these common craftsmen: elephant-trainers, horse-trainers, charioteers, archers, standard bearers, camp marshals, supply corps officers, high royal officers, commandos, military heroes, armor-clad warriors, leather-clad warriors, domestic slaves, confectioners, barbers, bath attendants, cooks, garland-makers, laundrymen, weavers, basket-makers, potters, calculators, accountants, and any other common craftsmen of a similar sort. They live off the fruits of their crafts, visible in the here and now. They give pleasure and refreshment to themselves, to their parents, wives, and children, to their friends and colleagues. They put in place an excellent presentation of offerings to brahmans and contemplatives, leading to heaven, resulting in happiness, conducive to a heavenly rebirth. Is it possible, lord, to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?" -->

First, I will ask you a counter-question.

Suppose there were a man of yours: your slave, your workman, rising in the morning before you, going to bed in the evening only after you, doing whatever you order, always acting to please you, speaking politely to you, always watching for the look on your face. 


The thought would occur to him: 'Isn't it amazing? Isn't it astounding? — the destination, the results, of meritorious deeds. 

For this King Ajatasattu is a human being, and I, too, am a human being.

Yet King Ajatasattu enjoys himself supplied and replete with the 5 strings of sensuality — like a deva, as it were — while I am his slave, his worker  always watching for the look on his face. I, too, should do meritorious deeds.

What if I were to shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?'

So after some time he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. 

Having thus gone forth he lives restrained in body, speech, and mind, content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude. 

Then suppose one of your men were to inform you: 

'You should know, your majesty, that that man of yours — your slave, your workman... always watching for the look on your face... has gone forth from the household life into homelessness... content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude.' 

Would you, thus informed, say, 'Bring that man back to me. Make him again be my slave, my workman... always watching for the look on my face!'?"



Not at all, lord. Rather, I would bow down to him, rise up out of respect for him, invite him to a seat, invite him to accept gifts of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites for the sick.

I would provide him with righteous safety, defense, and protection."


In that case, do you think there is a visible fruit of the contemplative life, or none?"

"Yes, lord. There certainly is a visible fruit of the contemplative life."

"This, great king, is the first fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now, that I point out to you."

## The Second Visible Fruit of the Contemplative Life

But what is another fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?"

"Yes, but I will ask you a counter-question. 

Suppose there were a man of yours: a farmer, a householder, a taxpayer swelling the royal treasury. 

The thought would occur to him: 'Isn't it amazing? 

Isn't it astounding? — the destination, the results, of meritorious deeds! 

For this King Ajatasattu is a human being, and I, too, am a human being, yet King Ajatasattu enjoys himself supplied and replete with the five strings of sensuality — like a deva, as it were — while I am a farmer, a householder, a taxpayer swelling the royal treasury. I, too, should do meritorious deeds. What if I were to shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?'

"So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth, large or small; leaves his circle of relatives, large or small; shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. 

Having thus gone forth he lives restrained in body, speech, and mind, content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude. 

Then suppose one of your men were to inform you: 'You should know, your majesty, that that man of yours — the farmer, the householder, the taxpayer swelling the royal treasury... has gone forth from the household life into homelessness... content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude.' 

Would you, thus informed, say, 'Bring that man back to me. Make him again be a farmer, a householder, a taxpayer swelling the royal treasury!'?"

"Not at all, lord. Rather, I am the one who should bow down to him, rise up out of respect for him, invite him to a seat, invite him to accept gifts of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites for the sick. 

I would provide him with righteous safety, defense, and protection."

"So in that case, is there a visible fruit of the contemplative life, or none?"

"Yes, lord. There certainly is a visible fruit of the contemplative life."

"This, great king, is the second fruit of the contemplative life.
