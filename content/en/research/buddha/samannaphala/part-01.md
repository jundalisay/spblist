I have heard that on one occasion the Buddha was staying at Rajagaha, in Jivaka Komarabhacca's mango grove, with a large community of monks — 1,250 monks in all. 

It was the observance day, the full-moon night of the water-lily season, the fourth month of the rains.

King Ajatasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Videha, was sitting on the roof terrace of his palace surrounded by his ministers. 

Then he felt inspired to exclaim: "How wonderful is this moonlit night! How beautiful... How lovely... How inspiring... How auspicious is this moonlit night! What brahman or contemplative should we visit tonight who might enlighten and bring peace to our mind?"

One of the ministers replied: 

"Your majesty, there is the famous Purana Kassapa, the leader and teacher of a group, esteemed as holy by the mass of people. 

He is aged, long gone forth, advanced in years, in the last phase of life. You should visit him to enlighten and bring peace to your mind."

When this was said, the king remained silent.

Then another minister said to the king: 

"Your majesty, there is:
- Makkhali Gosala
- Ajita Kesakambalin
- Pakudha Kaccayana
- Sañjaya Belatthaputta
- Nigantha Nataputta, the leader of a community, esteemed as holy by the people

<!-- , the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, honored and famous, .  -->
He is aged, in the last phase of life. Your majesty should visit him. Perhaps, if you visited him, he would enlighten and bring peace to your mind."


When this was said, the king remained silent.

All this time Jivaka Komarabhacca was sitting silently not far from the king. So the king said to him, 

"Friend Jivaka, why are you silent?"

"Your majesty, there is the Buddha, worthy and rightly self-awakened, staying in my mango grove with a large community of monks — 1,250 monks in all. Concerning this Buddha, this admirable report has been spread: 'Surely, the Buddha is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear knowing and conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of tamable people, teacher of beings human and divine, awakened, blessed.' Your majesty should visit him. Perhaps, if you visited him, he would enlighten and bring peace to your mind."

"Then in that case, friend Jivaka, have the riding elephants prepared."

Having replied, "As you say, your majesty," having had 500 female elephants prepared as well as the king's personal tusker, Jivaka announced to the king: 

"Your majesty, your riding elephants are prepared. Do what you think it is now time to do."

Then the king had 500 of his women mounted on the 500 female elephants — one on each — and having mounted his own personal tusker, set out from the capital in full royal state, with attendants carrying torches, headed for Jivaka Komarabhacca's mango grove. 

But when the king was not far from the mango grove, he was gripped with fear, his hair standing on end.

Fearful, agitated, his hair standing on end, he said to Jivaka Komarabhacca: 

"Friend Jivaka, you aren't deceiving or betraying me, are you? You aren't turning me over to my enemies, are you? How can there be such a large community of monks — 1,250 in all — with no sound of sneezing, no sound of coughing, no voices at all?"

"Don't be afraid, great king.. I'm not deceiving you or betraying you or turning you over to your enemies. Go forward, great king, go forward! Those are lamps burning in the pavilion hall."

Then the king, going as far on his tusker as the ground would permit, dismounted and approached the door of the pavilion on foot. 

On arrival, he asked Jivaka: "Where, friend Jivaka, is the Buddha?"

"That is the Buddha, great king, sitting against the middle pillar, facing east, surrounded by the community of monks."

Then the king approached the Buddha and, on reaching him, stood to one side. 

As he was standing there — surveying the community of monks sitting in absolute silence, as calm as a lake — he felt inspired to exclaim: 

"May my son, Prince Udayibhadda, enjoy the same peace that this community of monks now enjoys!"

[The Buddha said:] "Have you come, great king, together with your affections?"

"Lord, my son, Prince Udayibhadda, is very dear to me. May he enjoy the same peace that this community of monks now enjoys!"


Then, bowing down to the Buddha, and saluting the community of monks with his hands palm-to-palm over his heart, he sat to one side. 

As he was sitting there, he said to the Buddha: 

"I would like to ask the Buddha about a certain issue, if he would give me the opportunity to explain my question."

"Ask, great king, whatever you like."

## The King's Question

Lord, there are these common craftsmen: 
- elephant-trainers
- horse-trainers
- charioteers
- archers
- standard bearers
- camp marshals
- supply corps officers
- high royal officers
- commandos
- military heroes
- armor-clad warriors
- leather-clad warriors
- domestic slaves
- confectioners
- barbers
- bath attendants
- cooks
- garland-makers
- laundrymen
- weavers
- basket-makers
- potters
- calculators
- accountants
- etc

They live off the fruits of their crafts, visible in the here and now. 

They give pleasure and refreshment to themselves, to their parents, wives, and children, to their friends and colleagues. 

They put in place an excellent presentation of offerings to brahmans and contemplatives, leading to heaven, resulting in happiness, conducive to a heavenly rebirth. 

Can you point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?"


"Have you asked this question to other brahmans and contemplatives?"

"Yes."

"How did they answer?"
