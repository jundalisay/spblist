## Higher Fruits of the Contemplative Life

"But is there yet another fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?"

"Yes, there is the case, great king, where a Tathagata appears in the world, worthy and rightly self-awakened. 

He teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning, admirable in its middle, admirable in its end. He proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure.

A householder or householder's son, hearing the Dhamma, gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects: 'Household life is confining, a dusty path. 

The life gone forth is like the open air. It is not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect, totally pure, like a polished shell. 

What if I were to shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?'

"So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth, large or small; leaves his circle of relatives, large or small; shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness.

When he has thus gone forth, he lives restrained by the rules of the monastic code, seeing danger in the slightest faults. 

Consummate in his virtue, he guards the doors of his senses, is possessed of mindfulness and alertness, and is content.

## The Lesser Section on Virtue

How is a monk consummate in virtue? Abandoning the taking of life, he abstains from the taking of life. 

He dwells with his rod laid down, his knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings. This is part of his virtue.

Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given. He takes only what is given, accepts only what is given, lives not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pure. This, too, is part of his virtue.

Abandoning uncelibacy, he lives a celibate life, aloof, refraining from the sexual act that is the villager's way. This, too, is part of his virtue.

"Abandoning false speech, he abstains from false speech. He speaks the truth, holds to the truth, is firm, reliable, no deceiver of the world. This, too, is part of his virtue.

"Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech. What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here.

What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people there. Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united, he loves concord, delights in concord, enjoys concord, speaks things that create concord. This, too, is part of his virtue.

Abandoning abusive speech, he abstains from abusive speech. He speaks words that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate, that go to the heart, that are polite, appealing and pleasing to people at large. This, too, is part of his virtue.

Abandoning idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter. 

He speaks in season, speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with the goal, the Dhamma, and the Vinaya.

He speaks words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed, connected with the goal. This, too, is part of his virtue.

"He eats only once a day, refraining from the evening meal and from food at the wrong time of day.

"He abstains from:
- damaging seed and plant life.
- dancing, singing, instrumental music, and from watching shows.
- wearing garlands and from beautifying himself with scents and cosmetics.
- high and luxurious beds and seats.
- accepting gold and money.
