[ I ]

I have heard that the Buddha was traveling on the highway between Rājagaha & Nālanda with approximately 500 monks.

Suppiya the wanderer was traveling on the highway between Rājagaha & Nālanda with his apprentice, Brahmadatta the young brahman.

Along the way, Suppiya the wanderer spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha,the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. 

But Suppiya’s apprentice, Brahmadatta the young brahman, spoke in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and of the Saṅgha. 

Thus both of these, mentor & apprentice, speaking in direct contradiction to each other, followed right behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of monks.

Then the Buddha with the monks entered the royal resthouse at Mango Stone to spend the night.
- Suppiya and Brahmadatta too entered the royal resthouse at Mango Stone to spend the night. 

<!-- There, too, Suppiya the wanderer spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, in dispraise of the Dhamma, in dispraise of the Saṅgha. 

But Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in praise of the Buddha, in praise of the Dhamma, in praise of the Saṅgha. Thus both of these, mentor & apprentice, speaking in direct contradiction to each other, followed right behind the Blessed One and the Saṅgha of monks. -->

Then, among a large number of monks who had arisen in the last watch of the night and were sitting gathered together in a pavilion, this discussion arose: 

{{< r a="Monks" >}}
Isn’t it amazing how the Buddha has truly experienced the differing convictions of beings. Suppiya speaks in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. But Brahmadatta speaks in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. Thus mentor & apprentice, speaking in direct contradiction to each other, follow right behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of monks.
{{< /r >}}

Then the Buddha, knowing this discussion of the monks, went to the pavilion. On arrival, sat down on a seat laid out. 

Seated, he addressed the monks:

{{< l a="Buddha" >}}
For what topic of conversation are you sitting gathered together here? What is the topic of your conversation that has been interrupted midway?”
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Monks" >}}
Just now, lord, this discussion arose: ‘Isn’t it amazing! This Suppiya speaks in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, in dispraise of the Dhamma, in dispraise of the Saṅgha. But Brahmadatta speaks in many ways in praise of the Buddha, in praise of the Dhamma, in praise of the Saṅgha.’”
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Buddha" >}}
Monks, if others were to speak in dispraise of me, the Dhamma, or the Saṅgha, neither hatred nor antagonism nor displeasure of mind would be proper. If you would be upset and angered, that would be an obstruction for you yourselves. In such a case, would you know what of those others was well-said or poorly said?”
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Monks" >}}
“No, lord.”
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Buddha" >}}
“If others were to speak in dispraise of me, the Dhamma, or the Saṅgha, you should unravel and explicate what is unfactual as unfactual: ‘This is unfactual, this is inaccurate, there is nothing of that in us, and that is not to be found in us.’
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Buddha" >}}
“If others were to speak in praise of me, the Dhamma, or the Saṅgha, neither joy nor gladness nor exhilaration of mind would be proper. If you would be joyful, glad, & exhilarated, that would be an obstruction for you yourselves. In such a case, would you know what of those others was well-said or poorly said?”
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Monks" >}}
“No, lord.”
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Buddha" >}}
“If others were to speak in praise of me, the Dhamma, or the Saṅgha, you should unravel and explicate what is factual as factual: ‘This is factual, this is accurate, there is that in us, and that is to be found in us.’

{{< l a="Buddha" >}}
A run-of-the-mill person would praise the Tathāgata speaking of minor matters, lower matters, matters of virtue.

<!-- And which are the minor matters, lower matters, matters of virtue, of which a run-of-the-mill person, when praising the Tathāgata, would speak? -->
