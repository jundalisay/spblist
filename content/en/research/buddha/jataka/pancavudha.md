<!-- "When no Attachment."--This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about a Brother who had given up all earnest effort.

Said the Master to him, "Is the report true, Brother, that you are a backslider?"

"Yes, Blessed One."

"In bygone days, Brother," said the Master, "the wise and good won a throne by their dauntless perseverance in the hour of need."

And so saying, he told this story of the past. -->


Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, it was as his queen's child that the Bodhisatva came to life once more. 

On the day when he was to be named, the parents enquired as to their child's destiny from 800 brahmins, to whom they gave their hearts' desire in all pleasures of sense. 

Marking the promise which he shewed of a glorious destiny, these clever soothsaying brahmins foretold that, coming to the throne at the king's death, the child should be a mighty king endowed with every virtue; famed and renowned for his exploits with 5 weapons, he should stand peerless in all Jambudīpa 1. [273] 

And because of this prophecy of the brahmins, the parents named their son Prince Pancavudha (Five-Weapons).

When the prince was 16 years old, the king bade him go away and study.

{{< l a="Bodhisatva" >}}
With whom, sire, am I to study?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="King" >}}
With the world-famed teacher in the town of Takkasilā in the Gandhāra country. Here is his fee
{{< /r >}}

The king handed to his son 1,000 pieces.

So the prince went to Takkasilā and was taught there. 

When he was leaving, Takkasilā gave him a set of 5 weapons, armed with which, after bidding adieu to his old master, the prince set out from Takkasilā for Benares.

On his way he came to a forest haunted by a yaksa named Silesaloma (Hairy-grip). 

At the entrance to the forest, men who met him tried to stop him, saying: 

{{< r a="Man" >}}
Young brahmin, do not go through that forest; it is the haunt of the yaksa Silesaloma. He kills every one he meets.
{{< /r >}}


But, bold as a lion, the self-reliant Bodhisatva pressed on, till in the heart of the forest he came on the yaksa. 

The monster made himself appear in stature as tall as a palm-tree, with a head as big as an arbour and huge eyes like bowls, with 2 tusks like turnips and the beak of a hawk.

His belly was blotched with purple. The palms of his hands and the soles of his feet were blue-black!

{{< n n="We represent Silesaloma with Paul Samuelson who ensnares humans with Neoclassical Economics which devours humans whole and turns them into lifeless machines, slaves to money" >}}


{{< r a="Silesaloma" >}}
Halt! you are my prey
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Bodhisatva" >}}
Yaksa, I knew what I was doing when entering this forest. You will be ill-advised to come near me. For with a poisoned arrow I will slay you where you stand.
{{< /r >}}


With this defiance, he fitted to his bow an arrow dipped in deadliest poison and shot it at the yaksa. 

But it only stuck on to the monster's shaggy coat. Then he shot another and another, till 50 were spent, all of which merely stuck on to the yaksa's shaggy coat. 

Hereon the yaksa, shaking the arrows off so that they fell at his feet, came at the Bodhisatva who  drew his sword and struck at the yaksa.

But, like the arrows, his sword, which was 33 inches long, merely stuck fast in the shaggy hair.

Next the Bodhisatva hurled his spear, and that stuck fast also. 

Seeing this, he smote the yaksa with his club. 

But, like his other weapons, that too stuck fast. 

The Bodhisatva shouted:

{{< l a="Bodhisatva" >}}
Yaksa, you never heard yet of me, Prince Pancavudha. **When I ventured into this forest, I put my trust not in my bow and other weapons, but in myself!** Now will I strike you a blow which shall crush you into dust.
{{< /l >}}


So saying, the Bodhisatva smote the yaksa with his right hand. But the hand stuck fast on the hair. Then, in turn, with his left hand and with his right and left feet, he struck at the monster, but hand and feet alike clave to the hide. 

Again shouting:

{{< l a="Bodhisatva" >}}
I will crush you into dust!
{{< /l >}}

He butted the yaksa with his head, and that too stuck fast.

<!-- fivefold wise -->

Yet even when thus caught and snared in, the Bodhisatva, as he hung on the yaksa, was still fearless, still undaunted.

The monster thought to himself

{{< r a="Silesaloma" >}}
This is a very lion among men, a hero without a peer, and no mere man. Though he is caught in the clutches of an yaksa like me, yet he exhibits no tremor. 

Since I first started slaying travellers on this road, never have I seen a man to equal him. How come he is not frightened?" 
{{< /r >}}


Not daring to devour the Bodhisatva offhand, he said:

{{< r a="Silesaloma" >}}
How is it, young brahmin, that you have no fear of death?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Bodhisatva" >}}
Why should I? Each life must surely have its destined death. Moreover, within my body is a sword of adamant, which you will never digest, if you eat me. 

It will chop your inwards into mincemeat, and my death will involve yours too. Therefore it is that I have no fear.
{{< /l >}}


(By this, it is said, the Bodhisatva meant the Sword of Knowledge, which was within him.)


Hereon, the yaksa fell a-thinking. 

{{< r a="Silesaloma" >}}
This young brahmin is speaking the truth. Not a morsel so big as a pea could I digest of such a hero. I will let him go.
{{< /r >}}


In fear of his life, he let the Bodhisatva go free, saying, 


{{< r a="Silesaloma" >}}
Young brahmin, you are a lion among men. I will not eat you. Go forth from my hand, even as the moon from the jaws of Rāhu, and return to gladden the hearts of your kinsfolk, your friends, and your country.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Bodhisatva" >}}
I will go. As for you, it was your sins in bygone days that caused you to be reborn a ravening, murderous, flesh-eating yaksa. If you continue in sin in this existence, you will go on from darkness to darkness. 

But, having seen me, you will be unable to sin any more. Know that to destroy life is to ensure re-birth either in hell or as a brute or as a ghost or among the fallen spirits. Or, if the re-birth be into the world of men, then such sin cuts short the days of a man's life.
{{< /l >}}


In this and other ways, the Bodhisatva sheaved the evil consequences of the 5 bad courses, and the blessing that comes of the 5 good courses.

 <!-- and so wrought in divers ways -->

By his teaching on the yaksa's fears, he converted the monster, imbuing him with **self-denial** and establishing him in the Five Commandments.*

{{< n n="Here, the prince converted the Negative Force into the Positive by putting himself in the shoes of the Yaksa" >}}

Then he made the yaksa the fairy of that forest, with a right to **levy dues**,* and charging him to remain steadfast. The Bodhisatva went his way, making known the change in the yaksa's mood as he left the forest. 

{{< n n="Here, the materialism softens from a venture capitalist hungry for 100x returns to a mere set fee for consultation service" >}}

In the end he came, armed with the five weapons, to the city of Benares, and presented himself before his parents. 

In later days, when king, he was a righteous ruler. After a life spent in charity and other good works he passed away to fare thereafter according to his deserts.

_____________________________

This lesson ended, the Master, as Buddha, recited this stanza:

{{< q >}}
When no attachment* hampers heart or mind,
When righteousness is practised peace to win,
He who so walks, shall gain the victory
and utterly destroy all the Fetters  2.
{{< /q >}}


{{< n n="*The most common attachment is to material objects" >}}


When he had thus led his teaching up to Arahatship as its crowning point, the Master went on to preach the Four Truths, at the close whereof that Brother won Arahatship. 

Also, the Master showed the connexion, and identified the Birth by saying, 

"Aṅgulimāla was the yaksa of those days, and I myself Prince Pancavudha."
