The experimental results in the study of the statics of a simple fluid are complex. 
- But mixtures are more complex.


Mixed fluids are composed of many invariable particles.

In this particularly simple case M. Van der Waals has established a characteristic equation of the mixtures which is founded on mechanical considerations. 

Various verifications of this formula have been effected, and it has, in particular, been the object of very important remarks by M. Daniel Berthelot.

Thermodynamics seems powerless to determine this equation. It does not trouble itself about the nature of the bodies obedient to its laws.

But, on the other hand, it intervenes to determine the properties of coexisting phases.

If we examine the conditions of equilibrium of a mixture which is not subjected to external forces, it will be demonstrated that the distribution must come back to a juxtaposition of homogeneous phases; in a given volume, matter ought so to arrange itself that the total sum of free energy has a minimum value. 

Thus, in order to elucidate all questions relating to the number and qualities of the phases into which the substance divides itself, we are led to regard the geometrical surface which for a given temperature represents the free energy.

I am unable to enter here into the detail of the questions connected with the theories of Gibbs, which have been the object of numerous theoretical studies, and also of a series, ever more and more abundant, of experimental researches.

M. Duhem, in particular, has published, on the subject, memoirs of the highest importance, and a great number of experimenters, mostly scholars working in the physical laboratory of Leyden under the guidance of the Director, Mr Kamerlingh Onnes, have endeavoured to verify the anticipations of the theory.

We are a little less advanced as regards abnormal substances; that is to say, those composed of molecules, partly simple and partly complex, and either dissociated or associated. These cases must naturally be governed by very complex laws. Recent researches by MM. Van der Waals, Alexeif, Rothmund, Künen, Lehfeld, etc., throw, however, some light on the question.

The daily more numerous applications of the laws of corresponding states have rendered highly important the determination of the critical constants which permit these states to be defined. In the case of homogeneous bodies the critical elements have a simple, clear, and precise sense; the critical temperature is that of the single isothermal line which presents a point of inflexion at a horizontal tangent; the critical pressure and the critical volume are the two co-ordinates of this point of inflexion.

The three critical constants may be determined, as Mr S. Young and M. Amagat have shown, by a direct method based on the consideration of the saturated states. Results, perhaps more precise, may also be obtained if one keeps to two constants or even to a single one—temperature, for example—by employing various special methods. Many others, MM. Cailletet and Colardeau, M. Young, M.J. Chappuis, etc., have proceeded thus.

The case of mixtures is much more complicated. A binary mixture has a critical space instead of a critical point. This space is comprised between two extreme temperatures, the lower corresponding to what is called the folding point, the higher to that which we call the point of contact of the mixture. 

Between these two temperatures an isothermal compression yields a quantity of liquid which increases, then reaches a maximum, diminishes, and disappears. This is the phenomenon of retrograde condensation. We may say that the properties of the critical point of a homogeneous substance are, in a way, divided, when it is a question of a binary mixture, between the two points mentioned.

Calculation has enabled M. Van der Waals, by the application of his kinetic theories, and M. Duhem, by means of thermodynamics, to foresee most of the results which have since been verified by experiment. All these facts have been admirably set forth and systematically co-ordinated by M. Mathias, who, by his own researches, moreover, has made contributions of the highest value to the study of questions regarding the continuity of the liquid and gaseous states.

The further knowledge of critical elements has allowed the laws of corresponding states to be more closely examined in the case of homogeneous substances. It has shown that, as I have already said, bodies must be arranged in groups, and this fact clearly proves that the properties of a given fluid are not determined by its critical constants alone, and that it is necessary to add to them some other specific parameters; M. Mathias and M. D. Berthelot have indicated some which seem to play a considerable part.

It results also from this that the characteristic equation of a fluid cannot yet be considered perfectly known. Neither the equation of Van der Waals nor the more complicated formulas which have been proposed by various authors are in perfect conformity with reality. We may think that researches of this kind will only be successful if attention is concentrated, not only on the phenomena of compressibility and dilatation, but also on the calorimetric properties of bodies. Thermodynamics indeed establishes relations between those properties and other constants, but does not allow everything to be foreseen.

Several physicists have effected very interesting calorimetric measurements, either, like M. Perot, in order to verify Clapeyron's formula regarding the heat of vaporization, or to ascertain the values of specific heats and their variations when the temperature or the pressure happens to change. M. Mathias has even succeeded in completely determining the specific heats of liquefied gases and of their saturated vapours, as well as the heat of internal and external vaporization.
