{{< s v="1" >}} Let us seek the dignity of knowledge in the archetype or first platform, as the attributes and acts of God.

We call this wisdom or sapience instead of learning because all learning is knowledge acquired, yet all knowledge in God is original. 

<!-- , as far as they are revealed to man and may be observed with sobriety; wherein we may not seek it by the name of learning, for , and , and therefore we must look for it by another name, that of wisdom or , as the Scriptures call it. -->

{{< s v="2" >}} In creation, we see a double emanation of virtue from God:

1. One refers more properly to power

This subsists as matter

2. The other refers to wisdom

This disposes the beauty of the form.*

{{< n n="This is the same as Cartesian duality, which we call separation of the physical and metaphysical domains" >}}

Creation was made from the confused mass and matter of heaven and earth in a moment. The order and disposition of that chaos or mass was the work of 6 days.

This difference was between the works of power and the works of wisdom.

<!-- wherewith concurreth, that in the former it is not set down that God said,  -->

“Let there be heaven and earth” has a style of law, decree, or counsel.

 <!-- as it is set down of the works following; but actually, that  -->

God making heaven and earth has the style of a manufacture.

<!-- , and the other of a . -->

{{< s v="3" >}} Next to God in order are the spirits.

<!-- : we find, as far as credit is to be given to the celestial hierarchy of that supposed Dionysius, the senator of Athens,  -->

1. The first place is given to the angels of love called seraphim
2. The second is given to the angels of light called cherubim
3. The third are angels of power and ministry

The angels of knowledge and illumination are placed before the angels of office and domination.

<!-- , and so following places, to thrones, principalities, and the rest, which  -->

<sup>4</sup> After the spirits and intellectual forms come the sensible and material forms.

The first form created was light. This creates a relation* and correspondence between nature and corporal things to knowledge in spirits and incorporal things.

{{< n n="Cartesian Relationality and Poincare's Law Relativity are both exposed by the constant speed of light" >}}


<sup>5</sup> So in the distribution of days we see the day wherein God rested and contemplated His own works.

 <!-- was blessed above all the days wherein He did effect and accomplish them. -->


<sup>6</sup> After the creation was finished, man was placed in the garden to work as contemplation of his creation.

<!-- which work, so appointed to him, could be no other than work of ; that is, when  -->

The goal of work is for exercise and experiment, not for necessity.

Back then, creatures were obedient. 

<!-- there was  being then no reluctation of the creature, nor sweat of the brow,  -->

Man’s employment must have been a matter of delight in the experiment, and not matter of labour for the use.  

The tasks performed in Paradise were 2 summary parts of knowledge:

1. The view of creatures
2. The imposition of names

The knowledge which induced the fall was the moral knowledge of good and evil.

<!-- , it was, as was touched before, not the natural knowledge of creatures, but ;  -->

<!-- wherein the supposition was, that  -->

God’s commandments or prohibitions were not the originals of good and evil. Instead, good and evil had other beginnings.

Man aspired to know these, leading to the total defection from God and total dependence on himself.


<sup>7</sup> The fall of man led to 2 states:

1. The contemplative state
2. The active state

<!-- To pass on: in the first event or occurrence after the fall of man, we see (as the Scriptures have infinite mysteries, not violating at all the truth of this story or letter) an image of the two estates, , figured  -->

This was seen in Abel and Cain, and in the two most primitive trades of life:

- the shepherd
  - This is the contemplative life
   <!-- (who, by reason of his leisure, rest in a place, and lying in view of heaven, is a lively image of a ) -->
- the husbandman
   - God's favour went to the shepherd, not to the tiller of the ground.


<sup>8</sup> In the age after the flood, the first great judgment of God on the ambition of man was the confusion of tongues. This stopped the open trade and intercourse of learning and knowledge.

<!-- (8) So in the age before the flood, the holy records within those few memorials which are there entered and registered have vouchsafed to mention and honour the name of the inventors and authors of music and works in metal.   -->
