The continuity of line is of great significance. 

**Breaks** (see plate 28) in any line mean an obstruction. 
- They are sometimes overcome if they are healed by squares or supported by other strengthening influences. 

**Unevenness in the line** shows variability in that attribute. 

**Fine lines branching out from the main lines** and usually show a weakening of the main pathway, indicating distraction. 

**Splits** are such small branches. If a split is directed towards a different mount, it means that the subject is influenced by the attributes of that mount.

The branching line often strengthens its moment's diversion to main tendencies, telling the history of changes in interests: diversion to a serious change in the direction of one's life.

**Sister lines** are lines running independently but parallel to a main line add strength. 

But a sister line should not be confused with the island, which may run parallel to a main line for some distance but is attached to it at either end, thus forming a sort of enclosure.

An **island** very much weakens the main line at the point where it makes its appearance. 

Chained formations, dots, many crossed lines all react adversely on the primary line.

<!-- I shall discuss them in relation to the particular lines wherever they have special significance. -->

The best lines are clear, deep, without breaks or interfering markings of any kind. 

Very broad lines show more muscular strength than power. A deep, thin line holds up better under strain.


### Time And Age In The Hand: 7 Years Segments

Using the main lines of the hand as guidemarks, we can compute time and age on the hand.

Thus the approximate date associated with breaks, periods of restlessness and dissatisfaction, shifts in occupation, can all be calculated from the hand. 

The only date which does not show is the subject's age.

The approximate dates in the hand, divide the maximum length possible for the line of life, the headline, the heartline and the line of destiny each into periods of seven as shown in plate 29.

This is a very natural division since important physical changes in human beings are supposed to occur within cycles of **seven years**. 

Other markings on the hand can be related to this scheme by drawing radial lines from mount Venus through the seven divisions on the line of life and extending those imaginary radial lines to whatever event you wish to place in time. 

To estimate the probable length of life, add the number of periods in these four principal lines of the hand—the lines of head, heart, destiny and life—and divide your total by four.

Markings which are fixed in their place will have their own time scheme pertaining to them alone. 

For example, the marriage lines are figured within the confines of the space which they occupy, not in accordance with the plan of the whole hand, but this is explained in greater detail in my discussion of the marriage lines themselves.
