On the outer edge of the hand, extending into the palm under the little finger, there are often a number of horizontal lines. 

These are the lines of sex influence (see plate 27, number 6), or, as the older followers of palmistry termed them, the lines of marriage.

They do not show the number of times you have married or will marry. 

They show the number, depth and constancy of the sexual attractions which your personality complex makes possible for you.

Some of these relations may be realized, possibly in friendship with the opposite sex in which attraction plays a large part, possibly in marriage, whether actually legalized or not. 

A deeply felt and stable sexual relation will show on the hand regardless of the seal of civil and spiritual authority.

When the marriage lines are close to the line of heart (see the lowest of the 3 short lines in plate 52), they apply to youth.

In the middle of the space between the line of heart and the base of the finger of Mercury, marriage lines are placed at the ages of about 25-30. 

The closer to the finger of Mercury they appear (see the uppermost of the three short lines in plate 52), the greater the age to which they refer.

A marriage line which turns up toward the finger of Mercury (see plate 53) is usually found without companion lines and shows a person who is "not the marrying kind." 

A look at the line of heart will often disclose the reason--whether it be fickleness as indicated by a broad, chained line of heart or the bleak, self-centered disposition which goes with a thin, bare line of heart.

A fork at the end of the marriage line, especially one curving down hand (see plate 54), indicates the probability of separation or divorce, and a downward curve alone has the same significance.


The longer and clearer the line of sex influence, the more stable and deep will be the relationship. 

One of the strongest indications of a happy marriage is an influence line from the mount of Luna into the line of destiny, combined with a single, long and clearly marked line of marriage. 

A wealthy marriage is sometimes thought to be shown by a marriage line merging into the line of Apollo.

If the line of marriage is broken up or linked like a chain, the relationship will be very unhappy. The cause of such unhappiness -- physiological differences, diversity in interests or in temperament -- might be discovered by a comparison of the hands of two people contemplating a union.


## Lines Of Fertility

The small, vertical lines which stand up between the lines of marriage on the side of the hand (see plate 27, number 13) indicate fertility -- the number of children you can have, not at all necessarily the number you will have. 

Usually, they are much more clearly marked in the hands of women than of men. 
- Broad and deep lines indicate male children
- Narrow,  fine lines, indicate females. 

Very faint and uneven lines show delicacy in the offspring. Straight, deep, clear ones indicate strong and healthy children.

A very flat mount of Venus and a bracelet which rises from the wrist into the palm of the hand is usually considered a sign of sterility.
