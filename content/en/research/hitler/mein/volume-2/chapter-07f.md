On November 4, 1921, in the evening between 6-7pm I received the first news that the meeting would positively be broken up by our adversaries by sending to the meeting many workmen employed in certain 'Red' factories.

<!-- It was due to an unfortunate accident that we did not receive this news sooner.  -->

On that day we had given up our old business office in the Sternecker Gasse in Munich and moved into other quarters; or rather we had given up the old offices and our new quarters were not yet in functioning order. The telephone arrangements had been cut
off by the former tenants and had not yet been reinstalled. Hence it happened that
several attempts made that day to inform us by telephone of the break-up which had
been planned for the evening did not reach us.

Consequently our order troops were not present in strong force at that meeting. There was only one squad present, which did not consist of the usual one hundred men, but only of about 46. 

Our telephone connections were not yet sufficiently organized to be able to give the alarm in the course of an hour or so, so that a
sufficiently powerful number of order troops to deal with the situation could be called.
It must also be added that on several previous occasions we had been forewarned, but
nothing special happened. The old proverb, 'Revolutions which were announced have
scarcely ever come off', had hitherto been proved true in our regard.

Possibly for this reason also sufficiently strong precautions had not been taken on that day to cope with the brutal determination of our opponents to break up our meeting.

Finally, we did not believe that the Hofbräuhaus in Munich was suitable for the interruptive tactics of our adversaries. We had feared such a thing far more in the bigger halls, especially that of the Krone Circus. But on this point we learned a very
serviceable lesson that evening. Later, we studied this whole question according to a scientific system and arrived at results, both interesting and incredible, and which subsequently were an essential factor in the direction of our organization and in the
tactics of our Storm Troops.

When I arrived in the entrance halt of the Hofbräuhaus at 7.45 that evening I realizcd that there could be no doubt as to what the 'Reds' intended. The hall was filled, and for that reason the police had barred the entrances. Our adversaries, who had arrived very
early, were in the hall, and our followers were for the most part outside. 

The small bodyguard awaited me at the entrance. I had the doors leading to the principal hall
closed and then asked the bodyguard of forty-five or forty-six men to come forward. 


I made it clear to the boys that perhaps on that evening for the first time they would have to show their unbending and unbreakable loyalty to the movement and that not one of us should leave the hall unless carried out dead. I added that I would remain in the hall
and that I did not believe that one of them would abandon me, and that if I saw any one
of them act the coward I myself would personally tear off his armlet and his badge. 

I demanded of them that they should come forward if the slightest attempt to sabotage the meeting were made and that they must remember that the best defence is always attack.

I was greeted with a triple 'HEIL' which sounded more hoarse and violent than usual.

Then I advanced through the hall and could take in the situation with my own eyes.

Our opponents sat closely huddled together and tried to pierce me through with their looks. Innumerable faces glowing with hatred and rage were fixed on me, while others with sneering grimaces shouted at me together. Now they would 'Finish with us. We must look out for our entrails. Today they would smash in our faces once and for all.'

And there were other expressions of an equally elegant character. They knew that they were there in superior numbers and they acted accordingly. 

Yet we were able to open the meeting. I began to speak.

In the Hall of the Hofbräuhaus I stood always at the side, away from the entry and on top of a beer table. 

Therefore I was always right in the midst of the audience. Perhaps this circumstance was responsible for creating a certain feeling and a sense of agreement which I never found elsewhere.

Before me, and especially towards my left, there were only opponents, seated or standing. They were mostly robust youths and men from the Maffei Factory, from Kustermann's, and from the factories on the Isar, etc. Along the right-hand wall of the hall they were thickly massed quite close to my table. They now began to order litre mugs of beer, one after the other, and to throw the empty mugs under the table. 

In this way whole batteries were collected. I should have been surprised had this meeting ended peacefully. 

In spite of all the interruptions, I was able to speak for about an hour and a half and I felt as if I were master of the situation. Even the ringleaders of the disturbers appeared to be convinced of this; for they steadily became more uneasy, often left the hall, returned and spoke to their men in an obviously nervous way.

A small psychological error which I committed in replying to an interruption, and the
mistake of which I myself was conscious the moment the words had left my mouth,
gave the sign for the outbreak.

There were a few furious outbursts and all in a moment a man jumped on a seat and
shouted "Liberty". At that signal the champions of liberty began their work.
In a few moments the hall was filled with a yelling and shrieking mob. Numerous beermugs flew like howitzers above their heads. Amid this uproar one heard the crash of chair legs, the crashing of mugs, groans and yells and screams. 

It was a mad spectacle. I stood where I was and could observe my boys doing their duty, every one of them.

There I had the chance of seeing what a bourgeois meeting could be.

The dance had hardly begun when my Storm Troops, as they were called from that day onwards, launched their attack. Like wolves they threw themselves on the enemy again and again in parties of eight or ten and began steadily to thrash them out of the hall.

After five minutes I could see hardly one of them that was not streaming with blood.

Then I realized what kind of men many of them were, above all my brave Maurice Hess, who is my private secretary to-day, and many others who, even though seriously wounded, attacked again and again as long as they could stand on their feet. 

Twenty minutes long the pandemonium continued. Then the opponents, who had numbered seven or eight hundred, had been driven from the hall or hurled out headlong by my men, who had not numbered fifty. Only in the left corner a big crowd still stood out against our men and put up a bitter fight. Then two pistol shots rang out from the entrance to the hall in the direction of the platform and now a wild din of shooting broke out from all sides. One's heart almost rejoiced at this spectacle which recalled memories of the War.

At that moment it was not possible to identify the person who had fired the shots. But at any rate I could see that my boys renewed the attack with increased fury until finally the last disturbers were overcome and flung out of the hall. 

About 25 minutes had passed since it all began. The hall looked as if a bomb had exploded there. Many of my comrades had to be bandaged and others taken away.

But we remained masters of the situation. Hermann Essen, who was chairman of the  meeting, announced: "The meeting will continue. The speaker shall proceed." So I went on with my speech.

When we ourselves declared the meeting at an end an excited police officer rushed in,
waved his hands and declared: "The meeting is dissolved." 

Without wishing to do so I had to laugh at this example of the law's delay. It was the authentic constabulary officiosiousness. The smaller they are the greater they must always appear.

That evening we learned a real lesson. And our adversaries never forgot the lesson they had received.

Up to the autumn of 1923 the Münchener post did not again mention the clenched fists
of the Proletariat. 


### Notes

[Note 17. The Battle of Leipzig (1813), where the Germans inflicted an overwhelming
defeat on Napoleon, was the decisive event which put an end to the French occupation
of Germany.
[Note 18. The flag of the German Empire, founded in 1871, was Black-White-Red. This
was discarded in 1918 and Black-Red-Gold was chosen as the flag of the German
Republic founded at Weimar in 1919. The flag designed by Hitler--red with a white disc
in the centre, bearing the black swastika--is now the national flag.]
