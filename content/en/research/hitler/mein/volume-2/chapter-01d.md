The VÖLKISCH concept of the world recognizes that the primordial racial elements are of the greatest significance for mankind. 

It sees the State as a means to conserve the racial characteristics of mankind. 

It cannot see one race as equal to another. 

The VÖLKISCH concept separates mankind into races of superior and inferior quality. 

It conforms with the eternal Will that dominates the universe:
- the victory of the better and stronger
- the subordination of the inferior and weaker. 

It pays homage to the aristocratic principle underlying all Nature's operations.*

{{< n n="Here, Hitler recognizes that there is a hierarchy in Nature, but fails to see that the higher up you go, the more spiritual, loving, and less selfish and racist it becomes. He instead puts the crudest, cruel, and lowest beings to rule the hierarchy. This is why it collapsed much quicker than Marxism which is ignorant of any metaphysical hierarchy." >}}

It believes that this law holds good even down to the last individual organism. 

It selects individual values from the mass and thus operates as an organizing principle, whereas Marxism
acts as a disintegrating solvent. 

The VÖLKISCH belief holds that humanity must have its ideals, because ideals are a necessary condition of human existence itself. But, on the other hand, it denies that an ethical ideal has the right to prevail if it endangers the
existence of a race that is the standard-bearer of a higher ethical ideal. 

For in a world which would be composed of mongrels and negroids all ideals of human beauty and nobility and all hopes of an idealized future for our humanity would be lost forever.

On this planet of ours human culture and civilization are indissolubly bound up with the presence of the Aryan. If he should be exterminated or subjugated, then the dark shroud of a new barbarian era would enfold the earth.

To undermine the existence of human culture by exterminating its founders and
custodians would be an execrable crime in the eyes of those who believe that the folkidea lies at the basis of human existence. 

Whoever would dare to raise a profane hand against that highest image of God among His creatures would sin against the bountiful Creator of this marvel and would collaborate in the expulsion from Paradise.

Hence the folk concept of the world is in profound accord with Nature's will; because it restores the free play of the forces which will lead the race through stages of sustained reciprocal education towards a higher type, until finally the best portion of mankind will possess the earth and will be free to work in every domain all over the world and even reach spheres that lie outside the earth.

We all feel that in the distant future many may be faced with problems which can be solved only by a superior race of human beings, a race destined to become master of all the other peoples and which will have at its disposal the means and resources of the whole world.

Such a general sketch of the ideas implied in the folk concept of the world may easily be interpreted in a thousand different ways. As a matter of fact there is scarcely one of our recent political movements that does not refer at some point to this conception of the world. 

But the fact that this conception of the world still maintains its independent existence in face of all the others proves that their ways of looking at life are quite difierent from this. 

Thus the Marxist conception, directed by a central organization endowed with supreme authority, is opposed by a motley crew of opinions which is not very impressive in face of the solid phalanx presented by the
enemy. 

Victory cannot be achieved with such weak weapons. Only when the international idea, politically organized by Marxism, is confronted by the folk idea, equally well organized in a systematic way and equally well led--only then will the fighting energy in the one camp be able to meet that of the other on an equal footing; and victory will be found on the side of eternal truth.

But a general conception of life can never be given an organic embodiment until it is precisely and definitely formulated. The function which dogma fulfils in religious belief is parallel to the function which party principles fulfil for a political party which is in the process of being built up.

Therefore, for the conception of life that is based on the folk idea it is necessary that an instrument be forged which can be used in fighting for this ideal, similar to the Marxist party organization which clears the way for internationalism.

And this is the aim which the German National Socialist Labour Movement pursues.

The folk conception must therefore be definitely formulated so that it may be organically incorporated in the party. That is a necessary prerequisite for the success of this idea. And that it is so is very clearly proved even by the indirect acknowledgment of those who oppose such an amalgamation of the folk idea with party principles. 

The very people who never tire of insisting again and again that the conception of life based on the folk idea can never be the exclusive property of a single group, because it lies dormant or 'lives' in myriads of hearts, only confirm by their own statements the simple fact that the general presence of such ideas in the hearts of millions of men has not proved sufficient to impede the victory of the opposing ideas, which are championed by a political party organized on the principle of class conflict. 

If that were not so, the German people ought already to have gained a gigantic victory instead of finding themselves on the brink of the abyss. 

The international ideology achieved success because it was organized in a militant political party which was always ready to take the offensive. If hitherto the ideas opposed to the international concept have had to give way before the latter the reason is that they lacked a united front to fight for their cause.

A doctrine which forms a definite outlook on life cannot struggle and triumph by allowing the right of free interpretation of its general teaching, but only by defining that teaching in certain articles of faith that have to be accepted and incorporating it in a political organization.

Therefore I considered it my special duty to extract from the extensive but vague contents of a general WELTANSCHAUUNG the ideas which were essential and give them a more or less dogmatic form. Because of their precise and clear meaning, these
ideas are suited to the purpose of uniting in a common front all those who are ready to
accept them as principles. 

In other words: The German National Socialist Labour Party  extracts the essential principles from the general conception of the world which is based on the folk idea. 

On these principles it establishes a political doctrine which takes into account the practical realities of the day, the nature of the times, the available human material and all its deficiencies. Through this political doctrine it is possible to bring great masses of the people into an organization which is constructed as rigidly as it
could be. 

Such an organization is the main preliminary that is necessary for the final triumph of this ideal.
