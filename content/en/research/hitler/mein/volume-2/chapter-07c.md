The work of organizing the protective measures for our meetings was based on the following:

1. An energetic and psychologically judicious way of conducting the meeting.
2. An organized squad of troops to maintain order.

In those days we and no one else were masters of the situation at our meetings and on no occasion did we fail to emphasize this. Our opponents fully realized that any provocation would be the occasion of throwing them out of the hall at once, whatever
the odds against us. 

At meetings, particularly outside Munich, we had in those days from 500-800 hundred opponents against 15-16 National Socialists; yet we brooked no interference, for we were ready to be killed rather than capitulate. 

More than once a handful of party colleagues offered a heroic resistance to a raging and violent mob of Reds. Those fifteen or twenty men would certainly have been overwhelmed in the end had not the opponents known that three or four times as many of themselves would first get their skulls cracked. Arid that risk they were not willing to run. 

We had done our best to study Marxist and bourgeois methods of conducting meetings, and we had certainly learnt something.

The Marxists had always exercised a most rigid discipline so that the question of reaking up their meetings could never have originated in bourgeois quarters. This gave the Reds all the more reason for acting on this plan. In time they not only became  past-masters in this art but in certain large districts of the REICH they went so far as to declare that non-Marxist meetings were nothing less than a cause of' provocation
against the proletariat. 

This was particularly the case when the wire-pullers suspected that a meeting might call attention to their own transgressions and thus expose their own treachery and chicanery. Therefore the moment such a meeting was announced to
be held a howl of rage went up from the Red Press. These detractors of the law nearly
always turned first to the authorities and requested in imperative and threatening language that this 'provocation of the proletariat' be stopped forthwith in the 'interests of law and order'. 

Their language was chosen according to the importance of the official blockhead they were dealing with and thus success was assured. If by chance the official happened to be a true German--and not a mere figurehead--and he declined the impudent request, then the time-honoured appeal to stop 'provocation of the proletariat' was issued together with instructions to attend such and such a meeting on
a certain date in full strength for the purpose of 'putting a stop to the disgraceful
machinations of the bourgeoisie by means of the proletarian fist'.

The pitiful and frightened manner in which these bourgeois meetings are conducted must be seen in order to be believed. Very frequently these threats were sufficient to call off such a meeting at once. The feeling of fear was so marked that the meeting, instead of commencing at eight o'clock, very seldom was opened before a quarter to nine or nine o'clock. The Chairman thereupon did his best, by showering compliments on the
'gentleman of the opposition' to prove how he and all others present were pleased (a palpable lie) to welcome a visit from men who as yet were not in sympathy with them for the reason that only by mutual discussion (immediately agreed to) could they be
brought closer together in mutual understanding. Apart from this the Chairman also
assured them that the meeting had no intention whatsoever of interfering with the
professed convictions of anybody.

Indeed no. Everyone had the right to form and hold his own political views, but others should be allowed to do likewise. He therefore
requested that the speaker be allowed to deliver his speech without interruption--the
speech in any case not being a long affair. People abroad, he continued, would thus not
come to regard this meeting as another shameful example of the bitter fraternal strife
that is raging in Germany. And so on and so forth The brothers of the Left had little if any appreciation for that sort of talk; the speaker
had hardly commenced when he was shouted down. 

One gathered the impression at times that these speakers were graceful for being peremptorily cut short in their martyrlike discourse. These bourgeois toreadors left the arena in the midst of a vast uproar,
that is to say, provided that they were not thrown down the stairs with cracked skulls,
which was very often the case.

Therefore, our methods of organization at National Socialist meetings were something
quite strange to the Marxists. They came to our meetings in the belief that the little
game which they had so often played could as a matter of course be also repeated on us. 
"To-day we shall finish them off." How often did they bawl this out to each other on
entering the meeting hall, only to be thrown out with lightning speed before they had
time to repeat it.

In the first place our method of conducting a meeting was entirely different. We did not beg and pray to be allowed to speak, and we did not straightway give everybody the right to hold endless discussions. We curtly gave everyone to understand that we were
masters of the meeting and that we would do as it pleased us and that everyone who
dared to interrupt would be unceremoniously thrown out.

We stated clearly our refusal to accept responsibility for anyone treated in this manner. If time permitted and if it
suited us, a discussion would be allowed to take place. Our party colleague would now
make his speech.... That kind of talk was sufficient in itself to astonish the Marxists.
Secondly, we had at our disposal a well-trained and organized body of men for
maintaining order at our meetings.

On the other hand the bourgeois parties protected their meetings with a body of men better classified as ushers who by virtue of their age
thought they were entitled to-authority and respect. But as Marxism has little or no
respect for these things, the question of suitable self-protection at these bourgeois
meetings was, so to speak, in practice non-existent.

When our political meetings first started I made it a special point to organize a suitable
defensive squad--a squad composed chiefly of young men. Some of them were
comrades who had seen active service with me; others were young party members who,
right from the start, had been trained and brought up to realize that only terror is
capable of smashing terror--that only courageous and determined people had made a success of things in this world and that, finally, we were fighting for an idea so lofty that it was worth the last drop of our blood.

These young men had been brought up to realize that where force replaced common sense in the solution of a problem, the best
means of defence was attack and that the reputation of our hall-guard squads should
stamp us as a political fighting force and not as a debating society.
And it was extraordinary how eagerly these boys of the War generation responded to
this order. They had indeed good reason for being bitterly disappointed and indignant
at the miserable milksop methods employed by the bourgeoise.

Thus it became clear to everyone that the Revolution had only been possible thanks to
the dastardly methods of a bourgeois government. At that time there was certainly no
lack of man-power to suppress the revolution, but unfortunately there was an entire
lack of directive brain power. How often did the eyes of my young men light up with
enthusiasm when I explained to them the vital functions connected with their task and
assured them time and again that all earthly wisdom is useless unless it be supported
by a measure of strength, that the gentle goddess of Peace can only walk in company
with the god of War, and that every great act of peace must be protected and assisted by 
force. In this way the idea of military service came to them in a far more realistic form--
not in the fossilized sense of the souls of decrepit officials serving the dead authority of
a dead State, but in the living realization of the duty of each man to sacrifice his life at
all times so that his country might live.
How those young men did their job!

Like a swarm of hornets they tackled disturbers at our meetings, regardless of
superiority of numbers, however great, indifferent to wounds and bloodshed, inspired
with the great idea of blazing a trail for the sacred mission of our movement.
As early as the summer of 1920 the organization of squads of men as hall guards for
maintaining order at our meetings was gradually assuming definite shape. By the
spring of 1921 this body of men were sectioned off into squads of one hundred, which
in turn were sub-divided into smaller groups.
The urgency for this was apparent, as meanwhile the number of our meetings had
steadily increased. We still frequently met in the Munich Hofbr채uhaus but more
frequently in the large meeting halls throughout the city itself. In the autumn and
winter of 1920-1921 our meetings in the B체rgerbr채u and Munich Kindlbr채u had
assumed vast proportions and it was always the same picture that presented itself;
namely, meetings of the NSDAP (The German National Socialist Labour Party) were
always crowded out so that the police were compelled to close and bar the doors long
before proceedings commenced.
