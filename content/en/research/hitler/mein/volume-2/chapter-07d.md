The organization of defence guards for keeping order at our meetings cleared up a very ifficult question. Up till then the movement had possessed no party badge and no party flag. 

The lack of these tokens was not only a disadvantage at that time but would
prove intolerable in the future. The disadvantages were chiefly that members of the
party possessed no outward broken of membership which linked them together, and it
was absolutely unthinkable that for the future they should remain without some token
which would be a symbol of the movement and could be set against that of the
International.

More than once in my youth the psychological importance of such a symbol had
become clearly evident to me and from a sentimental point of view also it was
advisable. In Berlin, after the War, I was present at a mass-demonstration of Marxists in
front of the Royal Palace and in the Lustgarten. A sea of red flags, red armlets and red
flowers was in itself sufficient to give that huge assembly of about 120,000 persons an
outward appearance of strength. I was now able to feel and understand how easily the
man in the street succumbs to the hypnotic magic of such a grandiose piece of theatrical
presentation. 

The bourgeoisie, which as a party neither possesses or stands for any
WELTANSCHAUUNG, had therefore not a single banner. Their party was composed of
'patriots' who went about in the colours of the REICH. If these colours were the symbol
of a definite WELTANSCHAUUNG then one could understand the rulers of the State
regarding this flag as expressive of their own WELTANSCHAUUNG, seeing that
through their efforts the official REICH flag was expressive of their own
WELTANSCHAUUNG.
But in reality the position was otherwise.

The REICH was morticed together without the aid of the German bourgeoisie and the
flag itself was born of the War and therefore merely a State flag possessing no
importance in the sense of any particular ideological mission.
Only in one part of the German-speaking territory--in German-Austria--was there
anything like a bourgeois party flag in evidence. Here a section of the national
bourgeoisie selected the 1848 colours (black, red and gold) as their party flag and
therewith created a symbol which, though of no importance from a weltanschauliche
viewpoint, had, nevertheless, a revolutionary character from a national point of view.
The most bitter opponents of this flag at that time, and this should not be forgotten today, were the Social Democrats and the Christian Socialists or clericals. They, in particular, were the ones who degraded and besmirched these colours in the same way
as in 1918 they dragged black, white and red into the gutter. Of course, the black, red
and gold of the German parties in the old Austria were the colours of the year 1848: that
is to say, of a period likely to be regarded as somewhat visionary, but it was a period
that had honest German souls as its representatives, although the Jews were lurking
unseen as wire-pullers in the background. It was high treason and the shameful
enslavement of the German territory that first of all made these colours so attractive to
the Marxists of the Centre Party; so much so that to-day they revere them as their most
cherished possession and use them as their own banners for the protection of the flag
they once foully besmirched.

Up till 1920, in opposition to the Marxists, we had no flag that resisted them. 

The better political elements of the German bourgeoisie hated to accept the suddenly discovered black, red and gold colours as their symbol after 1918.

<!-- , they
nevertheless were incapable of counteracting this with a future programme of their own
that would correspond to the new trend of affairs.  -->

At the most, they had a reconstruction of the old REICH in mind.

And it is to this way of thinking that the black, white and red colours of the old REICH
are indebted for their resurrection as the flag of our so-called national bourgeois parties. 

The symbol of a régime overthrown by the Marxists under inglorious circumstances was not now worthy to serve as a banner under which the same Marxism was to be crushed in its turn. 

However much any decent German may love and revere those old colours, glorious when placed side by side in their
youthful freshness, when he had fought under them and seen the sacrifice of so many
lives, that flag had little value for the struggle of the future.

In our Movement I have always adopted the standpoint that it was a really lucky thing for the German nation that it had lost its old flag (Note 18). This standpoint of mine was in strong contrast to that of the bourgeois politicians. It may be immaterial to us what the Republic does under its flag. 

But let us be deeply grateful to fate for having so graciously spared the most glorious war flag for all time from becoming an ignominious rag. 

The REICH of today sells itself and its people. It must never be allowed to adopt the honourable and heroic black, white and red colours.

As long as the November outrage endures, that outrage may continue to bear its own
external sign and not steal that of an honourable past. Our bourgeois politicians should
awaken their consciences to the fact that whoever desires this State to have the black,
white and red colours is pilfering from the past. The old flag was suitable only for the
old REICH and, thank Heaven, the Republic chose the colours best suited to itself.

This was also the reason why we National Socialists recognized that hoisting the old
colours would be no symbol of our special aims; for we had no wish to resurrect from
the dead the old REICH which had been ruined through its own blunders, but to build
up a new State.

The Movement which is fighting Marxism to-day along these lines must display on its
banner the symbol of the new State.

The question of the new flag, that is to say the form and appearance it must take, kept
us very busy in those days. Suggestions poured in from all quarters, which although
well meant were more or less impossible in practice. The new flag had not only to
become a symbol expressing our own struggle but on the other hand it was necessary
that it should prove effective as a large poster. All those who busy themselves with the
tastes of the public will recognize and appreciate the great importance of these
apparently petty matters. In hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem
may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement.

For this reason we declined all suggestions from various quarters for identifying our
movement by means of a white flag with the old State or rather with those decrepit
parties whose sole political objective is the restoration of past conditions. And, apart
from this, white is not a colour capable of attracting and focusing public attention. It is a 
colour suitable only for young women's associations and not for a movement that
stands for reform in a revolutionary period.

Black was also suggested--certainly well-suited to the times, but embodying no
significance to empress the will behind our movement. And, finally, black is incapable
of attracting attention.

White and blue was discarded, despite its admirable aesthetic appeal--as being the
colours of an individual German Federal State--a State that, unfortunately, through its
political attitude of particularist narrow-mindedness did not enjoy a good reputation.
And, generally speaking, with these colours it would have been difficult to attract
attention to our movement. The same applies to black and white.
Black, red and gold did not enter the question at all.

And this also applies to black, white and red for reasons already stated. At least, not in
the form hitherto in use. But the effectiveness of these three colours is far superior to all
the others and they are certainly the most strikingly harmonious combination to be
found.

I myself was always for keeping the old colours, not only because I, as a soldier,
regarded them as my most sacred possession, but because in their aesthetic effect, they
conformed more than anything else to my personal taste. 

Accordingly, I had to discard all the innumerable suggestions and designs which had been proposed for the new movement, among which were many that had incorporated the swastika into the old colours. 

I, as leader, was unwilling to make public my own design, as it was possible
that someone else could come forward with a design just as good, if not better, than my
own. As a matter of fact, a dental surgeon from Starnberg submitted a good design very
similar to mine, with only one mistake, in that his swastika with curved corners was set
upon a white background.

After innumerable trials I decided upon a final form--a flag of red material with a white
disc bearing in its centre a black swastika. After many trials I obtained the correct
proportions between the dimensions of the flag and of the white central disc, as well as
that of the swastika. And this is how it has remained ever since.

At the same time we immediately ordered the corresponding armlets for our squad of
men who kept order at meetings, armlets of red material, a central white disc with the
black swastika upon it. Herr Füss, a Munich goldsmith, supplied the first practical and
permanent design.

The new flag appeared in public in the midsummer of 1920. It suited our movement
admirably, both being new and young. Not a soul had seen this flag before; its effect at 
that time was something akin to that of a blazing torch. We ourselves experienced
almost a boyish delight when one of the ladies of the party who had been entrusted
with the making of the flag finally handed it over to us. And a few months later those of
us in Munich were in possession of six of these flags. The steadily increasing strength of
our hall guards was a main factor in popularizing the symbol.
And indeed a symbol it proved to be.

Not only because it incorporated those revered colours expressive of our homage to the
glorious past and which once brought so much honour to the German nation, but this
symbol was also an eloquent expression of the will behind the movement. We National
Socialists regarded our flag as being the embodiment of our party programme. The red
expressed the social thought underlying the movement. White the national thought.
And the swastika signified the mission allotted to us--the struggle for the victory of
Aryan mankind and at the same time the triumph of the ideal of creative work which is
in itself and always will be anti-Semitic.

Two years later, when our squad of hall guards had long since grown into storm
detachments, it seemed necessary to give this defensive organization of a young
WELTANSCHAUUNG a particular symbol of victory, namely a Standard. I also
designed this and entrusted the execution of it to an old party comrade, Herr Gahr, who
was a goldsmith. Ever since that time this Standard has been the distinctive token of the
National Socialist struggle.

The increasing interest taken in our meetings, particularly during 1920, compelled us at
times to hold two meetings a week. Crowds gathered round our posters; the large
meeting halls in the town were always filled and tens of thousands of people, who had
been led astray by the teachings of Marxism, found their way to us and assisted in the
work of fighting for the liberation of the REICH. The public in Munich had got to know
us. We were being spoken about. The words 'National Socialist' had become common
property to many and signified for them a definite party programme. Our circle of
supporters and even of members was constantly increasing, so that in the winter of
1920-21 we were able to appear as a strong party in Munich.

At that time there was no party in Munich with the exception of the Marxist parties--
certainly no nationalist party--which was able to hold such mass demonstrations as
ours. The Munich Kindl Hall, which held 5,000 people, was more than once
overcrowded and up till then there was only one other hall, the Krone Circus Hall, into
which we had not ventured.

At the end of January 1921 there was again great cause for anxiety in Germany. The
Paris Agreement, by which Germany pledged herself to pay the crazy sum of a hundred
milliards of gold marks, was to be confirmed by the London Ultimatum. 
Thereupon an old-established Munich working committee, representative of so-called
VÖLKISCH groups, deemed it advisable to call for a public meeting of protest. I became
nervous and restless when I saw that a lot of time was being wasted and nothing
undertaken. At first a meeting was suggested in the KÖNIG PLATZ; on second
thoughts this was turned down, as someone feared the proceedings might be wrecked
by Red elements. Another suggestion was a demonstration in front of the Feldherrn
Hall, but this also came to nothing. Finally a combined meeting in the Munich Kindl
Hall was suggested. Meanwhile, day after day had gone by; the big parties had entirely
ignored the terrible event, and the working committee could not decide on a definite
date for holding the demonstration.

On Tuesday, February 1st, I put forward an urgent demand for a final decision. I was
put off until Wednesday. On that day I demanded to be told clearly if and when the
meeting was to take place. The reply was again uncertain and evasive, it being stated
that it was 'intended' to arrange a demonstration that day week.
At that I lost all patience and decided to conduct a demonstration of protest on my own.
At noon on Wednesday I dictated in ten minutes the text of the poster and at the same
time hired the Krone Circus Hall for the next day, February 3rd.

In those days this was a tremendous venture. Not only because of the uncertainty of
filling that vast hall, but also because of the risk of the meeting being wrecked.
Numerically our squad of hall guards was not strong enough for this vast hall. I was
also uncertain about what to do in case the meeting was broken up--a huge circus
building being a different proposition from an ordinary meeting hall. But events
showed that my fears were misplaced, the opposite being the case. In that vast building
a squad of wreckers could be tackled and subdued more easily than in a cramped hall.
One thing was certain: A failure would throw us back for a long time to come. If one
meeting was wrecked our prestige would be seriously injured and our opponents
would be encouraged to repeat their success. That would lead to sabotage of our work
in connection with further meetings and months of difficult struggle would be
necessary to overcome this.

We had only one day in which to post our bills, Thursday. Unfortunately it rained on
the morning of that day and there was reason to fear that many people would prefer to
remain at home rather than hurry to a meeting through rain and snow, especially when
there was likely to be violence and bloodshed.

And indeed on that Thursday morning I was suddenly struck with fear that the hall
might never be filled to capacity, which would have made me ridiculous in the eyes of 
the working committee. I therefore immediately dictated various leaflets, had them
printed and distributed in the afternoon. Of course they contained an invitation to
attend the meeting.

Two lorries which I hired were draped as much as possible in red, each had our new
flag hoisted on it and was then filled with fifteen or twenty members of our party.
Orders were given the members to canvas the streets thoroughly, distribute leaflets and
conduct propaganda for the mass meeting to be held that evening. It was the first time
that lorries had driven through the streets bearing flags and not manned by Marxists.
The public stared open-mouthed at these red-draped cars, and in the outlying districts
clenched fists were angrily raised at this new evidence of 'provocation of the
proletariat'. Were not the Marxists the only ones entitled to hold meetings and drive
about in motor lorries?

At seven o'clock in the evening only a few had gathered in the circus hall. I was being
kept informed by telephone every ten minutes and was becoming uneasy. Usually at
seven or a quarter past our meeting halls were already half filled; sometimes even
packed. But I soon found out the reason why I was uneasy. I had entirely forgotten to
take into account the huge dimensions of this new meeting place. A thousand people in
the Hofbräuhaus was quite an impressive sight, but the same number in the Circus
building was swallowed up in its dimensions and was hardly noticeable. Shortly
afterwards I received more hopeful reports and at a quarter to eight I was informed that
the hall was three-quarters filled, with huge crowds still lined up at the pay boxes. I
then left for the meeting.

I arrived at the Circus building at two minutes past eight. There was still a crowd of
people outside, partly inquisitive people and many opponents who preferred to wait
outside for developments.
When I entered the great hall I felt the same joy I had felt a year previously at the first
meeting in the Munich Hofbräu Banquet Hall; but it was not until I had forced my way
through the solid wall of people and reached the platform that I perceived the full
measure of our success. The hall was before me, like a huge shell, packed with
thousands and thousands of people. Even the arena was densely crowded. More than
5,600 tickets had been sold and, allowing for the unemployed, poor students and our
own detachments of men for keeping order, a crowd of about 6,500 must have been
present.

My theme was 'Future or Downfall' and I was filled with joy at the conviction that the future was represented by the crowds that I was addressing.

I began, and spoke for about two and a half hours. I had the feeling after the first halfhour that the meeting was going to be a big success. Contact had been at once  established with all those thousands of individuals.

After the first hour the speech was already being received by spontaneous outbreaks of applause, but after the second hour
this died down to a solemn stillness which I was to experience so often later on in this
same hall, and which will for ever be remembered by all those present. Nothing broke
this impressive silence and only when the last word had been spoken did the meeting
give vent to its feelings by singing the national anthem.

I watched the scene during the next twenty minutes, as the vast hall slowly emptied itself, and only then did I leave the platform, a happy man, and made my way home.

Photographs were taken of this first meeting in the Krone Circus Hall in Munich. They are more eloquent than words to demonstrate the success of this demonstration. The bourgeois papers reproduced photographs and reported the meeting as having been
merely 'nationalist' in character; in their usual modest fashion they omitted all mention
of its promoters.

Thus for the first time we had developed far beyond the dimensions of an ordinary party. We could no longer be ignored. And to dispel all doubt that the meeting was merely an isolated success, I immediately arranged for another at the Circus Hall in the following week, and again we had the same success. Once more the vast hall was overflowing with people; so much so that I decided to hold a third meeting during the following week, which also proved a similar success.

After these initial successes early in 1921 I increased our activity in Munich still further.
I not only held meetings once a week, but during some weeks even two were regularly held and very often during midsummer and autumn this increased to three. We met regularly at the Circus Hall and it gave us great satisfaction to see that every meeting brought us the same measure of success.

The result was shown in an ever-increasing number of supporters and members into our party.

Naturally, such success did not allow our opponents to sleep soundly. At first their tactics fluctuated between the use of terror and silence in our regard. Then they recognized that neither terror nor silence could hinder the progress of our movement.

So they had recourse to a supreme act of terror which was intended to put a definite end to our activities in the holding of meetings.

As a pretext for action along this line they availed themselves of a very mysterious attack on one of the Landtag deputies, named Erhard Auer. It was declared that someone had fired several shots at this man one evening. This meant that he was not shot but that an attempt had been made to shoot him. A fabulous presence of mind and heroic courage on the part of Social Democratic leaders not only prevented the  sacrilegious intention from taking effect but also put the crazy would-be assassins to flight, like the cowards that they were. They were so quick and fled so far that subsequently the police could not find even the slightest traces of them. This mysterious episode was used by the organ of the Social Democratic Party to arouse public feeling against the movement, and while doing this it delivered its old rigmarole about the tactics that were to be employed the next time. Their purpose was to see to it that our movement should not grow but should be immediately hewn down root and branch by the hefty arm of the proletariat.

A few days later the real attack came. It was decided finally to interrupt one of our
meetings which was billed to take place in the Munich Hofbräuhaus, and at which I
myself was to speak.
