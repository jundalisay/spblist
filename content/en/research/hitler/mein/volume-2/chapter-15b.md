In November 1918 Germany collapsed with lightning suddenness.

But when the catastrophe took place at home, our armies were still deep in the enemy's country. 

At that time France's first preoccupation was not the dismemberment of Germany but the problem of how to get the German armies out of France and Belgium as quickly as possible. 

And so, in order to put an end to the War, the first thing that had to be done by the Paris Government was to disarm the German armies and push them back into Germany if possible. 

Until this was done the French could not devote their attention to carrying out their own particular and original war aims. 


As far as concerned England, the War was really won when Germany was destroyed as a colonial and commercial Power and was reduced to the rank of a second-class State.

It was not in England's interest to wipe out the German State altogether.

In fact, on many grounds it was desirable for her to have a future rival against France in Europe. 

Therefore French policy was forced to carry on by peaceful means the work for which the War had  opened the way; and Clemenceau's statement, that for him Peace was merely a continuation of the War, thus acquired an enhanced significance.

Persistently and on every opportunity that arose, the effort to dislocate the framework of the REICH was to have been carried on. 

By perpetually sending new notes that demanded disarmament, on the one hand, and by the imposition of economic levies which, on the other hand, could be carried out as the process of disarmament progressed, it was hoped in Paris that the framework of the REICH would gradually fall to pieces. 

The more the Germans lost their sense of national honour the more could economic pressure and continued economic distress be effective as factors of political destruction.

Such a policy of political oppression and economic exploitation, carried out for ten or twenty years, must in the long run steadily ruin the most compact national body and, under certain circumstances, dismember it. Then the French war aims would have been definitely attained.

By the winter of 1922-23 the French intentions were already known for a long time back. 

There remained only 2 ways of confronting the situation.

1. If the German nation were tough-skinned, it might gradually blunt the French will

2. It could turn roundabout and ram the enemy

 <!-- it might do--once and for all--what was bound to become inevitable one day: that is to say, under the provocation of some particularly brutal act of oppression it could put the helm of the German ship of state to .  -->

This would naturally involve a life-and-death-struggle. 

We could win if France could be isolated that in this second battle Germany would not have to fight against the whole world, but in defence of Germany against a France.

 <!-- that was persistently disturbing the peace of the world. -->

This second alternative will one day be chosen. 

France will never alter her intentions towards us, because they are only the expression of the French instinct for self-preservation. 

Were I a Frenchman and were the greatness of France so dear to me as that of Germany actually is, in the final reckoning I could not and would not act otherwise than a Clemenceau. The French nation, which is slowly dying out, not so much through depopulation as through the progressive disappearance of the best elements of the race, can continue to play an important role in the world only if Germany be destroyed. 

French policy may make a thousand detours on the march towards its fixed goal, but the destruction of Germany is the end which it always has in view as the fulfilment of the most profound yearning and ultimate intentions of the French. 

Now it is a mistake to believe that if the will on one side should remain only PASSIVE and intent on its own self-preservation it can hold out permanently against another will which is not less forceful but is ACTIVE. As long as the eternal conflict between France and Germany is waged only in the form of a German defence against the French attack, that conflict can never be decided; and from century to century
Germany will lose one position after another. 

If we study the changes that have taken place, from the twelfth century up to our day, in the frontiers within which the German language is spoken, we can hardly hope for a successful issue to result from the acceptance and development of a line of conduct which has hitherto been so detrimental for us.

Only when the Germans have taken all this fully into account will they cease from allowing the national will-to-life to wear itself out in merely passive defence, but they will rally together for a last decisive contest with France. 

In this contest the essential objective of the German nation will be fought for. Only then will it be possible to put an end to the eternal Franco-German conflict which has hitherto proved so sterile. Of course it is here presumed that Germany sees in the suppression of France nothing more than a means which will make it possible for our people finally to expand in another quarter. To-day there are eighty million Germans in Europe. 

Our foreign policy will be recognized as rightly conducted only when, after barely a hundred years, there will be 250 million Germans living on this Continent, not packed together as the coolies in the factories of another Continent but as tillers of the soil and workers whose labour will be a mutual assurance for their existence.

In December 1922 the situation between Germany and France assumed a particularly threatening aspect. France had new and vast oppressive measures in view and needed sanctions for her conduct. Political pressure had to precede the economic plunder, and the French believed that only by making a violent attack against the central nervous system of German life would they be able to make our 'recalcitrant' people bow to their
galling yoke. 

By the occupation of the Ruhr District, it was hoped in France that not only would the moral backbone of Germany be broken finally but that we should be reduced to such a grave economic condition that we should be forced, for weal or woe, to subscribe to the heaviest possible obligations.

It was a question of bending and breaking Germany. At first Germany bent and subsequently broke in pieces completely.

Through the occupation of the Ruhr, Fate once more reached out its hand to the German people and bade them arise. For what at first appeared as a heavy stroke of misfortune was found, on closer examination, to contain extremely encouraging possibilities of bringing Germany's sufferings to an end.

As regards foreign politics, the action of France in occupying the Ruhr really estranged
England for the first time in quite a profound way. Indeed it estranged not merely
British diplomatic circles, which had concluded the French alliance and had upheld it
from motives of calm and objective calculation, but it also estranged large sections of
the English nation. The English business world in particular scarcely concealed the 
displeasure it felt at this incredible forward step in strengthening the power of France
on the Continent. From the military standpoint alone France now assumed a position in
Europe such as Germany herself had not held previously.

Moreover, France thus obtained control over economic resources which practically gave her a monopoly that
consolidated her political and commercial strength against all competition. The most
important iron and coal mines of Europe were now united in the hand of one nation
which, in contrast to Germany, had hitherto defended her vital interests in an active and
resolute fashion and whose military efficiency in the Great War was still fresh in the
memories of the whole world. The French occupation of the Ruhr coal field deprived
England of all the successes she had gained in the War. And the victors were now
Marshal Foch and the France he represented, no longer the calm and painstaking British
statesmen.

In Italy also the attitude towards France, which had not been very favourable since the
end of the War, now became positively hostile. The great historic moment had come
when the Allies of yesterday might become the enemies of to-morrow. If things
happened otherwise and if the Allies did not suddenly come into conflict with one
another, as in the Second Balkan War, that was due to the fact that Germany had no
Enver Pasha but merely a Cuno as Chancellor of the REICH.

Nevertheless, the French invasion of the Ruhr opened up great possibilities for the
future not only in Germany's foreign politics but also in her internal politics. A
considerable section of our people who, thanks to the persistent influence of a
mendacious Press, had looked upon France as the champion of progress and liberty,
were suddenly cured of this illusion. In 1914 the dream of international solidarity
suddenly vanished from the brain of our German working class. They were brought
back into the world of everlasting struggle, where one creature feeds on the other and
where the death of the weaker implies the life of the stronger. The same thing happened
in the spring of 1923.

When the French put their threats into effect and penetrated, at first hesitatingly and
cautiously, into the coal-basin of Lower Germany the hour of destiny had struck for
Germany. It was a great and decisive moment. If at that moment our people had
changed not only their frame of mind but also their conduct the German Ruhr District
could have been made for France what Moscow turned out to be for Napoleon. Indeed,
there were only two possibilities: either to leave this move also to take its course and do
nothing or to turn to the German people in that region of sweltering forges and flaming
furnaces. An effort might have been made to set their wills afire with determination to
put an end to this persistent disgrace and to face a momentary terror rather than submit
to a terror that was endless. 

Cuno, who was then Chancellor of the REICH, can claim the immortal merit of having
discovered a third way; and our German bourgeois political parties merit the still more
glorious honour of having admired him and collaborated with him.

Here I shall deal with the second way as briefly as possible.

By occupying the Ruhr France committed a glaring violation of the Versailles Treaty.
Her action brought her into conflict with several of the guarantor Powers, especially
with England and Italy. She could no longer hope that those States would back her up
in her egotistic act of brigandage. She could count only on her own forces to reap
anything like a positive result from that adventure, for such it was at the start. For a
German National Government there was only one possible way left open. And this was
the way which honour prescribed. Certainly at the beginning we could not have
opposed France with an active armed resistance. 

But it should have been clearly
recognized that any negotiations which did not have the argument of force to back
them up would turn out futile and ridiculous. If it were not possible to organize an
active resistance, then it was absurd to take up the standpoint: "We shall not enter into
any negotiations." But it was still more absurd finally to enter into negotiations without
having organized the necessary force as a support.

Not that it was possible for us by military means to prevent the occupation of the Ruhr.
Only a madman could have recommended such a decision. But under the impression
produced by the action which France had taken, and during the time that it was being
carried out, measures could have been, and should have been, undertaken without any
regard to the Versailles Treaty, which France herself had violated, to provide those
military resources which would serve as a collateral argument to back up the
negotiations later on. For it was quite clear from the beginning that the fate of this
district occupied by the French would one day be decided at some conference table or
other. But it also must have been quite to everybody that even the best negotiators
could have little success as long as the ground on which they themselves stood and the
chair on which they sat were not under the armed protection of their own people. 

A
weak pigmy cannot contend against athletes, and a negotiator without any armed
defence at his back must always bow in obeisance when a Brennus throws the sword
into the scales on the enemy's side, unless an equally strong sword can be thrown into
the scales at the other end and thus maintain the balance. It was really distressing to
have to observe the comedy of negotiations which, ever since 1918, regularly preceded
each arbitrary dictate that the enemy imposed upon us. We offered a sorry spectacle to
the eyes of the whole world when we were invited, for the sake of derision, to attend
conference tables simply to be presented with decisions and programmes which had
already been drawn up and passed a long time before, and which we were permitted to
discuss, but from the beginning had to be considered as unalterable. It is true that in
scarcely a single instance were our negotiators men of more than mediocre abilities. For
the most part they justified only too well the insolent observation made by Lloyd 
George when he sarcastically remarked, in the presence of a former Chancellor of the
REICH, Herr Simon, that the Germans were not able to choose men of intelligence as
their leaders and representatives. But in face of the resolute determination and the
power which the enemy held in his hands, on the one side, and the lamentable
impotence of Germany on the other, even a body of geniuses could have obtained only
very little for Germany.

In the spring of 1923, however, anyone who might have thought of seizing the
opportunity of the French invasion of the Ruhr to reconstruct the military power of
Germany would first have had to restore to the nation its moral weapons, to reinforce
its will-power, and to extirpate those who had destroyed this most valuable element of
national strength.

Just as in 1918 we had to pay with our blood for the failure to crush the Marxist serpent
underfoot once and for all in 1914 and 1915, now we have to suffer retribution for the
fact that in the spring of 1923 we did not seize the opportunity then offered us for
finally wiping out the handiwork done by the Marxists who betrayed their country and
were responsible for the murder of our people.

Any idea of opposing French aggression with an efficacious resistance was only pure
folly as long as the fight had not been taken up against those forces which, five years
previously, had broken the German resistance on the battlefields by the influences
which they exercised at home. Only bourgeois minds could have arrived at the
incredible belief that Marxism had probably become quite a different thing now and
that the CANAILLE of ringleaders in 1918, who callously used the bodies of our two
million dead as stepping-stones on which they climbed into the various Government
positions, would now, in the year 1923, suddenly show themselves ready to pay their
tribute to the national conscience. It was veritably a piece of incredible folly to expect
that those traitors would suddenly appear as the champions of German freedom. They
had no intention of doing it. Just as a hyena will not leave its carrion, a Marxist will not
give up indulging in the betrayal of his country. It is out of the question to put forward
the stupid retort here, that so many of the workers gave their blood for Germany.
German workers, yes, but no longer international Marxists.
