The REICH conducted its foreign affairs erratically due to a lack of sound guiding principles for the formation of practical and useful alliances. 

Not only was this state of affairs continued after the Revolution, but it became even worse.

Our defective statesmanship was caused by the confused state of our political ideas before the War.

But in the post-War period the cause is a lack of honest intentions. 

It was natural that those parties
who had fully achieved their destructive purpose by means of the Revolution should
feel that it would not serve their interests if a policy of alliances were adopted which
must ultimately result in the restoration of a free German State. 

A development in this direction would not be in conformity with the purposes of the November crime. 

It would have interrupted and indeed put an end to the internationalization of German
national economy and German Labour. 

But what was feared most of all was that a successful effort to make the REICH independent of foreign countries might have an influence in domestic politics which one day would turn out disastrous for those who
now hold supreme power in the government of the REICH. 

One cannot imagine the revival of a nation unless that revival be preceded by a process of nationalization.
Conversely, every important success in the field of foreign politics must call forth a
favourable reaction at home. 

Experience proves that every struggle for liberty increases the national sentiment and national self-consciousness and therewith gives rise to a keener sensibility towards anti-national elements and tendencies. A state of things, and
persons also, that may be tolerated and even pass unnoticed in times of peace will not
only become the object of aversion when national enthusiasm is aroused but will even
provoke positive opposition, which frequently turns out disastrous for them. In this
connection we may recall the spy-scare that became prevalent when the war broke out,
when human passion suddenly manifested itself to such a heightened degree as to lead
to the most brutal persecutions, often without any justifiable grounds, although
everybody knew that the danger resulting from spies is greater during the long periods
of peace; but, for obvious reasons, they do not then attract a similar amount of public
attention. For this reason the subtle instinct of the State parasites who came to the
surface of the national body through the November happenings makes them feel at
once that a policy of alliances which would restore the freedom of our people and
awaken national sentiment might possibly ruin their own criminal existence. 
Thus we may explain the fact that since 1918 the men who have held the reins of
government adopted an entirely negative attitude towards foreign affairs and that the
business of the State has been almost constantly conducted in a systematic way against
the interests of the German nation. For that which at first sight seemed a matter of
chance proved, on closer examination, to be a logical advance along the road which was
first publicly entered upon by the November Revolution of 1918.

Undoubtedly a distinction ought to be made between (1) the responsible administrators
of our affairs of State, or rather those who ought to be responsible; (2) the average run of
our parliamentary politicasters, and (3) the masses of our people, whose sheepish
docility corresponds to their want of intelligence.

The first know what they want. The second fall into line with them, either because they
have been already schooled in what is afoot or because they have not the courage to
take an uncompromising stand against a course which they know and feel to be
detrimental. The third just submit to it because they are too stupid to understand.
While the German National Socialist Labour Party was only a small and practically
unknown society, problems of foreign policy could have only a secondary importance
in the eyes of many of its members. This was the case especially because our movement
has always proclaimed the principle, and must proclaim it, that the freedom of the
country in its foreign relations is not a gift that will be bestowed upon us by Heaven or
by any earthly Powers, but can only be the fruit of a development of our inner forces.
We must first root out the causes which led to our collapse and we must eliminate all
those who are profiting by that collapse. Then we shall be in a position to take up the
fight for the restoration of our freedom in the management of our foreign relations.
It will be easily understood therefore why we did not attach so much importance to
foreign affairs during the early stages of our young movement, but preferred to
concentrate on the problem of internal reform.

But when the small and insignificant society expanded and finally grew too large for its
first framework, the young organization assumed the importance of a great association
and we then felt it incumbent on us to take a definite stand on problems regarding the
development of a foreign policy. It was necessary to lay down the main lines of action
which would not only be in accord with the fundamental ideas of our
WELTANSCHAUUNG but would actually be an expansion of it in the practical world
of foreign affairs.

Just because our people have had no political education in matters concerning our
relations abroad, it was necessary to teach the leaders in the various sections of our
movement, and also the masses of the people, the chief principles which ought to guide 
the development of our foreign relations. That was one of the first tasks to be
accomplished in order to prepare the ground for the practical carrying out of a foreign
policy which would win back the independence of the nation in managing its external
affairs and thus restore the real sovereignty of the REICH.
The fundamental and guiding principles which we must always bear in mind when
studying this question is that foreign policy is only a means to an end and that the sole
end to be pursued is the welfare of our own people. Every problem in foreign politics
must be considered from this point of view, and this point of view alone. Shall such and
such a solution prove advantageous to our people now or in the future, or will it injure
their interests? That is the question.

This is the sole preoccupation that must occupy our minds in dealing with a question.
Party politics, religious considerations, humanitarian ideals--all such and all other
preoccupations must absolutely give way to this.

Before the War the purpose to which German foreign policy should have been devoted
was to assure the supply of material necessities for the maintenance of our people and
their children. And the way should have been prepared which would lead to this goal.
Alliances should have been established which would have proved beneficial to us from
this point of view and would have brought us the necessary auxiliary support. The task
to be accomplished is the same to-day, but with this difference: In pre-War times it was
a question of caring for the maintenance of the German people, backed up by the power
which a strong and independent State then possessed, but our task to-day is to make
our nation powerful once again by re-establishing a strong and independent State. The
re-establishment of such a State is the prerequisite and necessary condition which must
be fulfilled in order that we may be able subsequently to put into practice a foreign
policy which will serve to guarantee the existence of our people in the future, fulfilling
their needs and furnishing them with those necessities of life which they lack. In other
words, the aim which Germany ought to pursue to-day in her foreign policy is to
prepare the way for the recovery of her liberty to-morrow. In this connection there is a
fundamental principle which we must keep steadily before our minds. It is this: The
possibility of winning back the independence of a nation is not absolutely bound up
with the question of territorial reintegration but it will suffice if a small remnant, no
matter how small, of this nation and State will exist, provided it possesses the necessary
independence to become not only the vehicle of' the common spirit of the whole people
but also to prepare the way for the military fight to reconquer the nation's liberty.
When a people who amount to a hundred million souls tolerate the yoke of common
slavery in order to prevent the territory belonging to their State from being broken up
and divided, that is worse than if such a State and such a people were dismembered
while one fragment still retained its complete independence. Of course, the natural
proviso here is that this fragment must be inspired with a consciousness of the solemn 
duty that devolves upon it, not only to proclaim persistently the inviolable unity of its
spiritual and cultural life with that of its detached members but also to prepare the
means that are necessary for the military conflict which will finally liberate and re-unite
the fragments that are suffering under oppression.

One must also bear in mind the fact that the restoration of lost districts which were
formerly parts of the State, both ethnically and politically, must in the first instance be a
question of winning back political power and independence for the motherland itself,
and that in such cases the special interests of the lost districts must be
uncompromisingly regarded as a matter of secondary importance in the face of the one
main task, which is to win back the freedom of the central territory. For the detached
and oppressed fragments of a nation or an imperial province cannot achieve their
liberation through the expression of yearnings and protests on the part of the oppressed
and abandoned, but only when the portion which has more or less retained its
sovereign independence can resort to the use of force for the purpose of reconquering
those territories that once belonged to the common fatherland.

Therefore, in order to reconquer lost territories the first condition to be fulfilled is to
work energetically for the increased welfare and reinforcement of the strength of that
portion of the State which has remained over after the partition. Thus the unquenchable
yearning which slumbers in the hearts of the people must be awakened and
restrengthened by bringing new forces to its aid, so that when the hour comes all will be
devoted to the one purpose of liberating and uniting the whole people. Therefore, the
interests of the separated territories must be subordinated to the one purpose. That one
purpose must aim at obtaining for the central remaining portion such a measure of
power and might that will enable it to enforce its will on the hostile will of the victor
and thus redress the wrong. For flaming protests will not restore the oppressed
territories to the bosom of a common REICH. That can be done only through the might
of the sword.
The forging of this sword is a work that has to be done through the domestic policy
which must be adopted by a national government. To see that the work of forging these
arms is assured, and to recruit the men who will bear them, that is the task of the
foreign policy.

In the first volume of this book I discussed the inadequacy of our policy of alliances
before the War. There were four possible ways to secure the necessary foodstuffs for the
maintenance of our people. Of these ways the fourth, which was the most unfavourable,
was chosen. Instead of a sound policy of territorial expansion in Europe, our rulers
embarked on a policy of colonial and trade expansion. That policy was all the more
mistaken inasmuch as they presumed that in this way the danger of an armed conflict
would be averted. The result of the attempt to sit on many stools at the same time might
have been foreseen. It let us fall to the ground in the midst of them all. And the World 
War was only the last reckoning presented to the REICH to pay for the failure of its
foreign policy.

The right way that should have been taken in those days was the third way I indicated:
namely, to increase the strength of the REICH as a Continental Power by the acquisition
of new territory in Europe. And at the same time a further expansion, through the
subsequent acquisition of colonial territory, might thus be brought within the range of
practical politics. Of course, this policy could not have been carried through except in
alliance with England, or by devoting such abnormal efforts to the increase of military
force and armament that, for forty or fifty years, all cultural undertakings would have
to be completely relegated to the background. This responsibility might very well have
been undertaken. The cultural importance of a nation is almost always dependent on its
political freedom and independence. Political freedom is a prerequisite condition for the
existence, or rather the creation, of great cultural undertakings. Accordingly no sacrifice
can be too great when there is question of securing the political freedom of a nation.
What might have to be deducted from the budget expenses for cultural purposes, in
order to meet abnormal demands for increasing the military power of the State, can be
generously paid back later on. Indeed, it may be said that after a State has concentrated
all its resources in one effort for the purpose of securing its political independence a
certain period of ease and renewed equilibrium sets in. And it often happens that the
cultural spirit of the nation, which had been heretofore cramped and confined, now
suddenly blooms forth. Thus Greece experienced the great Periclean era after the
miseries it had suffered during the Persian Wars. And the Roman Republic turned its
energies to the cultivation of a higher civilization when it was freed from the stress and
worry of the Punic Wars.

Of course, it could not be expected that a parliamentary majority of feckless and stupid
people would be capable of deciding on such a resolute policy for the absolute
subordination of all other national interests to the one sole task of preparing for a future
conflict of arms which would result in establishing the security of the State. The father
of Frederick the Great sacrificed everything in order to be ready for that conflict; but the
fathers of our absurd parliamentarian democracy, with the Jewish hall-mark, could not
do it.

That is why, in pre-War times, the military preparation necessary to enable us to
conquer new territory in Europe was only very mediocre, so that it was difficult to
obtain the support of really helpful allies.
Those who directed our foreign affairs would not entertain even the idea of
systematically preparing for war. They rejected every plan for the acquisition of
territory in Europe. And by preferring a policy of colonial and trade expansion, they
sacrificed the alliance with England, which was then possible. At the same time they
neglected to seek the support of Russia, which would have been a logical proceeding. 
Finally they stumbled into the World War, abandoned by all except the ill-starred
Habsburgs.
The characteristic of our present foreign policy is that it follows no discernible or even
intelligible lines of action. Whereas before the War a mistake was made in taking the
fourth way that I have mentioned, and this was pursued only in a halfhearted manner,
since the Revolution not even the sharpest eye can detect any way that is being
followed. Even more than before the War, there is absolutely no such thing as a
systematic plan, except the systematic attempts that are made to destroy the last
possibility of a national revival.
If we make an impartial examination of the situation existing in Europe to-day as far as
concerns the relation of the various Powers to one another, we shall arrive at the
following results:

For the past three hundred years the history of our Continent has been definitely
determined by England's efforts to keep the European States opposed to one another in
an equilibrium of forces, thus assuring the necessary protection of her own rear while
she pursued the great aims of British world-policy.
The traditional tendency of British diplomacy ever since the reign of Queen Elizabeth
has been to employ systematically every possible means to prevent any one Power from
attaining a preponderant position over the other European Powers and, if necessary, to
break that preponderance by means of armed intervention. The only parallel to this has
been the tradition of the Prussian Army. England has made use of various forces to
carry out its purpose, choosing them according to the actual situation or the task to be
faced; but the will and determination to use them has always been the same. The more
difficult England's position became in the course of history the more the British
Imperial Government considered it necessary to maintain a condition of political
paralysis among the various European States, as a result of their mutual rivalries. When
the North American colonies obtained their political independence it became still more
necessary for England to use every effort to establish and maintain the defence of her
flank in Europe. In accordance with this policy she reduced Spain and the Netherlands
to the position of inferior naval Powers. Having accomplished this, England
concentrated all her forces against the increasing strength of France, until she brought
about the downfall of Napoleon Bonaparte and therewith destroyed the military
hegemony of France, which was the most dangerous rival that England had to fear.
The change of attitude in British statesmanship towards Germany took place only very
slowly, not only because the German nation did not represent an obvious danger for
England as long as it lacked national unification, but also because public opinion in
England, which had been directed to other quarters by a system of propaganda that had
been carried out for a long time, could be turned to a new direction only by slow 
degrees.

In order to reach the proposed ends the calmly reflecting statesman had to bow
to popular sentiment, which is the most powerful motive-force and is at the same time
the most lasting in its energy. When the statesman has attained one of his ends, he must
immediately turn his thoughts to others; but only by degrees and the slow work of
propaganda can the sentiment of the masses be shaped into an instrument for the
attainment of the new aims which their leaders have decided on.
As early as 1870-71 England had decided on the new stand it would take. On certain
occasions minor oscillations in that policy were caused by the growing influence of
America in the commercial markets of the world and also by the increasing political
power of Russia; but, unfortunately, Germany did not take advantage of these and,
therefore, the original tendency of British diplomacy was only reinforced.
England looked upon Germany as a Power which was of world importance
commercially and politically and which, partly because of its enormous industrial
development, assumed such threatening proportions that the two countries already
contended against one another in the same sphere and with equal energy. The so-called
peaceful conquest of the world by commercial enterprise, which, in the eyes of those
who governed our public affairs at that time, represented the highest peak of human
wisdom, was just the thing that led English statesmen to adopt a policy of resistance.
That this resistance assumed the form of an organized aggression on a vast scale was in
full conformity with a type of statesmanship which did not aim at the maintenance of a
dubious world peace but aimed at the consolidation of British world-hegemony. In
carrying out this policy, England allied herself with those countries which had a
definite military importance. And that was in keeping with her traditional caution in
estimating the power of her adversary and also in recognizing her own temporary
weakness. That line of conduct cannot be called unscrupulous; because such a
comprehensive organization for war purposes must not be judged from the heroic point
of view but from that of expediency. The object of a diplomatic policy must not be to see
that a nation goes down heroically but rather that it survives in a practical way. Hence
every road that leads to this goal is opportune and the failure to take it must be looked
upon as a criminal neglect of duty.
When the German Revolution took place England's fears of a German world hegemony
came to a satisfactory end.
From that time it was not an English interest to see Germany totally cancelled from the
geographic map of Europe. On the contrary, the astounding collapse which took place
in November 1918 found British diplomacy confronted with a situation which at first
appeared untenable.

For four-and-a-half years the British Empire had fought to break the presumed
preponderance of a Continental Power. A sudden collapse now happened which 
removed this Power from the foreground of European affairs. That collapse disclosed
itself finally in the lack of even the primordial instinct of self-preservation, so that
European equilibrium was destroyed within forty-eight hours. Germany was
annihilated and France became the first political Power on the Continent of Europe.
The tremendous propaganda which was carried on during this war for the purpose of
encouraging the British public to stick it out to the end aroused all the primitive
instincts and passions of the populace and was bound eventually to hang as a leaden
weight on the decisions of British statesmen. With the colonial, economical and
commercial destruction of Germany, England's war aims were attained. Whatever went
beyond those aims was an obstacle to the furtherance of British interests. Only the
enemies of England could profit by the disappearance of Germany as a Great
Continental Power in Europe. In November 1918, however, and up to the summer of
1919, it was not possible for England to change its diplomatic attitude; because during
the long war it had appealed, more than it had ever done before, to the feelings of the
populace. In view of the feeling prevalent among its own people, England could not
change its foreign policy; and another reason which made that impossible was the
military strength to which other European Powers had now attained. France had taken
the direction of peace negotiations into her own hands and could impose her law upon
the others. During those months of negotiations and bargaining the only Power that
could have altered the course which things were taking was Germany herself; but
Germany was torn asunder by a civil war, and her so-called statesmen had declared
themselves ready to accept any and every dictate imposed on them.
Now, in the comity of nations, when one nation loses its instinct for self-preservation
and ceases to be an active member it sinks to the level of an enslaved nation and its
territory will have to suffer the fate of a colony.
To prevent the power of France from becoming too great, the only form which English
negotiations could take was that of participating in France's lust for aggrandizement.
As a matter of fact, England did not attain the ends for which she went to war. Not only
did it turn out impossible to prevent a Continental Power from obtaining a
preponderance over the ratio of strength in the Continental State system of Europe, but
a large measure of preponderance had been obtained and firmly established.
In 1914 Germany, considered as a military State, was wedged in between two countries,
one of which had equal military forces at its disposal and the other had greater military
resources. Then there was England's overwhelming supremacy at sea. France and
Russia alone hindered and opposed the excessive aggrandizement of Germany. The
unfavourable geographical situation of the REICH, from the military point of view,
might be looked upon as another coefficient of security against an exaggerated increase
of German power. From the naval point of view, the configuration of the coast-line was 
unfavourable in case of a conflict with England. And though the maritime frontier was
short and cramped, the land frontier was widely extended and open.
France's position is different to-day. It is the first military Power without a serious rival
on the Continent. It is almost entirely protected by its southern frontier against Spain
and Italy. Against Germany it is safeguarded by the prostrate condition of our country.
A long stretch of its coast-line faces the vital nervous system of the British Empire. Not
only could French aeroplanes and long-range batteries attack the vital centres of the
British system, but submarines can threaten the great British commercial routes. A
submarine campaign based on France's long Atlantic coast and on the European and
North African coasts of the Mediterranean would have disastrous consequences for
England.

Thus the political results of the war to prevent the development of German power was
the creation of a French hegemony on the Continent. The military result was the
consolidation of France as the first Continental Power and the recognition of American
equality on the sea. The economic result was the cession of great spheres of British
interests to her former allies and associates.
The Balkanization of Europe, up to a certain degree, was desirable and indeed
necessary in the light of the traditional policy of Great Britain, just as France desired the
Balkanization of Germany.
What England has always desired, and will continue to desire, is to prevent any one
Continental Power in Europe from attaining a position of world importance. Therefore
England wishes to maintain a definite equilibrium of forces among the European States-
-for this equilibrium seems a necessary condition of England's world-hegemony.
What France has always desired, and will continue to desire, is to prevent Germany
from becoming a homogeneous Power. Therefore France wants to maintain a system of
small German States whose forces would balance one another and over which there
should be no central government. Then, by acquiring possession of the left bank of the
Rhine, she would have fulfilled the pre-requisite conditions for the establishment and
security of her hegemony in Europe.
The final aims of French diplomacy must be in perpetual opposition to the final
tendencies of British statesmanship.

Taking these considerations as a starting-point, anyone who investigates the
possibilities that exist for Germany to find allies must come to the conclusion that there
remains no other way of forming an alliance except to approach England. The
consequences of England's war policy were and are disastrous for Germany. However,
we cannot close our eyes to the fact that, as things stand to-day, the necessary interests 
of England no longer demand the destruction of Germany. On the contrary, British
diplomacy must tend more and more, from year to year, towards curbing France's
unbridled lust after hegemony. Now, a policy of alliances cannot be pursued by bearing
past grievances in mind, but it can be rendered fruitful by taking account of past
experiences. Experience should have taught us that alliances formed for negative
purposes suffer from intrinsic weakness. The destinies of nations can be welded
together only under the prospect of a common success, of common gain and conquest,
in short, a common extension of power for both contracting parties.
The ignorance of our people on questions of foreign politics is clearly demonstrated by
the reports in the daily Press which talk about "friendship towards Germany" on the
part of one or the other foreign statesman, whereby this professed friendship is taken as
a special guarantee that such persons will champion a policy that will be advantageous
to our people. That kind of talk is absurd to an incredible degree. It means speculating
on the unparalleled simplicity of the average German philistine when he comes to
talking politics. There is not any British, American, or Italian statesman who could ever
be described as 'pro-German'. Every Englishman must naturally be British first of all.
The same is true of every American. And no Italian statesman would be prepared to
adopt a policy that was not pro-Italian. Therefore, anyone who expects to form alliances
with foreign nations on the basis of a pro-German feeling among the statesmen of other
countries is either an ass or a deceiver. The necessary condition for linking together the
destinies of nations is never mutual esteem or mutual sympathy, but rather the prospect
of advantages accruing to the contracting parties. It is true that a British statesman will
always follow a pro-British and not a pro-German policy; but it is also true that certain
definite interests involved in this pro-British policy may coincide on various grounds
with German interests. Naturally that can be so only to a certain degree and the
situation may one day be completely reversed. But the art of statesmanship is shown
when at certain periods there is question of reaching a certain end and when allies are
found who must take the same road in order to defend their own interests.
The practical application of these principles at the present time must depend on the
answer given to the following questions: What States are not vitally interested in the
fact that, by the complete abolition of a German Central Europe, the economic and
military power of France has reached a position of absolute hegemony? Which are the
States that, in consideration of the conditions which are essential to their own existence
and in view of the tradition that has hitherto been followed in conducting their foreign
policy, envisage such a development as a menace to their own future?
Finally, we must be quite clear on the following point: France is and will remain the
implacable enemy of Germany. It does not matter what Governments have ruled or will
rule in France, whether Bourbon or Jacobin, Napoleonic or Bourgeois-Democratic,
Clerical Republican or Red Bolshevik, their foreign policy will always be directed 
towards acquiring possession of the Rhine frontier and consolidating France's position
on this river by disuniting and dismembering Germany.
England did not want Germany to be a world Power. France desired that there should
be no Power called Germany. Therefore there was a very essential difference. To-day
we are not fighting for our position as a World-Power but only for the existence of our
country, for national unity and the daily bread of our children. Taking this point of
view into consideration, only two States remain to us as possible allies in Europe--
England and Italy.

England is not pleased to see a France on whose military power there is no check in
Europe, so that one day she might undertake the support of a policy which in some way
or other might come into conflict with British interests. Nor can England be pleased to
see France in possession of such enormous coal and iron mines in Western Europe as
would make it possible for her one day to play a role in world-commerce which might
threaten danger to British interests. Moreover, England can never be pleased to see a
France whose political position on the Continent, owing to the dismemberment of the
rest of Europe, seems so absolutely assured that she is not only able to resume a French
world-policy on great lines but would even find herself compelled to do so. The bombs
which were once dropped by the Zeppelins might be multiplied by the thousand every
night. The military predominance of France is a weight that presses heavily on the
hearts of the World Empire over which Great Britain rules.
Nor can Italy desire, nor will she desire, any further strengthening of France's power in
Europe. The future of Italy will be conditioned by the development of events in the
Mediterranean and by the political situation in the area surrounding that sea. The
reason that led Italy into the War was not a desire to contribute towards the
aggrandizement of France but rather to deal her hated Adriatic rival a mortal blow. Any
further increase of France's power on the Continent would hamper the development of
Italy's future, and Italy does not deceive herself by thinking that racial kindred between
the nations will in any way eliminate rivalries.
Serious and impartial consideration proves that it is these two States, Great Britain and
Italy, whose natural interests not only do not contrast with the conditions essential to
the existence of the German nation but are identical with them, to a certain extent.
But when we consider the possibilities of alliances we must be careful not to lose sight
of three factors. The first factor concerns ourselves; the other two concern the two States
I have mentioned.

Is it at all possible to conclude an alliance with Germany as it is to-day? Can a Power
which would enter into an alliance for the purpose of securing assistance in an effort to
carry out its own OFFENSIVE aims--can such a Power form an alliance with a State 
whose rulers have for years long presented a spectacle of deplorable incompetence and
pacifist cowardice and where the majority of the people, blinded by democratic and
Marxist teachings, betray the interests of their own people and country in a manner that
cries to Heaven for vengeance? As things stand to-day, can any Power hope to establish
useful relations and hope to fight together for the furtherance of their common interests
with this State which manifestly has neither the will nor the courage to move a finger
even in the defence of its bare existence? Take the case of a Power for which an alliance
must be much more than a pact to guarantee a state of slow decomposition, such as
happened with the old and disastrous Triple Alliance. Can such a Power associate itself
for life or death with a State whose most characteristic signs of activity consist of a
rampant servility in external relations and a scandalous repression of the national spirit
at home? Can such a Power be associated with a State in which there is nothing of
greatness, because its whole policy does not deserve it? Or can alliances be made with
Governments which are in the hands of men who are despised by their own fellowcitizens and consequently are not respected abroad?

No. A self-respecting Power which expects something more from alliances than
commissions for greedy Parliamentarians will not and cannot enter into an alliance with
our present-day Germany. Our present inability to form alliances furnishes the
principle and most solid basis for the combined action of the enemies who are robbing
us. Because Germany does not defend itself in any other way except by the flamboyant
protests of our parliamentarian elect, there is no reason why the rest of the world
should take up the fight in our defence. And God does not follow the principle of
granting freedom to a nation of cowards, despite all the implications of our 'patriotic'
associations. Therefore, for those States which have not a direct interest in our
annihilation no other course remains open except to participate in France's campaign of
plunder, at least to make it impossible for the strength of France to be exclusively
aggrandized thereby.

In the second place, we must not forget that among the nations which were formerly
our enemies mass-propaganda has turned the opinions and feelings of large sections of
the population in a fixed direction. When for years long a foreign nation has been
presented to the public as a horde of 'Huns', 'Robbers', 'Vandals', etc., they cannot
suddenly be presented as something different, and the enemy of yesterday cannot be
recommended as the ally of tomorrow.
But the third factor deserves greater attention, since it is of essential importance for
establishing future alliances in Europe.

From the political point of view it is not in the interests of Great Britain that Germany
should be ruined even still more, but such a proceeding would be very much in the
interests of the international money-markets manipulated by the Jew. The cleavage
between the official, or rather traditional, British statesmanship and the controlling 
influence of the Jew on the money-markets is nowhere so clearly manifested as in the
various attitudes taken towards problems of British foreign policy. Contrary to the
interests and welfare of the British State, Jewish finance demands not only the absolute
economic destruction of Germany but its complete political enslavement. The
internationalization of our German economic system, that is to say, the transference of
our productive forces to the control of Jewish international finance, can be completely
carried out only in a State that has been politically Bolshevized. But the Marxist fighting
forces, commanded by international and Jewish stock-exchange capital, cannot finally
smash the national resistance in Germany without friendly help from outside. For this
purpose French armies would first have to invade and overcome the territory of the
German REICH until a state of international chaos would set in, and then the country
would have to succumb to Bolshevik storm troops in the service of Jewish international
finance.

Hence it is that at the present time the Jew is the great agitator for the complete
destruction of Germany. Whenever we read of attacks against Germany taking place in
any part of the world the Jew is always the instigator. In peace-time, as well as during
the War, the Jewish-Marxist stock-exchange Press systematically stirred up hatred
against Germany, until one State after another abandoned its neutrality and placed
itself at the service of the world coalition, even against the real interests of its own
people.

The Jewish way of reasoning thus becomes quite clear. The Bolshevization of Germany,
that is to say, the extermination of the patriotic and national German intellectuals, thus
making it possible to force German Labour to bear the yoke of international Jewish
finance--that is only the overture to the movement for expanding Jewish power on a
wider scale and finally subjugating the world to its rule. As has so often happened in
history, Germany is the chief pivot of this formidable struggle. If our people and our
State should fall victims to these oppressors of the nations, lusting after blood and
money, the whole earth would become the prey of that hydra. Should Germany be
freed from its grip, a great menace for the nations of the world would thereby be
eliminated.

It is certain that Jewry uses all its subterranean activities not only for the purpose of
keeping alive old national enmities against Germany but even to spread them farther
and render them more acute wherever possible. It is no less certain that these activities
are only very partially in keeping with the true interests of the nations among whose
people the poison is spread. As a general principle, Jewry carries on its campaign in the
various countries by the use of arguments that are best calculated to appeal to the
mentality of the respective nations and are most likely to produce the desired results;
for Jewry knows what the public feeling is in each country. Our national stock has been
so much adulterated by the mixture of alien elements that, in its fight for power, Jewry
can make use of the more or less 'cosmopolitan' circles which exist among us, inspired 
by the pacifist and international ideologies. In France they exploit the well-known and
accurately estimated chauvinistic spirit. In England they exploit the commercial and
world-political outlook. In short, they always work upon the essential characteristics
that belong to the mentality of each nation. When they have in this way achieved a
decisive influence in the political and economic spheres they can drop the limitations
which their former tactics necessitated, now disclosing their real intentions and the ends
for which they are fighting. Their work of destruction now goes ahead more quickly,
reducing one State after another to a mass of ruins on which they will erect the
everlasting and sovereign Jewish Empire.

In England, and in Italy, the contrast between the better kind of solid statesmanship and
the policy of the Jewish stock-exchange often becomes strikingly evident.
Only in France there exists to-day more than ever before a profound accord between the
views of the stock-exchange, controlled by the Jews, and the chauvinistic policy
pursued by French statesmen. This identity of views constitutes an immense, danger for
Germany. And it is just for this reason that France is and will remain by far the most
dangerous enemy. The French people, who are becoming more and more obsessed by
negroid ideas, represent a threatening menace to the existence of the white race in
Europe, because they are bound up with the Jewish campaign for world-domination.
For the contamination caused by the influx of negroid blood on the Rhine, in the very
heart of Europe, is in accord with the sadist and perverse lust for vengeance on the part
of the hereditary enemy of our people, just as it suits the purpose of the cool calculating
Jew who would use this means of introducing a process of bastardization in the very
centre of the European Continent and, by infecting the white race with the blood of an
inferior stock, would destroy the foundations of its independent existence.
France's activities in Europe to-day, spurred on by the French lust for vengeance and
systematically directed by the Jew, are a criminal attack against the life of the white race
and will one day arouse against the French people a spirit of vengeance among a
generation which will have recognized the original sin of mankind in this racial
pollution.
As far as concerns Germany, the danger which France represents involves the duty of
relegating all sentiment to a subordinate place and extending the hand to those who are
threatened with the same menace and who are not willing to suffer or tolerate France's
lust for hegemony.
For a long time yet to come there will be only two Powers in Europe with which it may
be possible for Germany to conclude an alliance. These Powers are Great Britain and
Italy. 

If we take the trouble to cast a glance backwards on the way in which German foreign
policy has been conducted since the Revolution we must, in view of the constant and
incomprehensible acts of submission on the part. of our governments, either lose heart
or become fired with rage and take up the cudgels against such a regime. Their way of
acting cannot be attributed to a want of understanding, because what seemed to every
thinking man to be inconceivable was accomplished by the leaders of the November
parties with their Cyclopean intellects. They bowed to France and begged her favour.
Yes, during all these recent years, with the touching simplicity of incorrigible
visionaries, they went on their knees to France again and again. They perpetuaily
wagged their tails before the GRANDE NATION. And in each trick-o'-the-loop which
the French hangmen performed with his rope they recognized a visible change of
feeling. Our real political wire-pullers never shared in this absurd credulity. The idea of
establishing a friendship with France was for them only a means of thwarting every
attempt on Germany's part to adopt a practical policy of alliances. They had no illusions
about French aims or those of the men behind the scenes in France. What induced them
to take up such an attitude and to act as if they honestly believed that the fate of
Germany could possibly be changed in this way was the cool calculation that if this did
not happen our people might take the reins into their own hands and choose another
road.

Of course it is difficult for us to propose England as our possible ally in the future. Our
Jewish Press has always been adept in concentrating hatred against England
particularly. And many of our good German simpletons perch on these branches which
the Jews have limed to capture them. They babble about a restoration of German sea
power and protest against the robbery of our colonies. Thus they furnish material which
the contriving Jew transmits to his clansmen in England, so that it can be used there for
purposes of practical propaganda. For our simple-minded bourgeoisie who indulge in
politics can take in only little by little the idea that to-day we have not to fight for 'seapower' and such things. Even before the War it was absurd to direct the national
energies of Germany towards this end without first having secured our position in
Europe. Such a hope to-day reaches that peak of absurdity which may be called
criminal in the domain of politics.

Often one becomes really desperate on seeing how the Jewish wire-pullers succeeded in
concentrating the attention of the people on things which are only of secondary
importance to-day, They incited the people to demonstrations and protests while at the
same time France was tearing our nation asunder bit by bit and systematically
removing the very foundations of our national independence.
In this connection I have to think of the Wooden Horse in the riding of which the Jew
showed extraordinary skill during these years. I mean South Tyrol. 
Yes, South Tyrol. The reason why I take up this question here is just because I want to
call to account that shameful CANAILLE who relied on the ignorance and short
memories of large sections of our people and stimulated a national indignation which is
as foreign to the real character of our parliamentary impostors as the idea of respect for
private property is to a magpie.

I should like to state here that I was one of those who, at the time when the fate of South
Tyrol was being decided--that is to say, from August 1914 to November 1918--took my
place where that country also could have been effectively defended, namely, in the
Army. I did my share in the fighting during those years, not merely to save South Tyrol
from being lost but also to save every other German province for the Fatherland.
The parliamentary sharpers did not take part in that combat. The whole CANAILLE
played party politics. On the other hand, we carried on the fight in the belief that a
victorious issue of the War would enable the German nation to keep South Tyrol also;
but the loud-mouthed traitor carried on a seditious agitation against such a victorious
issue, until the fighting Siegfried succumbed to the dagger plunged in his back. It was
only natural that the inflammatory and hypocritical speeches of the elegantly dressed
parliamentarians on the Vienna RATHAUS PLATZ or in front of the
FELDHERRNHALLE in Munich could not save South Tyrol for Germany. That could
be done only by the fighting battalions at the Front. Those who broke up that fighting
front betrayed South Tyrol, as well as the other districts of Germany.
Anyone who thinks that the South Tyrol question can be solved to-day by protests and
manifestations and processions organized by various associations is either a humbug or
merely a German philistine.

In this regard it must be quite clearly understood that we cannot get back the territories
we have lost if we depend on solemn imprecations before the throne of the Almighty
God or on pious hopes in a League of Nations, but only by the force of arms.
Therefore the only remaining question is: Who is ready to take up arms for the
restoration of the lost territories?
As far as concerns myself personally, I can state with a good conscience that I would
have courage enough to take part in a campaign for the reconquest of South Tyrol, at
the head of parliamentarian storm battalions consisting of parliamentarian gasconaders
and all the party leaders, also the various Councillors of State. Only the Devil knows
whether I might have the luck of seeing a few shells suddenly burst over this 'burning'
demonstration of protest. I think that if a fox were to break into a poultry yard his
presence would not provoke such a helter-skelter and rush to cover as we should
witness in the band of 'protesters'. 

The vilest part of it all is that these talkers themselves do not believe that anything can
be achieved in this way. Each one of them knows very well how harmless and
ineffective their whole pretence is. They do it only because it is easier now to babble
about the restoration of South Tyrol than to fight for its preservation in days gone by.
Each one plays the part that he is best capable of playing in life. In those days we
offered our blood. To-day these people are engaged in whetting their tusks.
It is particularly interesting to note to-day how legitimist circles in Vienna preen
themselves on their work for the restoration of South Tyrol. Seven years ago their
august and illustrious Dynasty helped, by an act of perjury and treason, to make it
possible for the victorious world-coalition to take away South Tyrol. At that time these
circles supported the perfidious policy adopted by their Dynasty and did not trouble
themselves in the least about the fate of South Tyrol or any other province. Naturally it
is easier to-day to take up the fight for this territory, since the present struggle is waged
with 'the weapons of the mind'. Anyhow, it is easier to join in a 'meeting of protestation'
and talk yourself hoarse in giving vent to the noble indignation that fills your breast, or
stain your finger with the writing of a newspaper article, than to blow up a bridge, for
instance, during the occupation of the Ruhr.
The reason why certain circles have made the question of South Tyrol the pivot of
German-Italian relations during the past few years is quite evident. Jews and Habsburg
legitimists are greatly interested in preventing Germany from pursuing a policy of
alliance which might lead one day to the resurgence of a free German fatherland. It is
not out of love for South Tyrol that they play this role to-day--for their policy would
turn out detrimental rather than helpful to the interests of that province--but through
fear of an agreement being established between Germany and Italy.
A tendency towards lying and calumny lies in the nature of these people, and that
explains how they can calmly and brazenly attempt to twist things in such a way as to
make it appear that we have 'betrayed' South Tyrol.
There is one clear answer that must be given to these gentlemen. It is this: Tyrol has
been betrayed, in the first place, by every German who was sound in limb and body
and did not offer himself for service at the Front during 1914-1918 to do his duty
towards his country.

In the second place, Tyrol was betrayed by every man who, during those years did not
help to reinforce the national spirit and the national powers of resistance, so as to enable
the country to carry through the War and keep up the fight to the very end. 
In the third place, South Tyrol was betrayed by everyone who took part in the
November Revolution, either directly by his act or indirectly by a cowardly toleration of
it, and thus broke the sole weapon that could have saved South Tyrol.
In the fourth place, South Tyrol was betrayed by those parties and their adherents who
put their signatures to the disgraceful treaties of Versailles and St. Germain.
And so the matter stands, my brave gentlemen, who make your protests only with
words.

To-day I am guided by a calm and cool recognition of the fact that the lost territories
cannot be won back by the whetted tongues of parliamentary spouters but only by the
whetted sword; in other words, through a fight where blood will have to be shed.
Now, I have no hesitations in saying that to-day, once the die has been cast, it is not
only impossible to win back South Tyrol through a war but I should definitely take my
stand against such a movement, because I am convinced that it would not be possible to
arouse the national enthusiasm of the German people and maintain it in such a way as
would be necessary in order to carry through such a war to a successful issue. On the
contrary, I believe that if we have to shed German blood once again it would be
criminal to do so for the sake of liberating 200,000 Germans, when more than seven
million neighbouring Germans are suffering under foreign domination and a vital
artery of the German nation has become a playground for hordes of African niggers.
If the German nation is to put an end to a state of things which threatens to wipe it off
the map of Europe it must not fall into the errors of the pre-War period and make the
whole world its enemy. But it must ascertain who is its most dangerous enemy so that it
can concentrate all its forces in a struggle to beat him. And if, in order to carry through
this struggle to victory, sacrifices should be made in other quarters, future generations
will not condemn us for that. They will take account of the miseries and anxieties which
led us to make such a bitter decision, and in the light of that consideration they will
more clearly recognize the brilliancy of our success.
Again I must say here that we must always be guided by the fundamental principle
that, as a preliminary to winning back lost provinces, the political independence and
strength of the motherland must first be restored.
The first task which has to be accomplished is to make that independence possible and
to secure it by a wise policy of alliances, which presupposes an energetic management
of our public affairs.

But it is just on this point that we, National Socialists, have to guard against being
dragged into the tow of our ranting bourgeois patriots who take their cue from the Jew. 
It would be a disaster if, instead of preparing for the coming struggle, our Movement
also were to busy itself with mere protests by word of mouth.
It was the fantastic idea of a Nibelungen alliance with the decomposed body of the
Habsburg State that brought about Germany's ruin. Fantastic sentimentality in dealing
with the possibilities of foreign policy to-day would be the best means of preventing
our revival for innumerable years to come.
Here I must briefly answer the objections which may be raised in regard to the three
questions I have put.
1. Is it possible at all to form an alliance with the present Germany, whose weakness is
so visible to all eyes?
2. Can the ex-enemy nations change their attitude towards Germany?
3. In other nations is not the influence of Jewry stronger than the recognition of their
own interests, and does not this influence thwart all their good intentions and render all
their plans futile?

I think that I have already dealt adequately with one of the two aspects of the first
point. Of course nobody will enter into an alliance with the present Germany. No
Power in the world would link its fortunes with a State whose government does not
afford grounds for the slightest confidence. As regards the attempt which has been
made by many of our compatriots to explain the conduct of the Government by
referring to the woeful state of public feeling and thus excuse such conduct, I must
strongly object to that way of looking at things.

The lack of character which our people have shown during the last six years is deeply
distressing. The indifference with which they have treated the most urgent necessities
of our nation might veritably lead one to despair. Their cowardice is such that it often
cries to heaven for vengeance. But one must never forget that we are dealing with a
people who gave to the world, a few years previously, an admirable example of the
highest human qualities. From the first days of August 1914 to the end of the
tremendous struggle between the nations, no people in the world gave a better proof of
manly courage, tenacity and patient endurance, than this people gave who are so cast
down and dispirited to-day. Nobody will dare to assert that the lack of character among
our people to-day is typical of them. What we have to endure to-day, among us and
around us, is due only to the influence of the sad and distressing effects that followed
the high treason committed on November 9th, 1918. More than ever before the word of
the poet is true: that evil can only give rise to evil. But even in this epoch those qualities
among our people which are fundamentally sound are not entirely lost. They slumber
in the depths of the national conscience, and sometimes in the clouded firmament we 
see certain qualities like shining lights which Germany will one day remember as the
first symptoms of a revival. We often see young Germans assembling and forming
determined resolutions, as they did in 1914, freely and willingly to offer themselves as a
sacrifice on the altar of their beloved Fatherland. Millions of men have resumed work,
whole-heartedly and zealously, as if no revolution had ever affected them. The smith is
at his anvil once again. And the farmer drives his plough. The scientist is in his
laboratory. And everybody is once again attending to his duty with the same zeal and
devotion as formerly.

The oppression which we suffer from at the hands of our enemies is no longer taken, as
it formerly was, as a matter for laughter; but it is resented with bitterness and anger.
There can be no doubt that a great change of attitude has taken place.
This evolution has not yet taken the shape of a conscious intention and movement to
restore the political power and independence of our nation; but the blame for this must
be attributed to those utterly incompetent people who have no natural endowments to
qualify them for statesmanship and yet have been governing our nation since 1918 and
leading it to ruin.

Yes. If anybody accuses our people to-day he ought to be asked: What is being done to
help them? What are we to say of the poor support which the people give to any
measures introduced by the Government? Is it not true that such a thing as a
Government hardly exists at all? And must we consider the poor support which it
receives as a sign of a lack of vitality in the nation itself; or is it not rather a proof of the
complete failure of the methods employed in the management of this valuable trust?
What have our Governments done to re-awaken in the nation a proud spirit of selfassertion, up-standing manliness, and a spirit of righteous defiance towards its
enemies?

In 1919, when the Peace Treaty was imposed on the German nation, there were grounds
for hoping that this instrument of unrestricted oppression would help to reinforce the
outcry for the freedom of Germany. Peace treaties which make demands that fall like a
whip-lash on the people turn out not infrequently to be the signal of a future revival.
To what purpose could the Treaty of Versailles have been exploited?
In the hands of a willing Government, how could this instrument of unlimited
blackmail and shameful humiliation have been applied for the purpose of arousing
national sentiment to its highest pitch? How could a well-directed system of
propaganda have utilized the sadist cruelty of that treaty so as to change the
indifference of the people to a feeling of indignation and transform that indignation into
a spirit of dauntless resistance? 
Each point of that Treaty could have been engraved on the minds and hearts of the
German people and burned into them until sixty million men and women would find
their souls aflame with a feeling of rage and shame; and a torrent of fire would burst
forth as from a furnace, and one common will would be forged from it, like a sword of
steel. Then the people would join in the common cry: "To arms again!"
Yes. A treaty of that kind can be used for such a purpose. Its unbounded oppression
and its impudent demands were an excellent propaganda weapon to arouse the
sluggish spirit of the nation and restore its vitality.
Then, from the child's story-book to the last newspaper in the country, and every
theatre and cinema, every pillar where placards are posted and every free space on the
hoardings should be utilized in the service of this one great mission, until the fainthearted cry, "Lord, deliver us," which our patriotic associations send up to Heaven today would be transformed into an ardent prayer: "Almighty God, bless our arms when the hour comes. Be just, as Thou hast always been just. Judge now if we deserve our
freedom. Lord, bless our struggle."

All opportunities were neglected and nothing was done.
Who will be surprised now if our people are not such as they should be or might be?
The rest of the world looks upon us only as its valet, or as a kindly dog that will lick its
master's hand after he has been whipped.
Of course the possibilities of forming alliances with other nations are hampered by the
indifference of our own people, but much more by our Governments. They have been
and are so corrupt that now, after eight years of indescribable oppression, there exists
only a faint desire for liberty.
In order that our nation may undertake a policy of alliances, it must restore its prestige
among other nations, and it must have an authoritative Government that is not a
drudge in the service of foreign States and the taskmaster of its own people, but rather
the herald of the national will.

If our people had a government which would look upon this as its mission, six years
would not have passed before a courageous foreign policy on the part of the REICH
would find a corresponding support among the people, whose desire for freedom
would be encouraged and intensified thereby.
The third objection referred to the difficulty of changing the ex-enemy nations into
friendly allies. That objection may be answered as follows: 
The general anti-German psychosis which has developed in other countries through the
war propaganda must of necessity continue to exist as long as there is not a renaissance
of the national conscience among the German people, so that the German REICH may
once again become a State which is able to play its part on the chess-board of European
politics and with whom the others feel that they can play. Only when the Government
and the people feel absolutely certain of being able to undertake a policy of alliances can
one Power or another, whose interests coincide with ours, think of instituting a system
of propaganda for the purpose of changing public opinion among its own people.
Naturally it will take several years of persevering and ably directed work to reach such
a result. Just because a long period is needed in order to change the public opinion of a
country, it is necessary to reflect calmly before such an enterprise be undertaken. This
means that one must not enter upon this kind of work unless one is absolutely
convinced that it is worth the trouble and that it will bring results which will be
valuable in the future. One must not try to change the opinions and feelings of a people
by basing one's actions on the vain cajolery of a more or less brilliant Foreign Minister,
but only if there be a tangible guarantee that the new orientation will be really useful.
Otherwise public opinion in the country dealt with may be just thrown into a state of
complete confusion. The most reliable guarantee that can be given for the possibility of
subsequently entering into an alliance with a certain State cannot be found in the
loquacious suavity of some individual member of the Government, but in the manifest
stability of a definite and practical policy on the part of the Government as a whole, and
in the support which is given to that policy by the public opinion of the country. The
faith of the public in this policy will be strengthened all the more if the Government
organize one active propaganda to explain its efforts and secure public support for
them, and if public opinion favourably responds to the Government's policy.
Therefore a nation in such a position as ours will be looked upon as a possible ally if
public opinion supports the Government's policy and if both are united in the same
enthusiastic determination to carry through the fight for national freedom. That
condition of affairs must be firmly established before any attempt can be made to
change public opinion in other countries which, for the sake of defending their most
elementary interests, are disposed to take the road shoulder-to-shoulder with a
companion who seems able to play his part in defending those interests. In other words,
this means that they will be ready to establish an alliance.
For this purpose, however, one thing is necessary. Seeing that the task of bringing about
a radical change in the public opinion of a country calls for hard work, and many do not
at first understand what it means, it would be both foolish and criminal to commit
mistakes which could be used as weapons in the hands of those who are opposed to
such a change.

One must recognize the fact that it takes a long time for a people to understand
completely the inner purposes which a Government has in view, because it is not 
possible to explain the ultimate aims of the preparations that are being made to carry
through a certain policy. In such cases the Government has to count on the blind faith of
the masses or the intuitive instinct of the ruling caste that is more developed
intellectually. But since many people lack this insight, this political acumen and faculty
for seeing into the trend of affairs, and since political considerations forbid a public
explanation of why such and such a course is being followed, a certain number of
leaders in intellectual circles will always oppose new tendencies which, because they
are not easily grasped, can be pointed to as mere experiments. And that attitude arouses
opposition among conservative circles regarding the measures in question.
For this reason a strict duty devolves upon everybody not to allow any weapon to fall
into the hands of those who would interfere with the work of bringing about a mutual
understanding with other nations. This is specially so in our case, where we have to
deal with the pretentions and fantastic talk of our patriotic associations and our small
bourgeoisie who talk politics in the cafes. That the cry for a new war fleet, the
restoration of our colonies, etc., has no chance of ever being carried out in practice will
not be denied by anyone who thinks over the matter calmly and seriously. These
harmless and sometimes half-crazy spouters in the war of protests are serving the
interests of our mortal enemy, while the manner in which their vapourings are
exploited for political purposes in England cannot be considered as advantageous to
Germany.

They squander their energies in futile demonstrations against the whole world. These
demonstrations are harmful to our interests and those who indulge in them forget the
fundamental principle which is a preliminary condition of all success. What thou doest,
do it thoroughly. Because we keep on howling against five or ten States we fail to
concentrate all the forces of our national will and our physical strength for a blow at the
heart of our bitterest enemy. And in this way we sacrifice the possibility of securing an
alliance which would reinforce our strength for that decisive conflict.
Here, too, there is a mission for National Socialism to fulfil. It must teach our people not
to fix their attention on the little things but rather on the great things, not to exhaust
their energies on secondary objects, and not to forget that the object we shall have to
fight for one day is the bare existence of our people and that the sole enemy we shall
have to strike at is that Power which is robbing us of this existence.
It may be that we shall have many a heavy burden to bear. But this is by no means an
excuse for refusing to listen to reason and raise nonsensical outcries against the rest of
the world, instead of concentrating all our forces against the most deadly enemy.
Moreover, the German people will have no moral right to complain of the manner in
which the rest of the world acts towards them, as long as they themselves have not
called to account those criminals who sold and betrayed their own country. We cannot 
hope to be taken very seriously if we indulge in long-range abuse and protests against
England and Italy and then allow those scoundrels to circulate undisturbed in our own
country who were in the pay of the enemy war propaganda, took the weapons out of
our hands, broke the backbone of our resistance and bartered away the REICH for
thirty pieces of silver.
The enemy did only what was expected. And we ought to learn from the stand he took
and the way he acted.

Anyone who cannot rise to the level of this outlook must reflect that otherwise there
would remain nothing else than to renounce the idea of adopting any policy of alliances
for the future. For if we cannot form an alliance with England because she has robbed
us of our colonies, or with Italy because she has taken possession of South Tyrol, or
with Poland or Czechoslovakia, then there remains no other possibility of an alliance in
Europe except with France which, inter alia, has robbed us of Alsace and Lorraine.
There can scarcely be any doubt as to whether this last alternative would be
advantageous to the interests of the German people. But if it be defended by somebody
one is always doubtful whether that person be merely a simpleton or an astute rogue.
As far as concerns the leaders in these activities, I think the latter hypothesis is true.
A change in public feeling among those nations which have hitherto been enemies and
whose true interests will correspond in the future with ours could be effected, as far as
human calculation goes, if the internal strength of our State and our manifest
determination to secure our own existence made it clear that we should be valuable
allies. Moreover, it is necessary that our incompetent way of doing things and our
criminal conduct in some matters should not furnish grounds which may be utilized for
purposes of propaganda by those who would oppose our projects of establishing an
alliance with one or other of our former enemies.

The answer to the third question is still more difficult: Is it conceivable that they who
represent the true interests of those nations which may possibly form an alliance with
us could put their views into practice against the will of the Jew, who is the mortal
enemy of national and independent popular States?

For instance, could the motive-forces of Great Britain's traditional statesmanship smash
the disastrous influence of the Jew, or could they not?
This question, as I have already said, is very difficult to answer. The answer depends on
so many factors that it is impossible to form a conclusive judgment. Anyhow, one thing
is certain: The power of the Government in a given State and at a definite period may be
so firmly established in the public estimation and so absolutely at the service of the 
country's interests that the forces of international Jewry could not possibly organize a
real and effective obstruction against measures considered to be politically necessary.
The fight which Fascist Italy waged against Jewry's three principal weapons, the
profound reasons for which may not have been consciously understood (though I do
not believe this myself) furnishes the best proof that the poison fangs of that Power
which transcends all State boundaries are being drawn, even though in an indirect way.
The prohibition of Freemasonry and secret societies, the suppression of the
supernational Press and the definite abolition of Marxism, together with the steadily
increasing consolidation of the Fascist concept of the State--all this will enable the
Italian Government, in the course of some years, to advance more and more the
interests of the Italian people without paying any attention to the hissing of the Jewish
world-hydra.

The English situation is not so favourable. In that country which has 'the freest
democracy' the Jew dictates his will, almost unrestrained but indirectly, through his
influence on public opinion. And yet there is a perpetual struggle in England between
those who are entrusted with the defence of State interests and the protagonists of
Jewish world-dictatorship.
After the War it became clear for the first time how sharp this contrast is, when British
statesmanship took one stand on the Japanese problem and the Press took a different
stand.
Just after the War had ceased the old mutual antipathy between America and Japan
began to reappear. Naturally the great European Powers could not remain indifferent to
this new war menace. In England, despite the ties of kinship, there was a certain
amount of jealousy and anxiety over the growing importance of the United States in all
spheres of international economics and politics. What was formerly a colonial territory,
the daughter of a great mother, seemed about to become the new mistress of the world.

It is quite understandable that to-day England should re-examine her old alliances and that British statesmanship should look anxiously to the danger of a coming moment when the cry would no longer be: "Britain rules the waves", but rather: "The Seas belong to the United States".

The gigantic North American State, with the enormous resources of its virgin soil, is
much more invulnerable than the encircled German REICH. Should a day come when
the die which will finally decide the destinies of the nations will have to be cast in that
country, England would be doomed if she stood alone. Therefore she eagerly reaches
out her hand to a member of the yellow race and enters an alliance which, from the
racial point of view is perhaps unpardonable; but from the political viewpoint it
represents the sole possibility of reinforcing Britain's world position in face of the
strenuous developments taking place on the American continent. 
Despite the fact that they fought side by side on the European battlefields, the British
Government did not decide to conclude an alliance with the Asiatic partner, yet the
whole Jewish Press opposed the idea of a Japanese alliance.
How can we explain the fact that up to 1918 the Jewish Press championed the policy of
the British Government against the German REICH and then suddenly began to take its
own way and showed itself disloyal to the Government?
It was not in the interests of Great Britain to have Germany annihilated, but primarily a
Jewish interest. And to-day the destruction of Japan would serve British political
interests less than it would serve the far-reaching intentions of those who are leading
the movement that hopes to establish a Jewish world-empire. While England is using all
her endeavours to maintain her position in the world, the Jew is organizing his
aggressive plans for the conquest of it.
He already sees the present European States as pliant instruments in his hands, whether
indirectly through the power of so-called Western Democracy or in the form of a direct
domination through Russian Bolshevism. But it is not only the old world that he holds
in his snare; for a like fate threatens the new world. Jews control the financial forces of
America on the stock exchange. Year after year the Jew increases his hold on Labour in
a nation of 120 million souls. But a very small section still remains quite independent
and is thus the cause of chagrin to the Jew.
The Jews show consummate skill in manipulating public opinion and using it as an
instrument in fighting for their own future.
The great leaders of Jewry are confident that the day is near at hand when the
command given in the Old Testament will be carried out and the Jews will devour the
other nations of the earth.

Among this great mass of denationalized countries which have become Jewish colonies
one independent State could bring about the ruin of the whole structure at the last
moment. The reason for doing this would be that Bolshevism as a world-system cannot
continue to exist unless it encompasses the whole earth. Should one State preserve its
national strength and its national greatness the empire of the Jewish satrapy, like every
other tyranny, would have to succumb to the force of the national idea.
As a result of his millennial experience in accommodating himself to surrounding
circumstances, the Jew knows very well that he can undermine the existence of
European nations by a process of racial bastardization, but that he could hardly do the
same to a national Asiatic State like Japan. To-day he can ape the ways of the German
and the Englishman, the American and the Frenchman, but he has no means of 
approach to the yellow Asiatic. Therefore he seeks to destroy the Japanese national State
by using other national States as his instruments, so that he may rid himself of a
dangerous opponent before he takes over supreme control of the last national State and
transforms that control into a tyranny for the oppression of the defenceless.
He does not want to see a national Japanese State in existence when he founds his
millennial empire of the future, and therefore he wants to destroy it before establishing
his own dictatorship.
And so he is busy to-day in stirring up antipathy towards Japan among the other
nations, as he stirred it up against Germany. Thus it may happen that while British
statesmanship is still endeavouring to ground its policy in the alliance with Japan, the
Jewish Press in Great Britain may be at the same time leading a hostile movement
against that ally and preparing for a war of destruction by pretending that it is for the
triumph of democracy and at the same time raising the war-cry: Down with Japanese
militarism and imperialism.
Thus in England to-day the Jew opposes the policy of the State. And for this reason the
struggle against the Jewish world-danger will one day begin also in that country.
And here again the National Socialist Movement has a tremendous task before it.
It must open the eyes of our people in regard to foreign nations and it must continually
remind them of the real enemy who menaces the world to-day. In place of preaching
hatred against Aryans from whom we may be separated on almost every other ground
but with whom the bond of kindred blood and the main features of a common
civilization unite us, we must devote ourselves to arousing general indignation against
the maleficent enemy of humanity and the real author of all our sufferings.
The National Socialist Movement must see to it that at least in our own country the
mortal enemy is recognized and that the fight against him may be a beacon light
pointing to a new and better period for other nations as well as showing the way of
salvation for Aryan humanity in the struggle for its existence.
Finally, may reason be our guide and will-power our strength. And may the sacred
duty of directing our conduct as I have pointed out give us perseverance and tenacity;
and may our faith be our supreme protection.
