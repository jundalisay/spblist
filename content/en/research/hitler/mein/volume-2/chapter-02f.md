In November and December 1918, all the authorities lost their heads.

From the monarch down to the last divisional commander, nobody had sufficient mettle to make a decision on his own responsibility.

That is a flaw of our educational system.

<!-- ; because what was then revealed
on a colossal scale at that moment of catastrophe was only what happens on a smaller
scale everywhere among us.  -->

It is the lack of will-power, and not the lack of arms, which renders us incapable of offering any serious resistance today.

This defect is found everywhere among our people. It prevents decisive action wherever risks have to be taken, as if any great action can be taken without also taking the risk. 

A German General found a formula for this lamentable lack of the will to act: 

{{< q a="General" >}}
I act only when I can count on a 51% probability of success.
{{< /q >}}

In that 51% probability we find the very root of the German collapse. 

The man who demands a guarantee of success from Fate deliberately denies the significance of a heroic act.

This is because a heroic act requires a situation that is fraught with mortal danger.

<!-- , an action is undertaken which may lead to success.  -->

 <!-- and who knows that his death is certain if he does not undergo an operation, needs no 51 per cent probability of a cure before facing the operation.  -->

A cancer patient who can survive only through an operation that promises only 0.5% probability of success will still take it if he is a man of courage.

The cowardly lack of will-power and the incapacity for making decisions are chiefly results of the erroneous education given us in our youth. The disastrous effects of this are now widespread among us. The crowning examples of that tragic chain of consequences are shown in the lack of civil courage which our leading statesmen display.

The cowardice which leads nowadays to the shirking of every kind of responsibility springs from the same roots. Here again it is the fault of the education given our young people. 

This drawback permeates all sections of public life and finds its immortal consummation in the institutions of government that function under the parliamentary regime.

Already in the school, unfortunately, more value is placed on 'confession and full repentance' and 'contrite renouncement', on the part of little sinners, than on a simple and frank avowal. 

But this latter seems to-day, in the eyes of many an educator, to savour of a spirit of utter incorrigibility and depravation. And, though it may seem incredible, many a boy is told that the gallows tree is waiting for him because he has
shown certain traits which might be of inestimable value in the nation as a whole.

Just as the People's State must one day give its attention to training the will-power and capacity for decision among the youth, so too it must inculcate in the hearts of the young generation from early childhood onwards a readiness to accept responsibilities,
and the courage of open and frank avowal. 

If it recognizes the full significance of this necessity, finally--after a century of educative work--it will succeed in building up a
nation which will no longer be subject to those defeats that have contributed so
disastrously to bring about our present overthrow.

The formal imparting of knowledge, which constitutes the chief work of our
educational system to-day, will be taken over by the People's State with only few
modifications. These modifications must be made in three branches.

1. The brains of the young people must not generally be burdened with subjects of which 95% are useless to them and are therefore forgotten again. 

The curriculum of the primary and secondary schools presents an odd mixture at the present time. 

In many branches of study the subject matter to be learned has become so enormous that only a very small fraction of it can be remembered later on, and indeed only a very small fraction of this whole mass of knowledge can be used.

On the other hand, what is learned is insufficient for anybody who wishes to specialize in any certain branch for the purpose of earning his daily bread. 

Take, for example, the average civil servant who has passed through the GYMNASIUM or High School, and ask him at the age of 39 or 40 how much he has retained of the knowledge that was crammed into him with so much pains. 

How much is retained from all that was stuffed into his brain? He will certainly answer:
"Well, if a mass of stuff was then taught, it was not for the sole purpose of supplying the
student with a great stock of knowledge from which he could draw in later years, but it
served to develop the understanding, the memory, and above all it helped to strengthen
the thinking powers of the brain." That is partly true. 

And yet it is somewhat dangerous to submerge a young brain in a flood of impressions which it can hardly master and the
single elements of which it cannot discern or appreciate at their just value. 

It is mostly the essential part of this knowledge, and not the accidental, that is forgotten and sacrificed. Thus the principal purpose of this copious instruction is frustrated, for that purpose cannot be to make the brain capable of learning by simply offering it an enormous and varied amount of subjects for acquisition, but rather to furnish the individual with that stock of knowledge which he will need in later life and which he can use for the good of the community. 

This aim, however, is rendered illusory if, because of the superabundance of subjects that have been crammed into his head in
childhood, a person is able to remember nothing, or at least not the essential portion, of
all this in later life. There is no reason why millions of people should learn two or three
languages during the school years, when only a very small fraction will have the
opportunity to use these languages in later life and when most of them will therefore
forget those languages completely. 

Out of 100,000 students who learn French, there are probably not 2,000 who will be in a position to make use of this
accomplishment in later life, while 98,000 will never have a chance to utilize in practice what they have learned in youth. They have spent thousands of hours on a subject which will afterwards be without any value or importance to them. 

The argument that these matters form part of the general process of educating the mind is invalid. It would
be sound if all these people were able to use this learning in after life. 

But, as the situation stands, 98,000 are tortured to no purpose and waste their valuable time, only
for the sake of the 2,000 to whom the language will be of any use.

In the case of that language which I have chosen as an example it cannot be said that the learning of it educates the student in logical thinking or sharpens his mental acumen, as the learning of Latin, for instance, might be said to do. 

It would therefore be much  better to teach young students only the general outline, or, better, the inner structure of
such a language: that is to say, to allow them to discern the characteristic features of the
language, or perhaps to make them acquainted with the rudiments of its grammar, its
pronunciation, its syntax, style, etc.

That would be sufficient for average students, because it would provide a clearer view of the whole and could be more easily
remembered. And it would be more practical than the present-day attempt to cram into
their heads a detailed knowledge of the whole language, which they can never master
and which they will readily forget. 

If this method were adopted, then we should avoid the danger that, out of the superabundance of matter taught, only some fragments will
remain in the memory; for the youth would then have to learn what is worth while, and
the selection between the useful and the useless would thus have been made
beforehand.

As regards the majority of students the knowledge and understanding of the rudiments of a language would be quite sufficient for the rest of their lives. And those who really do need this language subsequently would thus have a foundation on which to start,
should they choose to make a more thorough study of it.

By adopting such a curriculum the necessary amount of time would be gained for physical exercises as well as for a more intense training in the various educational fields that have already been mentioned.

A reform of particular importance is that which ought to take place in the present methods of teaching history. Scarcely any other people are made to study as much of history as the Germans, and scarcely any other people make such a bad use of their
historical knowledge. 

If politics means history in the making, then our way of teaching history stands condemned by the way we have conducted our politics. But there would be no point in bewailing the lamentable results of our political conduct unless one is now determined to give our people a better political education. 

In 99 out of 100 cases the results of our present teaching of history are deplorable. Usually only a few dates, years of birth and names, remain in the memory, while a knowledge of the main and clearly defined lines of historical development is completely lacking. The essential
features which are of real significance are not taught. 

It is left to the more or less bright intelligence of the individual to discover the inner motivating urge amid the mass of
dates and chronological succession of events.

You may object as strongly as you like to this unpleasant statement. But read with attention the speeches which our parliamentarians make during one session alone on political problems and on questions of foreign policy in particular. Remember that those gentlemen are, or claim to be, the elite of the German nation and that at least a great number of them have sat on the benches of our secondary schools and that many of them have passed through our universities. 

Then you will realize how defective the historical education of these people has been. If these gentlemen had never studied 
history at all but had possessed a sound instinct for public affairs, things would have
gone better, and the nation would have benefited greatly thereby.

The subject matter of our historical teaching must be curtailed. 

The chief value of that teaching is to make the principal lines of historical development understood. The more our historical teaching is limited to this task, the more we may hope that it will turn out subsequently to be of advantage to the individual and, through the individual, to the community as a whole. 

For history must not be studied merely with a view to knowing what happened in the past but as a guide for the future, and to teach us what policy would be the best to follow for the preservation of our own people. 

That is the real end.

The teaching of history is only a means to attain this end. But here again the means has superseded the end in our contemporary education. The goal is completely forgotten. 

Do not reply that a profound study of history demands a detailed knowledge of all these dates because otherwise we could not fix the great lines of development. 

That task belongs to the professional historians. But the average man is not a professor of history. For him history has only one mission and that is to provide him with such an amount of historical knowledge as is necessary in order to enable him to form an independent opinion on the political affairs of his own country. 

The man who wants to become a professor of history can devote himself to all the details later on. Naturally he will have to occupy himself even with the smallest details. Of course our present teaching of history is not adequate to all this. Its scope is too vast for the average
student and too limited for the student who wishes to be an historical expert.

Finally, it is the business of the People's State to arrange for the writing of a world history in which the race problem will occupy a dominant position.
