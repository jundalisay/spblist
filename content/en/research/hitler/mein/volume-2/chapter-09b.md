The man at the front gladly welcomed the end of the strife in which so much blood had
been shed. He was happy to be able to return home and see his wife and children once
again. But he had no moral connection with the Revolution. He did not like it, nor did
he like those who had provoked and organized it. During the four-and-a-half years of
that bitter struggle at the front he had come to forget the party hyenas at home and all
their wrangling had become foreign to him.

The Revolution was really popular only with a small section of the German people:
namely, that class and their accomplices who had selected the rucksack as the hall-mark
of all honourable citizens in this new State. They did not like the Revolution for its own
sake, though many people still erroneously believe the contrary, but for the
consequences which followed in its train.

But it was very difficult to establish any abiding authority on the popular support given
to these Marxist freebooters. And yet the young Republic stood in need of authority at
any cost, unless it was ready to agree to be overthrown after a short period of chaos by
an elementary force assembled from those last elements that still remained among the
best extreme of the population.

The danger which those who were responsible for the Revolution feared most at that
time was that, in the turmoil of the confusion which they themselves had created, the
ground would suddenly be taken from under their feet, that they might be suddenly
seized and transported to another terrain by an iron grip, such as has often appeared at
these junctures in the history of nations. The Republic must be consolidated at all costs.
Hence it was forced almost immediately after its foundation to erect another pillar
beside that wavering pillar of popularity. They found that power must be organized
once again in order to procure a firmer foundation for their authority.

When those who had been the matadors of the Revolution in December 1918, and
January and February 1919, felt the ground trembling beneath their feet they looked
around them for men who would be ready to reinforce them with military support; for 
their feeble position was dependent only on whatever popular favour they enjoyed. The
'anti-militarist' Republic had need of soldiers. But the first and only pillar on which the
authority of the State rested, namely, its popularity, was grounded only on a
conglomeration of rowdies and thieves, burglars, deserters, shirkers, etc. Therefore in
that section of the nation which we have called the evil extreme it was useless to look
for men who would be willing to sacrifice their lives on behalf of a new ideal. The
section which had nourished the revolutionary idea and carried out the Revolution was
neither able nor willing to call on the soldiers to protect it. For that section had no wish
whatsoever to organize a republican State, but to disorganize what already existed and
thus satisfy its own instincts all the better. Their password was not the organization and
construction of the German Republic, but rather the plundering of it.

Hence the cry for help sent out by the public representatives, who were beset by a
thousand anxieties, did not find any response among this class of people, but rather
provoked a feeling of bitterness and repudiation. For they looked upon this step as the
beginning of a breach of faith and trust, and in the building up of an authority which
was no longer based on popular support but also on force they saw the beginning of a
hostile move against what the Revolution meant essentially for those elements. They
feared that measures might be taken against the right to robbery and absolute
domination on the part of a horde of thieves and plunderers--in short, the worst rabble--
who had broken out of the convict prisons and left their chains behind.

The representatives of the people might cry out as much as they liked, but they could
get no help from that rabble. The cries for help were met with the counter-cry 'traitors'
by those very people on whose support the popularity of the regime was founded.
Then for the first time large numbers of young Germans were found who were ready to
button on the military uniform once again in the service of 'Peace and Order', as they
believed, shouldering the carbine and rifle and donning the steel helmet to defend the
wreckers of the Fatherland. Volunteer corps were assembled and, although hating the
Revolution, they began to defend it. The practical effect of their action was to render the
Revolution firm and stable. In doing this they acted in perfect good faith.

The real organizer of the Revolution and the actual wire-puller behind it, the
international Jew, had sized up the situation correctly. The German people were not yet
ripe to be drawn into the blood swamp of Bolshevism, as the Russian people had been
drawn. And that was because there was a closer racial union between the intellectual
classes in Germany and the manual workers, and also because broad social strata were
permeated with cultured people, such as was the case also in the other States of Western
Europe; but this state of affairs was completely lacking in Russia. In that country the
intellectual classes were mostly not of Russian nationality, or at least they did not have
the racial characteristics of the Slav. The thin upper layer of intellectuals which then
existed in Russia might be abolished at any time, because there was no intermediate 
stratum connecting it organically with the great mass of the people. There the mental
and moral level of the great mass of the people was frightfully low.

In Russia the moment the agitators were successful in inciting broad masses of the
people, who could not read or write, against the upper layer of intellectuals who were
not in contact with the masses or permanently linked with them in any way--at that
moment the destiny of Russia was decided, the success of the Revolution was assured.
Thereupon the analphabetic Russian became the slave of his Jewish dictators who, on
their side, were shrewd enough to name their dictatorship 'The Dictatorship of the
People'.

In the case of Germany an additional factor must be taken into account. Here the
Revolution could be carried into effect only if the Army could first be gradually
dismembered. But the real author of the Revolution and of the process of disintegration
in the Army was not the soldier who had fought at the front but the CANAILLE which
more or less shunned the light and which were either quartered in the home garrisons
or were officiating as 'indispensables' somewhere in the business world at home. This
army was reinforced by ten thousand deserters who, without running any particular
risk, could turn their backs on the Front. At all times the real poltroon fears nothing so
much as death. But at the Front he had death before his eyes every day in a thousand
different shapes. There has always been one possible way, and one only, of making
weak or wavering men, or even downright poltroons, face their duty steadfastly. This
means that the deserter must be given to understand that his desertion will bring upon
him just the very thing he is flying from. At the Front a man may die, but the deserter
MUST die. Only this draconian threat against every attempt to desert the flag can have
a terrifying effect, not merely on the individual but also on the mass. Therein lay the
meaning and purpose of the military penal code.

It was a fine belief to think that the great struggle for the life of a nation could be carried
through if it were based solely on voluntary fidelity arising from and sustained by the
knowledge that such a struggle was necessary. The voluntary fulfilment of one's duty is
a motive that determines the actions of only the best men, but not of the average type of
men. Hence special laws are necessary; just as, for instance, the law against stealing,
which was not made for men who are honest on principle but for the weak and unstable
elements. Such laws are meant to hinder the evil-doer through their deterrent effect and
thus prevent a state of affairs from arising in which the honest man is considered the
more stupid, and which would end in the belief that it is better to have a share in the
robbery than to stand by with empty hands or allow oneself to be robbed.
It was a mistake to believe that in a struggle which, according to all human foresight,
might last for several years it would be possible to dispense with those expedients
which the experience of hundreds and even of thousands of years had proved to be 
effective in making weak and unstable men face and fulfil their duty in difficult times
and at moments of great nervous stress.

For the voluntary war hero it is, of course, not necessary to have the death penalty in
the military code, but it is necessary for the cowardly egoists who value their own lives
more than the existence of the community in the hour of national need. Such weak and
characterless people can be held back from surrendering to their cowardice only by the
application of the heaviest penalties. When men have to struggle with death every day
and remain for weeks in trenches of mire, often very badly supplied with food, the man
who is unsure of himself and begins to waver cannot be made to stick to his post by
threats of imprisonment or even penal servitude. Only by a ruthless enforcement of the
death penalty can this be effected. For experience shows that at such a time the recruit
considers prison a thousand times more preferable than the battlefield. In prison at least
his precious life is not in danger. The practical abolition of the death penalty during the
war was a mistake for which we had to pay dearly. Such omission really meant that the
military penal code was no longer recognized as valid. An army of deserters poured
into the stations at the rear or returned home, especially in 1918, and there began to
form that huge criminal organization with which we were suddenly faced, after
November 7th, 1918, and which perpetrated the Revolution.

The Front had nothing to do with all this. Naturally, the soldiers at the Front were
yearning for peace. But it was precisely that fact which represented a special danger for
the Revolution. For when the German soldiers began to draw near home, after the
Armistice, the revolutionaries were in trepidation and asked the same question again
and again: What will the troops from the Front do? Will the field-greys stand for it?
During those weeks the Revolution was forced to give itself at least an external
appearance of moderation, if it were not to run the risk of being wrecked in a moment
by a few German divisions. For at that time, even if the commander of one division
alone had made up his mind to rally the soldiers of his division, who had always
remained faithful to him, in an onslaught to tear down the red flag and put the
'councils' up against the wall, or, if there was any resistance, to break it with trenchmortars and hand grenades, that division would have grown into an army of sixty
divisions in less than four weeks. The Jew wire-pullers were terrified by this prospect
more than by anything else; and to forestall this particular danger they found it
necessary to give the Revolution a certain aspect of moderation. They dared not allow it
to degenerate into Bolshevism, so they had to face the existing conditions by putting up
the hypocritical picture of 'order and tranquillity'. Hence many important concessions,
the appeal to the old civil service and to the heads of the old Army. They would be
needed at least for a certain time, and only when they had served the purpose of Turks'
Heads could the deserved kick-out be administered with impunity. Then the Republic
would be taken entirely out of the hands of the old servants of the State and delivered
into the claws of the revolutionaries. 

They thought that this was the only plan which would succeed in duping the old
generals and civil servants and disarm any eventual opposition beforehand through the
apparently harmless and mild character of the new regime.
Practical experience has shown to what extent the plan succeeded.
The Revolution, however, was not made by the peaceful and orderly elements of the
nation but rather by rioters, thieves and robbers. And the way in which the Revolution
was developing did not accord with the intentions of these latter elements; still, on
tactical grounds, it was not possible to explain to them the reasons for the course things
were taking and make that course acceptable.

As Social Democracy gradually gained power it lost more and more the character of a
crude revolutionary party. Of course in their inner hearts the Social Democrats wanted
a revolution; and their leaders had no other end in view. Certainly not. But what finally
resulted was only a revolutionary programme; but not a body of men who would be
able to carry it out. A revolution cannot be carried through by a party of ten million
members. If such a movement were attempted the leaders would find that it was not an
extreme section of the population on which they had to depend butrather the broad
masses of the middle stratum; hence the inert masses.

Recognizing all this, already during the war, the Jews caused the famous split in the
Social Democratic Party. While the Social Democratic Party, conforming to the inertia of
its mass following, clung like a leaden weight on the neck of the national defence, the
actively radical elements were extracted from it and formed into new aggressive
columns for purposes of attack. The Independent Socialist Party and the Spartacist
League were the storm battalions of revolutionary Marxism. The objective assigned to
them was to create a FAIT ACCOMPLI, on the grounds of which the masses of the
Social Democratic Party could take their stand, having been prepared for this event long
beforehand. The feckless bourgeoisie had been estimated at its just value by the
Marxists and treated EN CANAILLE. Nobody bothered about it, knowing well that in
their canine servility the representatives of an old and worn-out generation would not
be able to offer any serious resistance.

When the Revolution had succeeded and its artificers believed that the main pillars of
the old State had been broken down, the Army returning from the Front began to
appear in the light of a sinister sphinx and thus made it necessary to slow down the
national course of the Revolution. The main body of the Social Democratic horde
occupied the conquered positions, and the Independent Socialist and Spartacist storm
battalions were side-tracked.
But that did not happen without a struggle. 

The activist assault formations that had started the Revolution were dissatisfied and felt
that they had been betrayed. They now wanted to continue the fight on their own
account. But their illimitable racketeering became odious even to the wire-pullers of the
Revolution. For the Revolution itself had scarcely been accomplished when two camps
appeared. In the one camp were the elements of peace and order; in the other were
those of blood and terror. Was it not perfectly natural that our bourgeoisie should rush
with flying colours to the camp of peace and order? For once in their lives their piteous
political organizations found it possible to act, inasmuch as the ground had been
prepared for them on which they were glad to get a new footing; and thus to a certain
extent they found themselves in coalition with that power which they hated but feared.
The German political bourgeoisie achieved the high honour of being able to associate
itself with the accursed Marxist leaders for the purpose of combating Bolshevism.
Thus the following state of affairs took shape as early as December 1918 and January
1919:

A minority constituted of the worst elements had made the Revolution. And behind this
minority all the Marxist parties immediately fell into step. The Revolution itself had an
outward appearance of moderation, which aroused against it the enmity of the fanatical
extremists. These began to launch hand-grenades and fire machine-guns, occupying
public buildings, thus threatening to destroy the moderate appearance of the
Revolution. To prevent this terror from developing further a truce was concluded
between the representatives of the new regime and the adherents of the old order, so as
to be able to wage a common fight against the extremists. The result was that the
enemies of the Republic ceased to oppose the Republic as such and helped to subjugate
those who were also enemies of the Republic, though for quite different reasons. But a
further result was that all danger of the adherents of the old State putting up a fight
against the new was now definitely averted.

This fact must always be clearly kept in mind. Only by remembering it can we
understand how it was possible that a nation in which nine-tenths of the people had not
joined in a revolution, where seven-tenths repudiated it and six-tenths detested it--how
this nation allowed the Revolution to be imposed upon it by the remaining one-tenth of
the population.

Gradually the barricade heroes in the Spartacist camp petered out, and so did the
nationalist patriots and idealists on the other side. As these two groups steadily
dwindled, the masses of the middle stratum, as always happens, triumphed. The
Bourgeoisie and the Marxists met together on the grounds of accomplished facts, and
the Republic began to be consolidated. At first, however, that did not prevent the
bourgeois parties from propounding their monarchist ideas for some time further,
especially at the elections, whereby they endeavoured to conjure up the spirits of the 
dead past to encourage their own feeble-hearted followers. It was not an honest
proceeding. In their hearts they had broken with the monarchy long ago; but the
foulness of the new regime had begun to extend its corruptive action and make itself
felt in the camp of the bourgeois parties. The common bourgeois politician now felt
better in the slime of republican corruption than in the severe decency of the defunct
State, which still lived in his memory.

As I have already pointed out, after the destruction of the old Army the revolutionary
leaders were forced to strengthen statal authority by creating a new factor of power. In
the conditions that existed they could do this only by winning over to their side the
adherents of a WELTANSCHAUUNG which was a direct contradiction of their own.
From those elements alone it was possible slowly to create a new army which, limited
numerically by the peace treaties, had to be subsequently transformed in spirit so as to
become an instrument of the new regime.

Setting aside the defects of the old State, which really became the cause of the
Revolution, if we ask how it was possible to carry the Revolution to a successful issue as
a political act, we arrive at the following conclusions:

1. It was due to a process of dry rot in our conceptions of duty and obedience.
2. It was due also to the passive timidity of the Parties who were supposed to uphold
the State.

To this the following must be added: The dry rot which attacked our concepts of duty
and obedience was fundamentally due to our wholly non-national and purely State
education. From this came the habit of confusing means and ends. Consciousness of
duty, fulfilment of duty, and obedience, are not ends in themselves no more than the
State is an end in itself; but they all ought to be employed as means to facilitate and
assure the existence of a community of people who are kindred both physically and
spiritually. At a moment when a nation is manifestly collapsing and when all outward
signs show that it is on the point of becoming the victim of ruthless oppression, thanks
to the conduct of a few miscreants, to obey these people and fulfil one's duty towards
them is merely doctrinaire formalism, and indeed pure folly; whereas, on the other
hand, the refusal of obedience and fulfilment of duty in such a case might save the
nation from collapse. According to our current bourgeois idea of the State, if a
divisional general received from above the order not to shoot he fulfilled his duty and
therefore acted rightly in not shooting, because to the bourgeois mind blind formal
obedience is a more valuable thing than the life of a nation. But according to the
National Socialist concept it is not obedience to weak superiors that should prevail at
such moments, in such an hour the duty of assuming personal responsibility towards
the whole nation makes its appearance.

The Revolution succeeded because that concept had ceased to be a vital force with our
people, or rather with our governments, and died down to something that was merely
formal and doctrinaire.

As regards the second point, it may be said that the more profound cause of the
fecklessness of the bourgeois parties must be attributed to the fact that the most active
and upright section of our people had lost their lives in the war. Apart from that, the
bourgeois parties, which may be considered as the only political formations that stood
by the old State, were convinced that they ought to defend their principles only by
intellectual ways and means, since the use of physical force was permitted only to the
State. That outlook was a sign of the weakness and decadence which had been
gradually developing. And it was also senseless at a period when there was a political
adversary who had long ago abandoned that standpoint and, instead of this, had
openly declared that he meant to attain his political ends by force whenever that
became possible. When Marxism emerged in the world of bourgeois democracy, as a
consequence of that democracy itself, the appeal sent out by the bourgeois democracy
to fight Marxism with intellectual weapons was a piece of folly for which a terrible
expiation had to be made later on. For Marxism always professed the doctrine that the
use of arms was a matter which had to be judged from the standpoint of expediency
and that success justified the use of arms.

This idea was proved correct during the days from November 7 to 10, 1918. The
Marxists did not then bother themselves in the least about parliament or democracy,
but they gave the death blow to both by turning loose their horde of criminals to shoot
and raise hell.

When the Revolution was over the bourgeois parties changed the title of their firm and
suddenly reappeared, the heroic leaders emerging from dark cellars or more lightsome
storehouses where they had sought refuge. But, just as happens in the case of all
representatives of antiquated institutions, they had not forgotten their errors or learned
anything new. Their political programme was grounded in the past, even though they
themselves had become reconciled to the new regime. Their aim was to secure a share
in the new establishment, and so they continued the use of words as their sole weapon.
Therefore after the Revolution the bourgeois parties also capitulated to the street in a
miserable fashion.

When the law for the Protection of the Republic was introduced the majority was not at
first in favour of it. But, confronted with two hundred thousand Marxists
demonstrating in the streets, the bourgeois 'statesmen' were so terror-stricken that they
voted for the Law against their wills, for the edifying reason that otherwise they feared
they might get their heads smashed by the enraged masses on leaving the Reichstag. 
And so the new State developed along its own course, as if there had been no national
opposition at all.

The only organizations which at that time had the strength and courage to face
Marxism and its enraged masses were first of all the volunteer corps (Note 19), and
subsequently the organizations for self-defence, the civic guards and finally the
associations formed by the demobilized soldiers of the old Army.

But the existence of these bodies did not appreciably change the course of German
history; and that for the following causes:
As the so-called national parties were without influence, because they had no force
which could effectively demonstrate in the street, the Leagues of Defence could not
exercise any influence because they had no political idea and especially because they
had no definite political aim in view.

The success which Marxism once attained was due to perfect co-operation between
political purposes and ruthless force. What deprived nationalist Germany of all
practical hopes of shaping German development was the lack of a determined cooperation between brute force and political aims wisely chosen.

Whatever may have been the aspirations of the 'national' parties, they had no force
whatsoever to fight for these aspirations, least of all in the streets.
The Defence Leagues had force at their disposal. They were masters of the street and of
the State, but they lacked political ideas and aims on behalf of which their forces might
have been or could have been employed in the interests of the German nation. The
cunning Jew was able in both cases, by his astute powers of persuasion, in reinforcing
an already existing tendency to make this unfortunate state of affairs permanent and at
the same time to drive the roots of it still deeper.

The Jew succeeded brilliantly in using his Press for the purpose of spreading abroad the
idea that the defence associations were of a 'non-political' character just as in politics he
was always astute enough to praise the purely intellectual character of the struggle and
demand that it must always be kept on that plane
Millions of German imbeciles then repeated this folly without having the slightest
suspicion that by so doing they were, for all practical purposes, disarming themselves
and delivering themselves defenceless into the hands of the Jew.
But there is a natural explanation of this also. The lack of a great idea which would reshape things anew has always meant a limitation in fighting power. The conviction of 
the right to employ even the most brutal weapons is always associated with an ardent
faith in the necessity for a new and revolutionary transformation of the world.
A movement which does not fight for such high aims and ideals will never have
recourse to extreme means.

The appearance of a new and great idea was the secret of success in the French
Revolution. The Russian Revolution owes its triumph to an idea. And it was only the
idea that enabled Fascism triumphantly to subject a whole nation to a process of
complete renovation.

Bourgeois parties are not capable of such an achievement. And it was not the bourgeois
parties alone that fixed their aim in a restoration of the past. The defence associations
also did so, in so far as they concerned themselves with political aims at all. The spirit of
the old war legions and Kyffauser tendencies lived in them and therewith helped
politically to blunt the sharpest weapons which the German nation then possessed and
allow them to rust in the hands of republican serfs. The fact that these associations were
inspired by the best of intentions in so doing, and certainly acted in good faith, does not
alter in the slightest degree the foolishness of the course they adopted.
In the consolidated REICHSWEHR Marxism gradually acquired the support of force,
which it needed for its authority. As a logical consequence it proceeded to abolish those
defence associations which it considered dangerous, declaring that they were now no
longer necessary. Some rash leaders who defied the Marxist orders were summoned to
court and sent to prison. But they all got what they had deserved.
The founding of the National Socialist German Labour Party incited a movement which
was the first to fix its aim, not in a mechanical restoration of the past--as the bourgeois
parties did--but in the substitution of an organic People's State for the present absurd
statal mechanism.

From the first day of its foundation the new movement took its stand on the principle
that its ideas had to be propagated by intellectual means but that, wherever necessary,
muscular force must be employed to support this propaganda. In accordance with their
conviction of the paramount importance of the new doctrine, the leaders of the new
movement naturally believe that no sacrifice can be considered too great when it is a
question of carrying through the purpose of the movement.

I have emphasized that in certain circumstances a movement which is meant to win
over the hearts of the people must be ready to defend itself with its own forces against
terrorist attempts on the part of its adversaries. It has invariably happened in the
history of the world that formal State authority has failed to break a reign of terror
which was inspired by a WELTANSCHAUUNG. It can only be conquered by a new 
and different WELTANSCHAUUNG whose representatives are quite as audacious and
determined. The acknowledgment of this fact has always been very unpleasant for the
bureaucrats who are the protectors of the State, but the fact remains nevertheless. The
rulers of the State can guarantee tranquillity and order only in case the State embodies a
WELTANSCHAUUNG which is shared in by the people as a whole; so that elements of
disturbance can be treated as isolated criminals, instead of being considered as the
champions of an idea which is diametrically opposed to official opinions. If such should
be the case the State may employ the most violent measures for centuries long against
the terror that threatens it; but in the end all these measures will prove futile, and the
State will have to succumb.

The German State is intensely overrun by Marxism. In a struggle that went on for
seventy years the State was not able to prevent the triumph of the Marxist idea. Even
though the sentences to penal servitude and imprisonment amounted in all to
thousands of years, and even though the most sanguinary methods of repression were
in innumerable instances threatened against the champions of the Marxist
WELTANSCHAUUNG, in the end the State was forced to capitulate almost completely.
The ordinary bourgeois political leaders will deny all this, but their protests are futile.
Seeing that the State capitulated unconditionally to Marxism on November 9th, 1918, it
will not suddenly rise up tomorrow as the conqueror of Marxism. On the contrary.
Bourgeois simpletons sitting on office stools in the various ministries babble about the
necessity of not governing against the wishes of the workers, and by the word 'workers'
they mean the Marxists. By identifying the German worker with Marxism not only are
they guilty of a vile falsification of the truth, but they thus try to hide their own collapse
before the Marxist idea and the Marxist organization.

In view of the complete subordination of the present State to Marxism, the National
Socialist Movement feels all the more bound not only to prepare the way for the
triumph of its idea by appealing to the reason and understanding of the public but also
to take upon itself the responsibility of organizing its own defence against the terror of
the International, which is intoxicated with its own victory.

I have already described how practical experience in our young movement led us
slowly to organize a system of defence for our meetings. This gradually assumed the
character of a military body specially trained for the maintenance of order, and tended
to develop into a service which would have its properly organized cadres.
This new formation might resemble the defence associations externally, but in reality
there were no grounds of comparison between the one and the other.

As I have already said, the German defence organizations did not have any definite
political ideas of their own. They really were only associations for mutual protection, 
and they were trained and organized accordingly, so that they were an illegal
complement or auxiliary to the legal forces of the State. Their character as free corps
arose only from the way in which they were constructed and the situation in which the
State found itself at that time. But they certainly could not claim to be free corps on the
grounds that they were associations formed freely and privately for the purpose of
fighting for their own freely formed political convictions. Such they were not, despite
the fact that some of their leaders and some associations as such were definitely
opposed to the Republic. For before we can speak of political convictions in the higher
sense we must be something more than merely convinced that the existing regime is
defective. Political convictions in the higher sense mean that one has the picture of a
new regime clearly before one's mind, feels that the establishment of this regime is an
absolute necessity and sets himself to carry out that purpose as the highest task to
which his life can be devoted.

The troops for the preservation of order, which were then formed under the National
Socialist Movement, were fundamentally different from all the other defence
associations by reason of the fact that our formations were not meant in any way to
defend the state of things created by the Revolution, but rather that they were meant
exclusively to support our struggle for the creation of a new Germany.
In the beginning this body was merely a guard to maintain order at our meetings. Its
first task was limited to making it possible for us to hold our meetings, which otherwise
would have been completely prevented by our opponents.

These men were at that time
trained merely for purposes of attack, but they were not taught to adore the big stick
exclusively, as was then pretended in stupid German patriotic circles. They used the
cudgel because they knew that it can be made impossible for high ideals to be put
forward if the man who endeavours to propagate them can be struck down with the
cudgel. As a matter of fact, it has happened in history not infrequently that some of the
greatest minds have perished under the blows of the most insignificant helots. Our
bodyguards did not look upon violence as an end in itself, but they protected the
expositors of ideal aims and purposes against hostile coercion by violence. They also
understood that there was no obligation to undertake the defence of a State which did
not guarantee the defence of the nation, but that, on the contrary, they had to defend the
nation against those who were threatening to destroy nation and State.

After the fight which took place at the meeting in the Munich Hofbräuhaus, where the
small number of our guards who were present won everlasting fame for themselves by
the heroic manner in which they stormed the adversaries; these guards were called THE
STORM DETACHMENT. As the name itself indicates, they represent only a
DETACHMENT of the Movement. They are one constituent element of it, just as is the
Press, the propaganda, educational institutes, and other sections of the Party.

We learned how necessary was the formation of such a body, not only from our
experience on the occasion of that memorable meeting but also when we sought
gradually to carry the Movement beyond Munich and extend it to the other parts of
Germany. Once we had begun to appear as a danger to Marxism the Marxists lost no
opportunity of trying to crush beforehand all preparations for the holding of National
Socialist meetings. When they did not succeed in this they tried to break up the meeting
itself. It goes without saying that all the Marxist organizations, no matter of what grade
or view, blindly supported the policy and activities of their representations in every
case. But what is to be said of the bourgeois parties who, when they were reduced to
silence by these same Marxists and in many places did not dare to send their speakers
to appear before the public, yet showed themselves pleased, in a stupid and
incomprehensible manner, every time we received any kind of set-back in our fight
against Marxism. The bourgeois parties were happy to think that those whom they
themselves could not stand up against, but had to knuckle down to, could not be
broken by us. What must be said of those State officials, chiefs of police, and even
cabinet ministers, who showed a scandalous lack of principle in presenting themselves
externally to the public as 'national' and yet shamelessly acted as the henchmen of the
Marxists in the disputes which we, National Socialists, had with the latter. 

What can be
said of persons who debased themselves so far, for the sake of a little abject praise in the
Jewish Press, that they persecuted those men to whose heroic courage and intervention,
regardless of risk, they were partly indebted for not having been torn to pieces by the
Red mob a few years previously and strung up to the lamp-posts?

One day these lamentable phenomena fired the late but unforgotten Prefect Pöhner--a
man whose unbending straightforwardness forced him to hate all twisters and to hate
them as only a man with an honest heart can hate--to say: "In all my life I wished to be
first a German and then an official, and I never wanted to mix up with these creatures
who, as if they were kept officials, prostituted themselves before anybody who could
play lord and master for the time being."

It was a specially sad thing that gradually tens of thousands of honest and loyal
servants of the State did not only come under the power of such people but were also
slowly contaminated by their unprincipled morals. Moreover, these kind of men
pursued honest officials with a furious hatred, degrading them and driving them from
their positions, and yet passed themselves off as 'national' by the aid of their lying
hypocrisy.

From officials of that kind we could expect no support, and only in very rare instances
was it given. Only by building up its own defence could our movement become secure
and attract that amount of public attention and general respect which is given to those
who can defend themselves when attacked. 

As an underlying principle in the internal development of the Storm Detachment, we
came to the decision that not only should it be perfectly trained in bodily efficiency but
that the men should be so instructed as to make them indomitably convinced
champions of the National Socialist ideas and, finally, that they should be schooled to
observe the strictest discipline. This body was to have nothing to do with the defence
organizations of the bourgeois type and especially not with any secret organization.
My reasons at that time for guarding strictly against letting the Storm Detachment of
the German National Socialist Labour Party appear as a defence association were as
follows:

On purely practical grounds it is impossible to build up a national defence organization
by means of private associations, unless the State makes an enormous contribution to it.
Whoever thinks otherwise overestimates his own powers. Now it is entirely out of the
question to form organizations of any military value for a definite purpose on the
principle of so-called 'voluntary discipline'. Here the chief support for enforcing orders,
namely, the power of inflicting punishment, is lacking. In the autumn, or rather in the
spring, of 1919 it was still possible to raise 'volunteer corps', not only because most of
the men who came forward at that time had been through the school of the old Army,
but also because the kind of duty imposed there constrained the individual to absolute
obedience at least for a definite period of time.

That spirit is entirely lacking in the volunteer defence organizations of to-day. The more
the defence association grows, the weaker its discipline becomes and so much the less
can one demand from the individual members. Thus the whole organization will more
and more assume the character of the old non-political associations of war comrades
and veterans.

It is impossible to carry through a voluntary training in military service for larger
masses unless one is assured absolute power of command. There will always be few
men who will voluntarily and spontaneously submit to that kind of obedience which is
considered natural and necessary in the Army.

Moreover, a proper system of military training cannot be developed where there are
such ridiculously scanty means as those at the disposal of the defence associations. The
principal task of such an institution must be to impart the best and most reliable kind of
instruction. Eight years have passed since the end of the War, and during that time
none of our German youth, at an age when formerly they would have had to do
military service, have received any systematic training at all. The aim of a defence
association cannot be to enlist here and now all those who have already received a
military training; for in that case it could be reckoned with mathematical accuracy when
the last member would leave the association. Even the younger soldier from 1918 will
no longer be fit for front-line service twenty years later, and we are approaching that 
state of things with a rapidity that gives cause for anxiety. Thus the defence associations
must assume more and more the aspect of the old ex-service men's societies. But that
cannot be the meaning and purpose of an institution which calls itself, not an
association of ex-service men but a DEFENCE association, indicating by this title that it
considers its task to be, not only to preserve the tradition of the old soldiers and hold
them together but also to propagate the idea of national defence and be able to carry
this idea into practical effect, which means the creation of a body of men who are fit and
trained for military defence.

But this implies that those elements will receive a military training which up to now
have received none. This is something that in practice is impossible for the defence
associations. Real soldiers cannot be made by a training of one or two hours per week.
In view of the enormously increasing demands which modern warfare imposes on each
individual soldier to-day, a military service of two years is barely sufficient to transform
a raw recruit into a trained soldier. At the Front during the War we all saw the fearful
consequences which our young recruits had to suffer from their lack of a thorough
military training. Volunteer formations which had been drilled for fifteen or twenty
weeks under an iron discipline and shown unlimited self-denial proved nevertheless to
be no better than cannon fodder at the Front. Only when distributed among the ranks of
the old and experienced soldiers could the young recruits, who had been trained for
four or six months, become useful members of a regiment. Guided by the 'old men',
they adapted themselves gradually to their task.

In the light of all this, how hopeless must the attempt be to create a body of fighting
troops by a so-called training of one or two hours in the week, without any definite
power of command and without any considerable means. In that way perhaps one
could refresh military training in old soldiers, but raw recruits cannot thus be
transformed into expert soldiers.

How such a proceeding produces utterly worthless results may also be demonstrated
by the fact that at the same time as these so-called volunteer defence associations, with
great effort and outcry and under difficulties and lack of necessities, try to educate and
train a few thousand men of goodwill (the others need not be taken into account) for
purposes of national defence, the State teaches our young men democratic and pacifist
ideas and thus deprives millions and millions of their national instincts, poisons their
logical sense of patriotism and gradually turns them into a herd of sheep who will
patiently follow any arbitrary command. Thus they render ridiculous all those attempts
made by the defence associations to inculcate their ideas in the minds of the German
youth.

Almost more important is the following consideration, which has always made me take
up a stand against all attempts at a so-called military training on the basis of the
volunteer associations. 

Assuming that, in spite of all the difficulties just mentioned, a defence association were
successful in training a certain number of Germans every year to be efficient soldiers,
not only as regards their mental outlook but also as regards bodily efficiency and the
expert handling of arms, the result must necessarily be null and void in a State whose
whole tendency makes it not only look upon such a defensive formation as undesirable
but even positively hate it, because such an association would completely contradict the
intimate aims of the political leaders, who are the corrupters of this State.

But anyhow, such a result would be worthless under governments which have
demonstrated by their own acts that they do not lay the slightest importance on the
military power of the nation and are not disposed to permit an appeal to that power
only in case that it were necessary for the protection of their own malignant existence.
And that is the state of affairs to-day. It is not ridiculous to think of training some ten
thousand men in the use of arms, and carry on that training surreptitiously, when a few
years previously the State, having shamefully sacrificed eight-and-a-half million highly
trained soldiers, not merely did not require their services any more, but, as a mark of
gratitude for their sacrifices, held them up to public contumely. Shall we train soldiers
for a regime which besmirched and spat upon our most glorious soldiers, tore the
medals and badges from their breasts, trampled on their flags and derided their
achievements? Has the present regime taken one step towards restoring the honour of
the old army and bringing those who destroyed and outraged it to answer for their
deeds? Not in the least. On the contrary, the people I have just referred to may be seen
enthroned in the highest positions under the State to-day. And yet it was said at
Leipzig: "Right goes with might." Since, however, in our Republic to-day might is in the
hands of the very men who arranged for the Revolution, and since that Revolution
represents a most despicable act of high treason against the nation--yea, the vilest act in
German history--there can surely be no grounds for saying that might of this character
should be enhanced by the formation of a new young army. It is against all sound
reason.

The importance which this State attached, after the Revolution of 1918, to the
reinforcement of its position from the military point of view is clearly and unmistakably
demonstrated by its attitude towards the large self-defence organizations which existed
in that period. They were not unwelcome as long as they were of use for the personal
protection of the miserable creatures cast up by the Revolution.
But the danger to these creatures seemed to disappear as the debasement of our people
gradually increased. As the existence of the defence associations no longer implied a
reinforcement of the national policy they became superfluous. Hence every effort was
made to disarm them and suppress them wherever that was possible. 

History records only a few examples of gratitude on the part of princes. But there is not
one patriot among the new bourgeoisie who can count on the gratitude of revolutionary
incendiaries and assassins, persons who have enriched themselves from the public spoil
and betrayed the nation. In examining the problem as to the wisdom of forming these
defence associations I have never ceased to ask: 'For whom shall I train these young
men? For what purpose will they be employed when they will have to be called out?'
The answer to these questions lays down at the same time the best rule for us to follow.
If the present State should one day have to call upon trained troops of this kind it
would never be for the purpose of defending the interests of the nation VIS-À-VIS those
of the stranger but rather to protect the oppressors of the nation inside the country
against the danger of a general outbreak of wrath on the part of a nation which has been
deceived and betrayed and whose interests have been bartered away.
For this reason it was decided that the Storm Detachment of the German National
Socialist Labour Party ought not to be in the nature of a military organization. It had to
be an instrument of protection and education for the National Socialist Movement and
its duties should be in quite a different sphere from that of the military defence
association.

And, of course, the Storm Detachment should not be in the nature of a secret
organization. Secret organizations are established only for purposes that are against the
law. Therewith the purpose of such an organization is limited by its very nature.
Considering the loquacious propensities of the German people, it is not possible to
build up any vast organization, keeping it secret at the same time and cloaking its
purpose. Every attempt of that kind is destined to turn out absolutely futile. It is not
merely that our police officials to-day have at their disposal a staff of eaves-droppers
and other such rabble who are ready to play traitor, like Judas, for thirty pieces of silver
and will betray whatever secrets they can discover and will invent what they would like
to reveal. In order to forestall such eventualities, it is never possible to bind one's own
followers to the silence that is necessary. Only small groups can become really secret
societies, and that only after long years of filtration. But the very smallness of such
groups would deprive them of all value for the National Socialist Movement. What we
needed then and need now is not one or two hundred dare-devil conspirators but a
hundred thousand devoted champions of our WELTANSCHAUUNG. The work must
not be done through secret conventicles but through formidable mass demonstrations
in public. Dagger and pistol and poison-vial cannot clear the way for the progress of the
movement. That can be done only by winning over the man in the street. We must
overthrow Marxism, so that for the future National Socialism will be master of the
street, just as it will one day become master of the State.

There is another danger connected with secret societies. It lies in the fact that their
members often completely misunderstand the greatness of the task in hand and are apt 
to believe that a favourable destiny can be assured for the nation all at once by means of
a single murder. Such a belief may find historical justification by appealing to cases
where a nation had been suffering under the tyranny of some oppressor who at the
same time was a man of genius and whose extraordinary personality guaranteed the
internal solidity of his position and enabled him to maintain his fearful oppression. In
such cases a man may suddenly arise from the ranks of the people who is ready to
sacrifice himself and plunge the deadly steel into the heart of the hated individual. In
order to look upon such a deed as abhorrent one must have the republican mentality of
that petty CANAILLE who are conscious of their own crime. But the greatest champion
(Note 20) of liberty that the German people have ever had has glorified such a deed in
WILLIAM TELL.

During 1919 and 1920 there was danger that the members of secret organizations, under
the influence of great historical examples and overcome by the immensity of the
nation's misfortunes, might attempt to wreak vengeance on the destroyers of their
country, under the belief that this would end the miseries of the people. All such
attempts were sheer folly, for the reason that the Marxist triumph was not due to the
superior genius of one remarkable person but rather to immeasurable incompetence
and cowardly shirking on the part of the bourgeoisie. The hardest criticism that can be
uttered against our bourgeoisie is simply to state the fact that it submitted to the
Revolution, even though the Revolution did not produce one single man of eminent
worth. One can always understand how it was possible to capitulate before a
Robespierre, a Danton, or a Marat; but it was utterly scandalous to go down on all fours
before the withered Scheidemann, the obese Herr Erzberger, Frederick Ebert, and the
innumerable other political pigmies of the Revolution. There was not a single man of
parts in whom one could see the revolutionary man of genius. Therein lay the country's
misfortune; for they were only revolutionary bugs, Spartacists wholesale and retail. To
suppress one of them would be an act of no consequence. The only result would be that
another pair of bloodsuckers, equally fat and thirsty, would be ready to take his place.
During those years we had to take up a determined stand against an idea which owed
its origin and foundation to historical episodes that were really great, but to which our
own despicable epoch did not bear the slightest similarity.

The same reply may be given when there is question of putting somebody 'on the spot' who has acted as a traitor to his country. It would be ridiculous and illogical to shoot a poor wretch (Note 21) who had betrayed the position of a howitzer to the enemy while the highest positions of the government are occupied by a rabble who bartered away a whole empire, who have on their consciences the deaths of two million men who were sacrificed in vain, fellows who were responsible for the millions maimed in the war and who make a thriving business out of the republican regime without allowing their souls to be disturbed in any way. It would be absurd to do away with small traitors in a State whose government has absolved the great traitors from all punishment. For it might easily happen that one day an honest idealist, who, out of love for his country, had removed from circulation some miserable informer that had given information about secret stores of arms might now be called to answer for his act before the chief traitors of the country. And there is still an important question: Shall some small traitorous creature be suppressed by another small traitor, or by an idealist? In the former case the result would be doubtful and the deed would almost surely be revealed later on. In the second case a petty rascal is put out of the way and the life of an idealist who may be irreplaceable is in jeopardy.

Small thieves should not be hanged while big thieves are allowed to go free.

One day, a national tribunal will have to judge and sentence tens of thousands of organizers who were responsible for the criminal November betrayal and all the consequences that followed on it. 

Such an example will teach the necessary lesson, once and for ever, to those paltry traitors who revealed to the enemy the places where arms were hidden.

On the grounds of these considerations I steadfastly forbade all participation in secret
societies, and I took care that the Storm Detachment should not assume such a
character. During those years I kept the National Socialist Movement away from those
experiments which were being undertaken by young Germans who for the most part
were inspired with a sublime idealism but who became the victims of their own deeds,
because they could not ameliorate the lot of their fatherland to the slightest degree.

If then the Storm Detachment must not be either a military defence organization or a secret society, the following conclusions must result:

1. Its training must not be organized from the military standpoint but from the standpoint of what is most practical for party purposes. 

Seeing that its members must
undergo a good physical training, the place of chief importance must not be given to
military drill but rather to the practice of sports. I have always considered boxing and
ju-jitsu more important than some kind of bad, because mediocre, training in rifleshooting. If the German nation were presented with a body of young men who had
been perfectly trained in athletic sports, who were imbued with an ardent love for their
country and a readiness to take the initiative in a fight, then the national State could
make an army out of that body within less than two years if it were necessary, provided
the cadres already existed. In the actual state of affairs only the REICHSWEHR could
furnish the cadres and not a defence organization that was neither one thing nor the
other. Bodily efficiency would develop in the individual a conviction of his superiority
and would give him that confidence which is always based only on the consciousness of
one's own powers. They must also develop that athletic agility which can be employed
as a defensive weapon in the service of the Movement. 

2. In order to safeguard the Storm Detachment against any tendency towards secrecy,
not only must the uniform be such that it can immediately be recognized by everybody,
but the large number of its effectives show the direction in which the Movement is
going and which must be known to the whole public. The members of the Storm
Detachment must not hold secret gatherings but must march in the open and thus, by
their actions, put an end to all legends about a secret organization. In order to keep
them away from all temptations towards finding an outlet for their activities in small
conspiracies, from the very beginning we had to inculcate in their minds the great idea
of the Movement and educate them so thoroughly to the task of defending this idea that
their horizon became enlarged and that the individual no longer considered it his
mission to remove from circulation some rascal or other, whether big or small, but to
devote himself entirely to the task of bringing about the establishment of a new
National Socialist People's State. In this way the struggle against the present State was
placed on a higher plane than that of petty revenge and small conspiracies. It was
elevated to the level of a spiritual struggle on behalf of a WELTANSCHAUUNG, for the
destruction of Marxism in all its shapes and forms.

3. The form of organization adopted for the Storm Detachment, as well as its uniform
and equipment, had to follow different models from those of the old Army. They had to
be specially suited to the requirements of the task that was assigned to the Storm
Detachment.

These were the ideas I followed in 1920 and 1921. I endeavoured to instil them gradually into the members of the young organization. And the result was that by the midsummer of 1922 we had a goodly number of formations which consisted of a hundred men each. By the late autumn of that year these formations received their distinctive uniforms. There were three events which turned out to be of supreme importance for the subsequent development of the Storm Detachment.

1. The great mass demonstration against the Law for the Protection of the Republic. This demonstration was held in the late summer of 1922 on the KÖNIGS-PLATZ in Munich, by all the patriotic societies. The National Socialist Movement also participated in it. The march-past of our party, in serried ranks, was led by six Munich companies of a hundred men each, followed by the political sections of the Party. Two bands marched with us and about fifteen flags were carried. When the National Socialists arrived at the great square it was already half full, but no flag was flying. Our entry aroused unbounded enthusiasm. I myself had the honour of being one of the speakers who addressed that mass of about sixty thousand people.

The demonstration was an overwhelming success; especially because it was proved for the first time that nationalist Munich could march on the streets, in spite of all threats from the Reds. Members of the organization for the defence of the Red Republic endeavoured to hinder the marching columns by their terrorist activities, but they were scattered by the companies of the Storm Detachment within a few minutes and sent off with bleeding skulls. The National Socialist Movement had then shown for the first time that in future it was determined to exercise the right to march on the streets and thus take this monopoly away from the international traitors and enemies of the country. The result of that day was an incontestable proof that our ideas for the creation of the Storm Detachment were right, both from the psychological viewpoint and as to the manner in which this body was organized.

On the basis of this success the enlistment progressed so rapidly that within a few
weeks the number of Munich companies of a hundred men each became doubled.

2. The expedition to Coburg in October 1922.
Certain People's Societies had decided to hold a German Day at Coburg. I was invited
to take part, with the intimation that they wished me to bring a following along. This
invitation, which I received at eleven o'clock in the morning, arrived just in time. Within
an hour the arrangements for our participation in the German Congress were ready. I
picked eight hundred men of the Storm Detachment to accompany me. These were
divided into about fourteen companies and had to be brought by special train from
Munich to Coburg, which had just voted by plebiscite to be annexed to Bavaria.
Corresponding orders were given to other groups of the National Socialist Storm
Detachment which had meanwhile been formed in various other localities.

This was the first time that such a special train ran in Germany. At all the places where
the new members of the Storm Detachment joined us our train caused a sensation.
Many of the people had never seen our flag. And it made a very great impression.
As we arrived at the station in Coburg we were received by a deputation of the
organizing committee of the German Day. They announced that it had been 'arranged'
at the orders of local trades unions--that is to say, the Independent and Communist
Parties--that we should not enter the town with our flags unfurled and our band
playing (we had a band consisting of forty-two musicians with us) and that we should
not march with closed ranks.

I immediately rejected these unmilitary conditions and did not fail to declare before the
gentlemen who had arranged this 'day' how astonished I was at the idea of their
negotiating with such people and coming to an agreement with them. Then I
announced that the Storm Troops would immediately march into the town in company
formation, with our flags flying and the band playing.
And that is what happened. 

As we came out into the station yard we were met by a growling and yelling mob of several thousand, that shouted at us: 'Assassins', 'Bandits', 'Robbers', 'Criminals'. These were the choice names which these exemplary founders of the German Republic showered on us. The young Storm Detachment gave a model example of order. 

The companies fell into formation on the square in front of the station and at first took no notice of the insults hurled at them by the mob. The police were anxious. They did not pilot us to the quarters assigned to us on the outskirts of Coburg, a city quite unknown to us, but to the Hofbräuhaus Keller in the centre of the town. Right and left of our march the tumult raised by the accompanying mob steadily increased. Scarcely had the last company entered the courtyard of the Hofbräuhaus when the huge mass made a rush to get in after them, shouting madly. In order to prevent this, the police closed the gates. Seeing the position was untenable I called the Storm Detachment to attention and then asked the police to open the gates immediately. After a good deal of hesitation, they consented.

We now marched back along the same route as we had come, in the direction of our
quarters, and there we had to make a stand against the crowd. As their cries and yells
all along the route had failed to disturb the equanimity of our companies, the
champions of true Socialism, Equality, and Fraternity now took to throwing stones.
That brought our patience to an end. For ten minutes long, blows fell right and left, like
a devastating shower of hail. Fifteen minutes later there were no more Reds to be seen
in the street.

The collisions which took place when the night came on were more serious. Patrols of
the Storm Detachment had discovered National Socialists who had been attacked singly
and were in an atrocious state. Thereupon we made short work of the opponents. By the
following morning the Red terror, under which Coburg had been suffering for years,
was definitely smashed.

Adopting the typically Marxist and Jewish method of spreading falsehoods, leaflets were distributed by hand on the streets, bearing the caption: "Comrades and Comradesses of the International Proletariat." These leaflets were meant to arouse the wrath of the populace. Twisting the facts completely around, they declared that our 'bands of assasins' had commenced 'a war of extermination against the peaceful
workers of Coburg'. 

At half-past one that day there was to be a 'great popular demonstration', at which it was hoped that the workers of the whole district would turn up. I was determined finally to crush this Red terror and so I summoned the Storm Detachment to meet at midday. 

Their number had now increased to 1,500. I decided to march with these men to the Coburg Festival and to cross the big square where the Red demonstration was to take place. I wanted to see if they would attempt to assault us again. 

When we entered the square we found that instead of the ten thousand that had been advertised, there were only a few hundred people present. As we approached they remained silent for the most part, and some ran away. Only at certain points along the  route some bodies of Reds, who had arrived from outside the city and had not yet come to know us, attempted to start a row. 

But a few fisticuffs put them to flight. And now one could see how the population, which had for such a long time been so wretchedly intimidated, slowly woke up and recovered their courage. They welcomed us openly,
and in the evening, on our return march, spontaneous shouts of jubilation broke out at
several points along the route.

At the station the railway employees informed us all of a sudden that our train would not move. Thereupon I had some of the ringleaders told that if this were the case I would have all the Red Party heroes arrested that fell into our hands, that we would drive the train ourselves, but that we would take away with us, in the locomotive and tender and in some of the carriages, a few dozen members of this brotherhood of
international solidarity. 

I did not omit to let those gentry know that if we had to conduct the train the journey would undoubtedly be a very risky adventure and that we might all break our necks. It would be a consolation, however, to know that we should not go to Eternity alone, but in equality and fraternity with the Red gentry.

Thereupon the train departed punctually and we arrived next morning in Munich safe
and sound.

Thus at Coburg, for the first time since 1914, the equality of all citizens before the law was re-established. For even if some coxcomb of a higher official should assert to-day that the State protects the lives of its citizens, at least in those days it was not so. For at that time the citizens had to defend themselves against the representatives of the present State.

At first it was not possible fully to estimate the importance of the consequences which resulted from that day. The victorious Storm Troops had their confidence in themselves considerably reinforced and also their faith in the sagacity of their leaders. 

Our contemporaries began to pay us special attention and for the first time many recognized the National Socialist Movement as an organization that in all probability was destined
to bring the Marxist folly to a deserving end.

Only the democrats lamented the fact that we had not the complaisance to allow our skulls to be cracked and that we had dared, in a democratic Republic, to hit back with fists and sticks at a brutal assault, rather than with pacifist chants.

Generally speaking, the bourgeois Press was partly distressed and partly vulgar, as always. Only a few decent newspapers expressed their satisfaction that at least in one locality the Marxist street bullies had been effectively dealt with.

And in Coburg itself at least a part of the Marxist workers who must be looked upon as misled, learned from the blows of National Socialist fists that these workers were also  fighting for ideals, because experience teaches that the human being fights only for something in which he believes and which he loves.

The Storm Detachment itself benefited most from the Coburg events. It grew so quickly in numbers that at the Party Congress in January 1923 six thousand men participated in the ceremony of consecrating the flags and the first companies were fully clad in their new uniform.

Our experience in Coburg proved how essential it is to introduce one distinctive
uniform for the Storm Detachment, not only for the purpose of strengthening the
ESPRIT DE CORPS but also to avoid confusion and the danger of not recognizing the
opponent in a squabble. Up to that time they had merely worn the armlet, but now the
tunic and the well-known cap were added.

But the Coburg experience had also another important result. We now determined to break the Red Terror in all those localities where for many years it had prevented men of other views from holding their meetings. We were determined to restore the right of free assembly. 

From that time onwards we brought our battalions together in such places and little by little the red citadels of Bavaria, one after another, fell before the National Socialist propaganda. The Storm Troops became more and more adept at their job. 

They increasingly lost all semblance of an aimless and lifeless defence movement and came out into the light as an active militant organization, fighting for the
establishment of a new German State.

This logical development continued until March 1923. Then an event occurred which made me divert the Movement from the course hitherto followed and introduce some changes in its outer formation.

In the first months of 1923 the French occupied the Ruhr district. The consequence of this was of great importance in the development of the Storm Detachment. 

It is not yet possible, nor would it be in the interest of the nation, to write or speak openly and freely on the subject. I shall speak of it only as far as the matter has been dealt with in public discussions and thus brought to the knowledge of everybody. 

The occupation of the Ruhr district, which did not come as a surprise to us, gave grounds for hoping that Germany would at last abandon its cowardly policy of submission and therewith give the defensive associations a definite task to fulfil. 

The Storm Detachment also, which now numbered several thousand of robust and vigorous young men, should not be excluded from this national service. During the spring and summer of 1923 it was transformed into a fighting military organization. 

It is to this reorganization that we must in great part attribute the later developments that took place during 1923, in so far as it affected our Movement. 

Elsewhere I shall deal in broad outline with the development of events in 1923. Here I wish only to state that the transformation of the Storm Detachment at that time must have been detrimental to the interests of the Movement if the conditions that had motivated the change were not to be carried into effect, namely, the adoption of a policy of active resistance against France.

The events which took place at the close of 1923, terrible as they may appear at first sight, were almost a necessity if looked at from a higher standpoint; because, in view of the attitude taken by the Government of the German REICH, conversion of the Storm Troops into a military force would be meaningless and thus a transformation which would also be harmful to the Movement was ended at one stroke. At the same time it was made possible for us to reconstruct at the point where we had been diverted from the proper course.

In the year 1925 the German National Socialist Labour Party was re-founded and had to organize and train its Storm Detachment once again according to the principles I have laid down. It must return to the original idea and once more it must consider its most essential task to function as the instrument of defence and reinforcement in the spiritual struggle to establish the ideals of the Movement.


The Storm Detachment must not be allowed to sink to the level of something in the nature of a defence organization or a secret society. Steps must be taken rather to make it a vanguard of 100,000 men in the struggle for the National Socialist ideal which is based on the profound principle of a People's State.

[Note 19. After the DEBACLE of 1918 several semi-military associations were formed by demobilized officers who had fought at the Front. These were semi-clandestine associations and were known as FREIKORPS (Volunteer corps). Their principal purpose was to act as rallying centres for the old nationalist elements.]
