THE ECHOES of our first great meeting, in the banquet hall of the Hofbräuhaus on February 24th, 1920, had not yet died away when we began preparations for our next meeting. 

Up to that time we had to consider carefully the venture of holding a small meeting every month or at most every fortnight in a city like Munich; but now it was decided that we should hold a mass meeting every week. 

I need not say that we anxiously asked ourselves on each occasion again and again: Will the people come and will they listen? 

Personally I was firmly convinced that if once they came they would remain and listen.

During that period the hall of the Hofbrau Haus in Munich acquired for us, National Socialists, a sort of mystic significance. Every week there was a meeting, almost always in that hall, and each time the hall was better filled than on the former occasion, and our public more attentive.

Starting with the theme, 'Responsibility for the War,' which nobody at that time cared about, and passing on to the discussion of the peace treaties, we dealt with almost everything that served to stimulate the minds of our audience and make them interested in our ideas. We drew attention to the peace treaties. What the new movement prophesied again and again before those great masses of people has been fulfilled almost in every detail.

To-day it is easy to talk and write about these things. But in those days a public mass meeting which was attended not by the small bourgeoisie but by proletarians who had been aroused by agitators, to criticize the Peace Treaty of Versailles meant an attack on the Republic and an evidence of reaction, if not of
monarchist tendencies.

The moment one uttered the first criticism of the Versailles Treaty one could expect an immediate reply, which became almost stereotyped: 'And Brest-Litowsk?' 'Brest-Litowsk!' And then the crowd would murmur and the murmur would gradually swell into a roar, until the speaker would have to give up his attempt
to persuade them. 

It would be like knocking one's head against a wall, so desperate were these people. They would not listen nor understand that Versailles was a scandal and a disgrace and that the dictate signified an act of highway robbery against our people. 

The disruptive work done by the Marxists and the poisonous propaganda of the external enemy had robbed these people of their reason. And one had no right to complain. For the guilt on this side was enormous. What had the German bourgeoisie done to call a halt to this terrible campaign of disintegration, to oppose it and open a way to a recognition of the truth by giving a better and more thorough explanation of the situation than that of the Marxists? 

Nothing, nothing. At that time I never saw those who are now the great apostles of the people. Perhaps they spoke to select groups, at tea parties of their own little coteries; but there where they should have been, where the wolves were at work, they never risked their appearance, unless it gave them the
opportunity of yelling in concert with the wolves.

As for myself, I then saw clearly that for the small group which first composed our movement the question of war guilt had to be cleared up, and cleared up in the light of historical truth. A preliminary condition for the future success of our movement was that it should bring knowledge of the meaning of the peace treaties to the minds of the popular masses. 

In the opinion of the masses, the peace treaties then signified a democratic success. Therefore, it was necessary to take the opposite side and dig ourselves into the minds of the people as the enemies of the peace treaties; so that later on, when the naked truth of this despicable swindle would be disclosed in all its hideousness, the people would recall the position which we then took and would give us their confidence.

Already at that time I took up my stand on those important fundamental questions where public opinion had gone wrong as a whole. I opposed these wrong notions without regard either for popularity or for hatred, and I was ready to face the fight. The National Socialist German Labour Party ought not to be the beadle but rather the master of public opinion. 

It must not serve the masses but rather dominate them.

In the case of every movement, especially during its struggling stages, there is naturally a temptation to conform to the tactics of an opponent and use the same battle-cries, when his tactics have succeeded in leading the people to crazy conclusions or to adopt mistaken attitudes towards the questions at issue. This temptation is particularly strong when motives can be found, though they are entirely illusory, that seem to point towards the same ends which the young movement is aiming at. 

Human poltroonery will then all the more readily adopt those arguments which give it a semblance of justification, 'from its own point of view,' in participating in the criminal policy which the adversary is following.

On several occasions I have experienced such cases, in which the greatest energy had to be employed to prevent the ship of our movement from being drawn into a general current which had been started artificially, and indeed from sailing with it. 

The last occasion was when our German Press, the Hecuba of the existence of the German nation, succeeded in bringing the question of South Tyrol into a position of importance which was seriously damaging to the nterests of the German people. 

Without considering what interests they were serving, several so-called 'national' men, parties and leagues, joined in the general cry, simply for fear of public opinion which had been excited by the Jews, and foolishly contributed to help in the struggle against a system which we Germans ought, particularly in those days, to consider as the one ray of light in this distracted world. 

While the international World-Jew is slowly but surely strangling us, our so-called patriots vociferate against a man and his system which have had the courage to liberate themselves from the shackles of Jewish Freemasonry at least in one quarter of the globe and to set the forces of national resistance against the
international world-poison. 

But weak characters were tempted to set their sails according to the direction of the wind and capitulate before the shout of public opinion. 

For it was veritably a capitulation. They are so much in the habit of lying and so morally base that men may not admit this even to themselves, but the truth remains that only cowardice and fear of the public feeling aroused by the Jews induced certain people to join in the hue and cry. All the other reasons put forward were only miserable excuses of paltry culprits who were conscious of their own crime.

There it was necessary to grasp the rudder with an iron hand and turn the movement about, so as to save it from a course that would have led it on the rocks. Certainly to attempt such a change of course was not a popular manoeuvre at that time, because all the leading forces of public opinion had been active and a great flame of public feeling illuminated only one direction. Such a decision almost always brings disfavour on those who dare to take it. In the course of history not a few men have been stoned for an act for which posterity has afterwards thanked them on its knees.

But a movement must count on posterity and not on the plaudits of the movement. It may well be that at such moments certain individuals have to endure hours of anguish; but they should not forget that the moment of liberation will come and that a movement which purposes to reshape the world must serve the future and not the passing hour.

On this point it may be asserted that the greatest and most enduring successes in history are mostly those which were least understood at the beginning, because they were in strong contrast to public opinion and the views and wishes of the time. We had experience of this when we made our own first public appearance. 

In all truth it can be said that we did not court public favour but made an onslaught on the follies of our people. In those days the following happened almost always: I presented myself before an assembly of men who believed the opposite of what I wished to say and who wanted the opposite of what I believed in. Then I had to spend a couple of hours in persuading two or three thousand people to give up the opinions they had first held, in destroying the foundations of their views with one blow after another and finally in leading them over to take their stand on the grounds of our own convictions and our WELTANSCHAUUNG. 

I learned something that was important at that time, namely, to snatch from the hands
of the enemy the weapons which he was using in his reply. I soon noticed that our
adversaries, especially in the persons of those who led the discussion against us, were
furnished with a definite repertoire of arguments out of which they took points against
our claims which were being constantly repeated. The uniform character of this mode of
procedure pointed to a systematic and unified training. And so we were able to
recognize the incredible way in which the enemy's propagandists had been disciplined,
and I am proud to-day that I discovered a means not only of making this propaganda
ineffective but of beating the artificers of it at their own work. Two years later I was
master of that art.

In every speech which I made it was important to get a clear idea beforehand of the
probable form and matter of the counter-arguments we had to expect in the discussion,
so that in the course of my own speech these could be dealt with and refuted. To this
end it was necessary to mention all the possible objections and show their
inconsistency; it was all the easier to win over an honest listener by expunging from his
memory the arguments which had been impressed upon it, so that we anticipated our
replies. What he had learned was refuted without having been mentioned by him and
that made him all the more attentive to what I had to say.

That was the reason why, after my first lecture on the 'Peace Treaty of Versailles,' which
I delivered to the troops while I was still a political instructor in my regiment, I made an
alteration in the title and subject and henceforth spoke on 'The Treaties of Brest-Litowsk
and Versailles.' For after the discussion which followed my first lecture I quickly
ascertained that in reality people knew nothing about the Treaty of Brest-Litowsk and
that able party propaganda had succeeded in presenting that Treaty as one of the most
scandalous acts of violence in the history of the world.

As a result of the persistency with which this falsehood was repeated again and again
before the masses of the people, millions of Germans saw in the Treaty of Versailles a
just castigation for the crime we had committed at Brest-Litowsk. Thus they considered
all opposition to Versailles as unjust and in many cases there was an honest moral
dislike to such a proceeding. And this was also the reason why the shameless and
monstrous word 'Reparations' came into common use in Germany. This hypocritical
falsehood appeared to millions of our exasperated fellow countrymen as the fulfilment
of a higher justice. 

It is a terrible thought, but the fact was so. 

The best proof of this was
the propaganda which I initiated against Versailles by explaining the Treaty of BrestLitowsk. I compared the two treaties with one another, point by point, and showed how in truth the one treaty was immensely humane, in contradistinction to the inhuman barbarity of the other. The effect was very striking. Then I spoke on this theme before an assembly of two thousand persons, during which I often saw three thousand six
hundred hostile eyes fixed on me.

Three hours later I had in front of me a swaying mass of righteous indignation and fury. A great lie had been uprooted from the hearts and brains of a crowd composed of thousands of individuals and a truth had been
implanted in its place.

The two lectures--that 'On the Causes of the World War' and 'On the Peace Treaties of Brest-Litowsk and Versailles' respectively--I then considered as the most important of all. Therefore I repeated them dozens of times, always giving them a new intonation; 

until at least on those points a definitely clear and unanimous opinion reigned among those from whom our movement recruited its first members. 

Furthermore, these gatherings brought me the advantage that I slowly became a platform orator at mass meetings, and gave me practice in the pathos and gesture required in large halls that held thousands of people.
