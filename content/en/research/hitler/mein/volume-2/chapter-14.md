Two considerations induce me to make a special analysis of Germany's position in regard to Russia:

1. This may prove to be the most decisive point in determining Germany's foreign policy.

2. The problem which has to be solved in this connection is also a touchstone to test the political capacity of the young National Socialist Movement for clear thinking and acting along the right lines.


The second consideration has often been a source of great anxiety to me. 

The members of our movement are extremists. 

 <!-- not recruited from circles which are habitually indifferent to public affairs, but mostly from among men who hold more or less extreme views.  -->

Their understanding of foreign politics naturally suffers from the prejudice and ignorance. 

 <!-- inadequate knowledge of those circles to which they were formerly attached by political and ideological ties.  -->

This is true not merely of the men who come to us from the Left. 

Our members who have received subversive teachings which have been counterbalanced by the instinct of self-preservation.

<!-- On the contrary, however subversive may have been the kind of teaching they formerly received in regard to these problems, in very many cases this was at least partly  residue of sound and natural instincts which remained.

In such cases it is only necessary to substitute a better teaching in place of the earlier influences, in order to transform the  into valuable assets. -->

<!-- and other sound instincts -->

But it is much more difficult to impress definite political ideas to the partisans of the Left. 

<!-- on the minds of men whose earlier political education was not less nonsensical and illogical than that given   -->

They have sacrificed their natural instincts to worship some abstract and entirely objective theory.

It is particularly difficult to induce them to take a realistic and logical view of their own interests and the interests of their nation in its relations with foreign countries. 

 <!-- representatives of our so-called intellectual circles -->

<!-- Their minds are overladen with a huge burden of prejudices and absurd ideas and they have lost or renounced every instinct of selfpreservation. With those men also the National Socialist Movement  -->

We have to fight a hard battle with them. 

<!-- And the struggle is all the harder because, though very often they are utterly incompetent, they are so self-conceited that, without the slightest justification, they look down with disdain on ordinary commonsense people.  -->

These arrogant snobs pretend to know better than other people. They are wholly incapable of:
- calmly analysing a problem
- weighing its pros and cons

These are the necessary preliminaries of any decision or action in the field of foreign politics.

<!-- It is just this circle which is beginning to-day to divert our foreign policy into most
disastrous directions and turn it away from the task of promoting the real interests of
the nation. 

Seeing that they do this in order to serve their own fantastic ideologies, I feel
myself obliged to take the greatest pains in laying before my own colleagues a clear
exposition of the most important problem in our foreign policy, namely, our position in
relation to Russia. 

I shall deal with it, as thoroughly as may be necessary to make it
generally understood and as far as the limits of this book permit. Let me begin by laying
down the following postulate: -->

<!-- When we speak of foreign politics we understand that domain of government which has set before it the task of managing the affairs of a nation in its relations with the rest of the world. Now the guiding principles which must be followed in managing these affairs must be based on the definite facts that are at hand. Moreover, as National Socialists, we must lay down the following axiom regarding the manner in which the
foreign policy of a People's State should be conducted: -->


Our foreign policy is to secure the existence of our race which is incorporated in this State.

This must be done by establishing a healthy and natural balance between:
- the number and growth of the population 
- the extent and resources of their territory

<!-- That balance must be such that it accords with the vital necessities of the people. -->

A HEALTHY proportion guarantees the support of a people by the resources of its own soil and sub-soil. 

Any situation which falls short of this condition is nonetheless unhealthy even though it may endure for centuries or even a thousand years. Sooner or later, this lack of proportion must lead to the decline or even annihilation of the people concerned.

**Only a sufficiently large space on this earth can assure the independent existence of a people.**

The extent of the territorial expansion that may be necessary for the settlement of the national population must not be estimated by present exigencies nor even by the magnitude of its agricultural productivity in relation to the number of the population.

In volume 1 of this book, under the heading "Germany's Policy of Alliances before the War," I have already explained that the geometrical dimensions of a State are of importance not only as the source of the nation's foodstuffs and raw materials, but also from the political and military standpoints. 

Once a people is assured of being able to maintain itself from the resources of the national territory, it must think of how this national territory can be defended. National security depends on the political strength of a State, and this strength, in its turn, depends on the military possibilities inherent in the geographical situation.

Thus the German nation could assure its own future only by being a World Power. 

For nearly 2,000 years, the defence of our national interests was a matter of world history.

For example, our gigantic struggle from 1914 to 1918 was known in history as the *World* War.*

{{< n n="It was a World War because it involved Britain, which had a worldwide empire, and the United States. It was not because of Germany. Previous wars with neither Britain nor the United States were not world wars, such as the Spanish-American war." >}}

When Germany entered this struggle, it was presumed that she was a World Power. I say PRESUMED, because in reality she was no such thing. 

In 1914, if there had been a different proportion between the German population and its territorial area, Germany would have been really a World Power and, if we leave other factors out of count, the War would have ended in our favour.

<!-- It is not my task nor my intention here to discuss what would have happened if certain
conditions had been fulfilled. But I feel it absolutely incumbent on me to show the
present conditions in their bare and unadorned reality, insisting on the weakness
inherent in them, so that at least in the ranks of the National Socialist Movement they
should receive the necessary recognition. -->

Germany is not at all a World Power today.

<!-- Our present military weakness could be overcome. But we still would have no claim to be called a World Power.

What importance on earth has a State in which the proportion between the size of the
population and the territorial area is so miserable as in the present German REICH? 

At an epoch in which the world is being gradually portioned out among States many of whom almost embrace whole continents one cannot speak of a World Power in the case of a State whose political motherland is confined to a territorial area of barely fivehundred-thousand square kilometres.

Looked at purely from the territorial point of view,  -->
