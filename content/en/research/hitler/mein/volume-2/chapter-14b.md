The area comprised in the German REICH is insignificant compared with the real World Powers. 

<!-- England must not be cited here as an example to contradict this statement; for  -->

The English motherland is the great metropolis of the British World Empire, which owns almost 1/4 of the earth's surface. 

Next to this are:
- the American Union as one of the foremost among the colossal States
- Russia
- China

These are enormous spaces, some of which are more than 10 times greater in territorial extent than the present German REICH.

France is also a colossal State because she is constantly adding to the strength of her army by recruiting coloured troops from her gigantic empire

France is racially becoming more and more negroid.
- France could actually create an African State on European soil. 
<!-- , so much so that now one can actually speak of the creation of -->

If France continues her path for the next 300 years, all traces of French blood will finally be submerged in the formation of a Euro-African Mulatto State. 

<!-- develops along the lines it has taken in our day, and should that development  -->

It would become a formidable and compact colonial territory stretching from the Rhine to the Congo, inhabited by an inferior race developed through a slow and steady process of bastardization.

<!-- That process distinguishes French colonial policy from the policy followed by the old Germany. -->

The contemporary colonial policy of France cannot be compared with that of Germany in the past. 

The former German colonial policy was carried out by half-measures, as was almost everything they did at that time. 

They did not gain an expanse of territory to settle German nationals. They did they attempt to reinforce the REICH's power through the enlistment of black troops, which would have been a criminal undertaking. 

The Askari in German East Africa represented a small and hesitant step along this road. But in reality, they served only for the defence of the colony itself. 

The idea of importing black troops to a European theatre of war was never entertained as a proposal to be carried out under favourable circumstances.

<!-- --apart entirely from the practical impossibility of this in the World War-- -->

On the contrary, the French always looked on such an idea as fundamental in their colonial activities.

Thus, many States are much more populous and have more political power than Germany 

The proportion between the territorial dimensions of the German REICH and the numerical size of its population was never so unfavourable in comparison with the other world States as at the beginning of our history 2,000 ago and again to-day. 


2,000 ago, were a young people. We stormed a decadent world made up of great States, of which Rome was the last giant that we overthrew. 

Today we find ourselves in a world of great and powerful States, among which the importance of our own REICH is constantly declining more and more. 

<!-- We must always face this bitter truth with clear and calm minds. We must study the area and population of the German REICH in relation to the other States and compare them down through the centuries. Then we shall find that, as I have said,  -->

Germany is not a World Power whether its military strength be great or not. 

There is no proportion between our position and that of the other States throughout the world.

This lack of proportion is because our foreign policy:
- never had a definite aim to attain
- lost every sound instinct for self-preservation.

If the historians who are to write our national history at some future date are to give the
National Socialist Movement the credit of having devoted itself to a sacred duty in the
service of our people, this movement will have to recognize the real truth of our
situation in regard to the rest of the world. 

However painful this recognition may be, the movement must draw courage from it and a sense of practical realities in fighting against the aimlessness and incompetence which has hitherto been shown by our
people in the conduct of their foreign policy. 

The movement must organize our national forces and set them on the path of territorial expansion, without:
- respect for 'tradition' and
- any preconceived notions.

<!-- restriction which is the bane of our national life to-day, and win new territory for them. -->

Thus the movement will save the German people from perishing or from being slaves of any other people.

Our movement must abolish the present disastrous proportion between our population and the area of our national territory, considering national territory as the source of our maintenance or as a basis of political power. 

It should strive to abolish the contrast between past history and the hopelessly powerless situation in
which we are to-day. 

In striving for this it must bear in mind the fact that we are members of the highest species of humanity on this earth, that we have a correspondingly high duty, and that we shall fulfil this duty only if we inspire the German people with the racial idea, so that they will occupy themselves not merely with the breeding of good dogs and horses and cats, but also care for the purity of their own blood.

The foreign policy hitherto followed by Germany has been without aim and ineffectual.

Were our people intellectually backward, or if they lacked courage, the final results of their efforts could not have been worse than what we see to-day. 

What happened during the last decades before the War does not permit of any illusions on this point; because we must not measure the strength of a State taken by itself, but in comparison with other States. 

This comparison shows that the other States increased their strength in such a measure that not only did it balance that of Germany but turned out in the end to be greater; so that, contrary to appearances, when compared with the other States Germany declined more and more in power until there was a large margin in her disfavour. 

Yes, even in the size of our population we remained far behind, and kept on losing ground. 

Though it is true that the courage of our people was not surpassed by that of any other in the world and that they poured  out more blood than any other nation in defence of their existence, their failure was due
only to the erroneous way in which that courage was turned to practical purposes.
