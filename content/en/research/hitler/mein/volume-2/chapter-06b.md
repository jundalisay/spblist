Outside of the small circles which I have mentioned, at that time I found no party engaged in explaining things to the people in this way. Not one of these parties was then active which talk to-day as if it was they who had brought about the change in public opinion.

If a political leader, calling himself a nationalist, pronounced a discourse somewhere or other on this theme it was only before circles which for the most part were already of his own conviction and among whom the most that was done was to confirm them in their opinions. 

But that was not what was needed then. What was needed was to win over through propaganda and explanation those whose opinions and mental attitudes held them bound to the enemy's camp.

The one-page circular was also adopted by us to help in this propaganda. While still a soldier I had written a circular in which I contrasted the Treaty of Brest-Litowsk with that of Versailles. That circular was printed and distributed in large numbers. 

Later on I used it for the party, and also with good success. Our first meetings were distinguished by the fact that there were tables covered with leaflets, papers, and pamphlets of every kind. 

But we relied principally on the spoken word. And, in fact, this is the only means capable of producing really great revolutions, which can be explained on general psychological grounds.

In the first volume I have already stated that all the formidable events which have changed the aspect of the world were carried through, not by the written but by the spoken word. On that point there was a long discussion in a certain section of the Press during the course of which our shrewd bourgeois people strongly opposed my thesis. 

But the reason for this attitude confounded the sceptics. The bourgeois intellectuals protested against my attitude simply because they themselves did not have the force or ability to influence the masses through the spoken word; for they always relied exclusively on the help of writers and did not enter the arena themselves as orators for the purpose of arousing the people.

The development of events necessarily led to that condition of affairs which is characteristic of the bourgeoisie to-day, namely, the loss of the psychological instinct to act upon and influence the masses. 

An orator receives continuous guidance from the people before whom he speaks. This
helps him to correct the direction of his speech; for he can always gauge, by the faces of
his hearers, how far they follow and understand him, and whether his words are
producing the desired effect. But the writer does not know his reader at all. 

Therefore, from the outset he does not address himself to a definite human group of persons which
he has before his eyes but must write in a general way. Hence, up to a certain extent he
must fail in psychological finesse and flexibility. Therefore, in general it may be said
that a brilliant orator writes better than a brilliant writer can speak, unless the latter has
continual practice in public speaking. One must also remember that of itself the
multitude is mentally inert, that it remains attached to its old habits and that it is not
naturally prone to read something which does not conform with its own pre-established
beliefs when such writing does not contain what the multitude hopes to find there.

Therefore, some piece of writing which has a particular tendency is for the most part
read only by those who are in sympathy with it. Only a leaflet or a placard, on account
of its brevity, can hope to arouse a momentary interest in those whose opinions differ
from it. The picture, in all its forms, including the film, has better prospects. Here there
is less need of elaborating the appeal to the intelligence. It is sufficient if one be careful
to have quite short texts, because many people are more ready to accept a pictorial
presentation than to read a long written description. In a much shorter time, at one
stroke I might say, people will understand a pictorial presentation of something which
it would take them a long and laborious effort of reading to understand.

The most important consideration, however, is that one never knows into what hands a
piece of written material comes and yet the form in which its subject is presented must
remain the same. In general the effect is greater when the form of treatment
corresponds to the mental level of the reader and suits his nature. Therefore, a book
which is meant for the broad masses of the people must try from the very start to gain
its effects through a style and level of ideas which would be quite different from a book
intended to be read by the higher intellectual classes.

Only through his capacity for adaptability does the force of the written word approach
that of oral speech. The orator may deal with the same subject as a book deals with; but
if he has the genius of a great and popular orator he will scarcely ever repeat the same
argument or the same material in the same form on two consecutive occasions. He will
always follow the lead of the great mass in such a way that from the living emotion of
his hearers the apt word which he needs will be suggested to him and in its turn this
will go straight to the hearts of his hearers. 

Should he make even a slight mistake he has the living correction before him. As I have already said, he can read the play of expression on the faces of his hearers

1.  to see if they understand what he says,
2. to see if they take in the whole of his argument,
3. how far they are convinced of the justice of what has been placed before them. 

Should he observe, 

1. his hearers do not understand him he will make his explanation so elementary 
and clear that they will be able to grasp it, even to the last individual. 
2. if he feels that they are not capable of following him he will make one idea follow another
carefully and slowly until the most slow-witted hearer no longer lags behind.
3. As soon as he has the feeling that they do not seem convinced that he is right in the way he has put things to them he will repeat his argument over and over again, always giving fresh illustrations, and he himself will state their unspoken objection. 

He will repeat these objections, dissecting them and refuting them, until the last group of the
opposition show him by their behaviour and play of expression that they have
capitulated before his exposition of the case.

Not infrequently it is a case of overcoming ingrained prejudices which are mostly
unconscious and are supported by sentiment rather than reason. It is a thousand times
more difficult to overcome this barrier of instinctive aversion, emotional hatred and
preventive dissent than to correct opinions which are founded on defective or
erroneous knowledge.

False ideas and ignorance may be set aside by means of
instruction, but emotional resistance never can. Nothing but an appeal to these hidden
forces will be effective here. And that appeal can be made by scarcely any writer. Only
the orator can hope to make it.

A very striking proof of this is found in the fact that, though we had a bourgeois Press
which in many cases was well written and produced and had a circulation of millions
among the people, it could not prevent the broad masses from becoming the implacable
enemies of the bourgeois class. The deluge of papers and books published by the
intellectual circles year after year passed over the millions of the lower social strata like
water over glazed leather. This proves that one of two things must be true: either that
the matter offered in the bourgeois Press was worthless or that it is impossible to reach
the hearts of the broad masses by means of the written word alone. Of course, the latter
would be specially true where the written material shows such little psychological
insight as has hitherto been the case.

It is useless to object here, as certain big Berlin papers of German-National tendencies
have attempted to do, that this statement is refuted by the fact that the Marxists have
exercised their greatest influence through their writings, and especially through their
principal book, published by Karl Marx. 

Seldom has a more superficial argument been
based on a false assumption. What gave Marxism its amazing influence over the broad
masses was not that formal printed work which sets forth the Jewish system of ideas,
but the tremendous oral propaganda carried on for years among the masses. Out of one
hundred thousand German workers scarcely one hundred know of Marx's book. It has
been studied much more in intellectual circles and especially by the Jews than by the
genuine followers of the movement who come from the lower classes. 

That work was not written for the masses, but exclusively for the intellectual leaders of the Jewish
machine for conquering the world. The engine was heated with quite different stuff:
namely, the journalistic Press. What differentiates the bourgeois Press from the Marxist 
Press is that the latter is written by agitators, whereas the bourgeois Press would like to
carry on agitation by means of professional writers. The Social-Democrat sub-editor,
who almost always came directly from the meeting to the editorial offices of his paper,
felt his job on his finger-tips. But the bourgeois writer who left his desk to appear before
the masses already felt ill when he smelled the very odour of the crowd and found that
what he had written was useless to him.
