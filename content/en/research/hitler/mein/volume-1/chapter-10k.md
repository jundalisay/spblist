Their worst crime was to victimize the Army. 

<!-- But still the country might have been able to bear with all this provided the halfmeasure policy had not victimized that force in which, as the last resort, the existence of the Empire depended: namely, the Army.

The crime committed by the so-called German Reichstag in this regard was sufficient of itself to draw down upon it the curses of the German Nation for all time. 

On the most miserable of pretexts these parliamentary party henchmen filched from the hands of the nation and -->

The parliament threw away the weapons which were needed to defend the liberty of our people. 

<!-- If the graves on the plains of Flanders were to open to-day the bloodstained accusers would arise, hundreds of thousands of our best German youth who were driven into the arms of death by those conscienceless parliamentary ruffians who were either wrongly educated for their task
or only half-educated. 

Those youths, and other millions of the killed and mutilated, were lost to the Fatherland simply and solely in order that a few hundred deceivers of the people might carry out their political manoeuvres and their exactions or even treasonably pursue their doctrinaire theories. -->

Through the Marxist and democratic Press, the Jews spread the colossal falsehood about 'German Militarism' throughout the world.

They tried to inculpate Germany by every possible means. At the same time, the Marxist and democratic parties refused to give adequate training to our national defence forces.

<!-- The appalling crime thus committed by these people ought to have been obvious to everybody who foresaw that in case of war the whole nation
would have to be called to arms and that, because of the mean huckstering of these noble 'representatives of the people', as they called themselves, millions of Germans would have to face the enemy ill-equipped and insufficiently trained.  -->

<!-- But even apart from the consequences of the crude and brutal lack of conscience which these parliamentarian rascals displayed, it was quite clear that  -->

The lack of properly trained soldiers at the start of a war leads to the loss of such a war.

<!-- and this probability was confirmed in a most terrible way during the course of the
world war. -->

<!-- Therefore the German people lost the struggle for the freedom and independence of their country because of the half-hearted and defective policy employed during times of peace in the organization and training of the defensive strength of the nation. -->

The number of recruits trained for the land forces was too small.

 <!-- but the same halfheartedness was shown in regard to the navy and made this weapon of national selfpreservation more or less ineffective.  -->

Unfortunately, even the naval authorities themselves were contaminated with this spirit of half-heartedness. 

This lack of foresight and geniuus was obvious in them building ships somewhat smaller than those just launched by the British.

A fleet which cannot be made as large as that of the probable enemy should compensate by the superior fighting power of each ship. 

It is the weight of the fighting power that counts and not any sort of traditional quality. As a matter of fact, 

Modern technical development is so advanced and so well proportioned among the civilized States. It is practically impossible for one
Power to build vessels which would have a superior fighting quality. 

But smaller vessels will hardly be superior in action to larger ones.

The smaller German vessels have less speed and armament. 

<!-- The phrase used to justify this policy was in itself an evidence of the lack of logical thinking on the part of the naval authorities
who were in charge of these matters in times of peace.  -->

The Navy declared that the German guns were superior to the British 30.5 cm in terms of striking efficiency.

But that means they should have built more 30.5 cm. guns.

<!-- also; for it ought to have been their object not to achieve equality but superiority in
fighting strength.  -->

<!-- If that were not so then it would have been superfluous to equip the land forces with 42 cm. mortars; for the German 21 cm. mortar could be far superior to any high-angle guns which the French possessed at that time and since the fortresses could probably have been taken by means of 30.5 cm. mortars. 

The army authorities unfortunately failed to do so. 

If they refrained from assuring superior efficiency in the artillery as in the velocity, this was because of the fundamentally false 'principle of risk' which they adopted.  -->

The naval authorities in peacetime renounced the principle of attack. Thus they had to follow a defensive policy from the start of
the War. 

<!-- But by this attitude they renounced also the chances of final success, which can
be achieved only by an offensive policy. -->

A vessel with slower speed and weaker armament will be crippled by an adversary that is faster, stronger, and can frequently shoot from a favourable distance. 

A large number of cruisers have been through bitter experiences in this matter.

<!-- How wrong were the ideas prevalent among the naval authorities in times of peace was
proved during the War. They were compelled to modify the armament of the old
vessels and to equip the new ones with better armament whenever there was a chance
to do so.  -->

If the German vessels in the Battle of the Skagerrak had been of equal size, the same armament and same speed as the English, the British Fleet would have gone down under the tempest of the German 38 centimeter shells.
- These hit their aims more accurately and effectively.

Japan had followed a different kind of naval policy.

They created every single new vessel with a fighting force that would be superior to those of the eventual adversaries.
- This allowed their fleet to be used for the offensive.

<!-- While the army authorities refused to adopt such fundamentally erroneous principles,
the navy--which unfortunately had more representatives in Parliament--succumbed to
the spirit that ruled there. The navy was not organized on a strong basis, and it was
later used in an unsystematic and irresolute way. The immortal glory which the navy
won, in spite of these drawbacks, must be entirely credited to the good work and the
efficiency and incomparable heroism of officers and crews. If the former commandersin-chief had been inspired with the same kind of genius all the sacrifices would not
have been in vain.

It was probably the very parliamentarian skill displayed by the chief of the navy during
the years of peace which later became the cause of the fatal collapse, since
parliamentarian considerations had begun to play a more important role in the
construction of the navy than fighting considerations. The irresolution, the weakness
and the failure to adopt a logically consistent policy, which is typical of the
parliamentary system, contaminated the naval authorities.

As I have already emphasized, the military authorities did not allow themselves to be
led astray by such fundamentally erroneous ideas.  -->

Ludendorff was then a Colonel in the General Staff. He led a desperate struggle against the Reichstag's policies and in most cases voted against them. 

He was unsuccessful because of:
- the Parliament and
- Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg

<!-- If the fight which this officer then waged remained unsuccessful
this must be debited to the Parliament and partly also to the wretched and weak
attitude of the Chancellor, .

Yet those who are responsible for Germany's collapse do not hesitate now to lay all the
blame on the shoulders of the one man who took a firm stand against the neglectful
manner in which the interests of the nation were managed. But one falsehood more or
less makes no difference to these congenital tricksters.

Anybody who thinks of all the sacrifices which this nation has had to bear, as a result of
the criminal neglect of those irresponsible individuals; anybody who thinks of the
number of those who died or were maimed unnecessarily; anybody who thinks of the
deplorable shame and dishonour which has been heaped upon us and of the illimitable
distress into which our people are now plunged--anybody who realizes that in order to
prepare the way to a few seats in Parliament for some unscrupulous place-hunters and
arrivists will understand that such hirelings can be called by no other name than that of
rascal and criminal; for otherwise those words could have no meaning. In comparison
with traitors who betrayed the nation's trust every other kind of twister may be looked
upon as an honourable man.

It was a peculiar feature of the situation that all the real faults of the old Germany were
exposed to the public gaze only when the inner solidarity of the nation could be injured
by doing so. Then, indeed, unpleasant truths were openly proclaimed in the ears of the
broad masses, while many other things were at other times shamefully hushed up or
their existence simply denied, especially at times when an open discussion of such
problems might have led to an improvement in their regard. The higher government
authorities knew little or nothing of the nature and use of propaganda in such matters. -->

Only the Jew knew that by an able and persistent use of propaganda heaven itself can be presented to the people as if it were hell and, vice versa, the most miserable kind of life can be presented as if it were paradise. 

The Jew knew this and acted accordingly.

But the German, or rather his Government, did not have the slightest suspicion of it.

<!-- During the War the heaviest of penalties had to be paid for that ignorance.

Over against the innumerable drawbacks which I have mentioned here and which affected German life before the War there were many outstanding features on the positive side. 

If we take an impartial survey we must admit that most of our drawbacks were in great measure prevalent also in other countries and among the other nations, and very often in a worse form than with us; whereas among us there were many real advantages which the other did not have. 

The leading phase of Germany's superiority arose from the fact that, almost alone among all the other European nations, the German nation had made the strongest effort to preserve the national character of its economic structure and for this reason was less subject than other countries to the power of international finance, though indeed there were many untoward symptoms in this regard also.

And yet this superiority was a perilous one and turned out later to be one of the chief causes of the world war. -->
