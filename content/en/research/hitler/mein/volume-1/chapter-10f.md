Prostitution is a disgrace to humanity. It cannot be removed simply by charitable or academic methods.

The first remedy is to establish conditions that will make early marriages possible, especially for young men--for women are, after all, only passive subjects in this matter.

Thus, the first preliminary condition is for the young generation to be afforded facilities for contracting early marriages. 

**Late marriages are and will remain a disgrace to humanity.**


<!-- Its restriction and final extermination presupposes the removal of a whole series of contributory circumstances.  -->

<!-- An illustration of the extent to which people have so often been led astray nowadays is
afforded by the fact that not infrequently one hears mothers in so-called 'better' circles
openly expressing their satisfaction at having found as a -->

Parents prefer for their daughter a husband who has already sown his wild oats, etc. 

There are many men of this type. The poor girl finds no difficulty in getting this kind of mate. The children of this marriage are a visible result of such supposedly sensible unions.

<!-- When one realizes, apart from this, that every possible effort is being made to hinder the process of procreation and that Nature is being wilfully cheated of her rights, there remains really only one question: Why is such an institution as marriage still in
existence, and what are its functions? 

Is it really nothing better than prostitution? Does our duty to posterity no longer play any part? Or do people not realize the nature of the
curse they are inflicting on themselves and their offspring by such criminally foolish
neglect of one of the primary laws of Nature? 
This is how civilized nations degenerate
and gradually perish. -->

Marriage must serve the greater end -- increasing and maintaining the human species and the race. This is its only meaning and purpose.

<!-- This being admitted, then it is clear that the institution of marriage must be judged by the manner in which its allotted function is fulfilled.  -->

Therefore early marriages should be the rule, because thus the young couple will still have that pristine force which is the fountain head of a healthy posterity with unimpaired powers of resistance. 

Early marriages require a whole series of social measures to be first undertaken.

<!--  without which early marriages cannot be even thought of. In other words, a solution of this question, which seems a small problem in itself, cannot be
brought about without adopting radical measures to alter the social background. The
importance of such measures ought to be studied and properly estimated, especially at
a time when the so-called  -->

1. Housing and Family Support

Our current 'social' Republic has been unable to solve the housing problem. This has made it impossible for innumerable couples to get married. 

This then allows the further advance of prostitution.

Another reason is that salaries do not include family support. 

<!-- Prostitution, therefore, can only be really seriously tackled if, by means
of a radical social reform, early marriage is made easier than hitherto. This is the first
preliminary necessity for the solution of this problem. -->

2. Educatioon on Child-rearing

<!-- Secondly, a whole series of false notions must be eradicated from our system of
bringing up and educating children--things which hitherto no one seems to have
worried about. In our present educational system a balance will have to be established,
first and foremost, -->

The educational system must create a balance between mental instruction and physical training.

What is known as GYMNASIUM (Grammar School) to-day is a positive insult to the Greek institution. 

Our system of education entirely loses sight of the fact that in the long run a healthy mind can exist only in a healthy body.

<!-- This statement, with few exceptions, applies particularly to the broad masses of the nation. -->

In the pre-War Germany, the training of the body was criminally neglected, the one-sided training of the mind being regarded as a sufficient guarantee for the nation's greatness. 

This mistake allows the Bolshevic teaching to flourish in those regions whose degenerate population has been brought to the verge of starvation:
- Central Germany
- Saxony
- the Ruhr Valley. 

In all these districts there is a marked absence of any serious resistance, even by the so-called intellectual classes, against this Jewish
contagion. 

This is because the intellectual classes are themselves are physically degenerate, not through privation but through education. 

<!-- The exclusive
intellectualism of the education in vogue among our upper classes makes them unfit for
life's struggle at an epoch in which physical force and not mind is the dominating
factor. Thus they are neither capable of maintaining themselves nor of making their
way in life. In nearly every case physical disability is the forerunner of personal
cowardice. -->

<!-- The extravagant emphasis laid on purely intellectual education and the consequent
neglect of physical training must necessarily lead to sexual thoughts in early youth.
Those boys whose constitutions have been trained and hardened by sports and
gymnastics are less prone to sexual indulgence than those stay-at-homes who have been
fed exclusively with mental pabulum. Sound methods of education cannot, however,
afford to disregard this, and we must not forget that the expectations of a healthy young
man from a woman will differ from those of a weakling who has been prematurely
corrupted. -->

Our curriculum must be arranged so as to occupy a boy's free time in profitable development of his physical powers. 

He has no right in those years to loaf about, becoming a nuisance in public streets and in cinemas. But when his day's work is done he ought to harden his young body so that his strength may not be found wanting when the occasion arises. 

To prepare for this and to carry it out should be the function of our educational system and not exclusively to pump in knowledge or wisdom. 

Our school system must also rid itself of the notion that the training of the body is a task that should be left to the individual himself. There is no such thing as allowing freedom of choice to sin against posterity and thus against the race.

The fight against pollution of the mind must be waged simultaneously with the training of the body. To-day the whole of our public life may be compared to a hot-house for the forced growth of sexual notions and incitements. 

A glance at the bill-of-fare provided by our cinemas, playhouses, and theatres suffices to prove that this is not the right food,
especially for our young people. 

Hoardings and advertisements kiosks combine to attract the public in the most vulgar manner. Anyone who has not altogether lost
contact with adolescent yearnings will realize that all this must have very grave
consequences. 

This seductive and sensuous atmosphere puts notions into the heads of our youth which, at their age, ought still to be unknown to them. Unfortunately, the results of this kind of education can best be seen in our contemporary youth who are prematurely grown up and therefore old before their time. 

The law courts from time to time throw a distressing light on the spiritual life of our 14- and 15-year old children.

Who, therefore, will be surprised to learn that venereal disease claims its victims at this age? And is it not a frightful shame to see the number of physically weak and intellectually spoiled young men who have been introduced to the mysteries of marriage by the whores of the big cities?

No; those who want seriously to combat prostitution must first of all assist in removing the spiritual conditions on which it thrives. They will have to clean up the moral pollution of our city 'culture' fearlessly and without regard for the outcry that will follow. 

If we do not drag our youth out of the morass of their present environment they will be engulfed by it. Those people who do not want to see these things are deliberately encouraging them and are guilty of spreading the effects of prostitution to the future--for the future belongs to our young generation. 

This process of cleansing our 'Kultur' will have to be applied in practically all spheres. The stage, art, literature, the cinema, the Press and advertisement posters, all must have the stains of pollution removed and be placed in the service of a national and cultural idea. 

The life of the people must be freed from the asphyxiating perfume of our modern eroticism and also from every unmanly and prudish form of insincerity. In all these things the aim and the method must be determined by thoughtful consideration for the preservation of our
national well-being in body and soul. 

The right to personal freedom comes second in importance to the duty of maintaining the race.

Only after such measures have been put into practice can a medical campaign against this scourge begin with some hope of success. But, here again, half-measures will be valueless. 

Far-reaching and important decisions will have to be made. It would be doing things by halves if incurables were given the opportunity of infecting one healthy person after another. 

This would be that kind of humanitarianism which would allow hundreds to perish in order to save the suffering of one individual. The demand that it should be made impossible for defective people to continue to propagate defective offspring is a demand that is based on most reasonable grounds, and its proper fulfilment is the most humane task that mankind has to face. 

Unhappy and undeserved suffering in millions of cases will be spared, with the result that there will be a gradual improvement in national health. 

A determined decision to act in this manner will at the same time provide an obstacle against the further spread of venereal disease. It would
then be a case, where necessary, of mercilessly isolating all incurables--perhaps a barbaric measure for those unfortunates--but a blessing for the present generation and for posterity. 

The temporary pain thus experienced in this century can and will spare future thousands of generations from suffering.

The fight against syphilis and its pace-maker, prostitution, is one of the gigantic tasks of mankind; gigantic, because it is not merely a case of solving a single problem but the removal of a whole series of evils which are the contributory causes of this scourge. 

Disease of the body in this case is merely the result of a diseased condition of the moral, social, and racial instincts.

But if for reasons of indolence or cowardice this fight is not fought to a finish we may imagine what conditions will be like 500 years hence. Little of God's image will be left in human nature, except to mock the Creator.

But what has been done in Germany to counteract this scourge? If we think calmly over the answer we shall find it distressing. It is true that in governmental circles the terrible and injurious effects of this disease were well known, but the counter-measures which were officially adopted were ineffective and a hopeless failure. 

They tinkered with cures for the symptoms, wholly regardless of the cause of the disease. Prostitutes were medically examined and controlled as far as possible, and when signs of infection were apparent they were sent to hospital. When outwardly cured, they were once more let
loose on humanity.

It is true that 'protective legislation' was introduced which made sexual intercourse a punishable offence for all those not completely cured, or those suffering from venereal disease. 

This legislation was correct in theory, but in practice it failed completely. In the first place, in the majority of cases women will decline to appear in court as witnesses against men who have robbed them of their health. Women would be exposed far more than men to uncharitable remarks in such cases, and one can imagine what their position would be if they had been infected by their own husbands. Should women in
that case lay a charge? Or what should they do?

In the case of the man there is the additional fact that he frequently is unfortunate enough to run up against this danger when he is under the influence of alcohol. His condition makes it impossible for him to assess the qualities of his 'amorous beauty,' a fact which is well known to every diseased prostitute and makes them single out men in this ideal condition for preference. 

The result is that the unfortunate man is not able to recollect later on who his compassionate benefactress was, which is not surprising in cities like Berlin and Munich. Many of such cases are visitors from the provinces who, held speechless and enthralled by the magic charm of city life, become an easy prey for prostitutes.

<!-- In the final analysis who is able to say whether he has been infected or not?
Are there not innumerable cases on record where an apparently cured person has a
relapse and does untold harm without knowing it?
Therefore in practice the results of these legislative measures are negative. The same
applies to the control of prostitution, and, finally, even medical treatment and cure are
nowadays unsafe and doubtful. One thing only is certain. The scourge has spread 
further and further in spite of all measures, and this alone suffices definitely to stamp
and substantiate their inefficiency. -->

<!-- Everything else that was undertaken was just as inefficient as it was absurd. The
spiritual prostitution of the people was neither arrested nor was anything whatsoever
undertaken in this direction.
Those, however, who do not regard this subject as a serious one would do well to
examine the statistical data of the spread of this disease, study its growth in the last
century and contemplate the possibilities of its further development. The ordinary
observer, unless he were particularly stupid, would experience a cold shudder if the
position were made clear to him.

The half-hearted and wavering attitude adopted in pre-War Germany towards this
iniquitous condition can assuredly be taken as a visible sign of national decay. When
the courage to fight for one's own health is no longer in evidence, then the right to live
in this world of struggle also ceases. -->
