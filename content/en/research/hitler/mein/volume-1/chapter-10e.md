<!-- A further example of the weak and hesitating way in which vital national problems were dealt with in pre-War Germany is the following: Hand in hand with the political and moral process of infecting the nation,  -->

For many years, together with the political and moral disease infecting the nation, syphilis had been attacking the public health of the people. 

In large cities, particularly, it steadily increased and tuberculosis kept pace with it in reaping its harvest of death almost in every part of the country.

<!-- Although in both cases the effect on the nation was alarming, it seemed as if nobody was in a position to undertake any decisive measures against these scourges. -->

In the case of syphilis especially, the State's attitude was of absolute capitulation.

<!-- To combat this state of affairs something of far wider sweep should have been undertaken than was really done. The discovery of a remedy which is of a questionable nature and the excellent way in which it was placed on the market were only of little assistance in fighting such a scourge.  -->

Our solution is to attack the disease in its causes rather than in its symptoms. 

**The primary cause is how love has been prostituted.** 

Even though this did not directly bring about the fearful disease itself, the nation must still suffer serious damage thereby, for t

The moral havoc resulting from this prostitution can destroy the nation, slowly but surely. 

This Judaizing of our spiritual life and mammonizing of our natural instinct for procreation will sooner or later work havoc with our whole posterity. 

<!-- For instead of strong, healthy children, blessed with natural feelings, we shall see miserable specimens of humanity resulting from economic calculation. 

For economic considerations are becoming more and more the foundations of marriage and the sole preliminary condition of it. And
love looks for an outlet elsewhere.

Here, as elsewhere, one may defy Nature for a certain period of time; but sooner or later she will take her inexorable revenge. 

And when man realizes this truth it is often too late.

Our own nobility furnishes an example of the devastating consequences that follow from a persistent refusal to recognize the primary conditions necessary for normal wedlock.  -->

These Jewish reproductive habits are caused by:
- social pressure and
  - This leads to inherited debility.
- financial considerations. 
  - This leads to adulteration of the blood-strain.

This is because all the Jewish daughters of the department store owners are looked upon as eligible mates to co-operate in propagating His
Lordship's stock. And the stock certainly looks it. 

All this leads to absolute degeneration. Nowadays our bourgeoise are making efforts to follow in the same path.

<!-- They will come to the same journey's end. -->

<!-- These unpleasant truths are hastily and nonchalantly brushed aside, as if by so doing the real state of affairs could also be abolished. But no. It cannot be denied that the population of our great towns and cities is tending more and more to avail of prostitution in the exercise of its amorous instincts and is thus becoming more and more contaminated by the scourge of venereal disease. 

On the one hand, the visible effects of this mass-infection can be observed in our insane asylums and, on the other hand, alas! among the children at home. These are the doleful and tragic witnesses to the steadily increasing scourge that is poisoning our sexual life. Their sufferings are the visible results of parental vice. -->

There are many ways of becoming resigned to this unpleasant and terrible fact. Many people go about seeing nothing or, to be more correct, not wanting to see anything. 

This is by far the simplest and cheapest attitude to adopt. 

<!-- Others cover themselves in the sacred mantle of prudery, as ridiculous as it is false. They describe the whole condition of affairs as sinful and are profoundly indignant when brought face to face with a
victim. 

They close their eyes in reverend abhorrence to this godless scourge and pray to the Almighty that He--if possible after their own death--may rain down fire and brimstone as on Sodom and Gomorrah and so once again make an out standing example of this shameless section of humanity. Finally, there are those who are well aware of the terrible results which this scourge will and must bring about, but they
merely shrug their shoulders, fully convinced of their inability to undertake anything
against this peril. Hence matters are allowed to take their own course.

Undoubtedly all this is very convenient and simple, only it must not be overlooked that this convenient way of approaching things can have fatal consequences for our national life. 

The excuse that other nations are also not faring any better does not alter the fact of our own deterioration, except that the feeling of sympathy for other stricken nations makes our own suffering easier to bear. But the important question that arises here is:
Which nation will be the first to take the initiative in mastering this scourge, and which
nations will succumb to it?  -->

This will be the final upshot of the whole situation. The present is a period of probation for racial values. 

The race that fails to come through the test will simply die out and its place will be taken by the healthier and stronger races, which will be able to endure greater hardships. 

This problem primarily concerns posterity, it belongs to that category of which it is said with terrible justification that the
sins of the fathers are visited on their offspring unto the tenth generation. 

This is a consequence which follows on an infringement of the laws of blood and race. 

<!-- The sin against blood and race is the hereditary sin in this world and it brings disaster on every nation that commits it.

The attitude towards this one vital problem in pre-War Germany was most regrettable.

What measures were undertaken to arrest the infection of our youth in the large cities? -->

What was done to put an end to the contamination and mammonization of sexual life among us? 

What was done to fight the resultant spreading of syphilis throughout the whole of our national life? 

<!-- The reply to this question can best be illustrated by showing what should have been done. -->

<!-- Instead of tackling this problem in a haphazard way, the authorities should have realized that the fortunes or misfortunes of future generations depended on its solution.

But to admit this would have demanded that active measures be carried out in a ruthless manner. 

The primary condition would have been that the enlightened attention of  -->

The whole country should have been alerted on this terrible danger, so that every individual would realize the importance of fighting against it.

It would be futile to impose obligations of a definite character--which are often difficult to bear--and expect them to become generally effective, unless the public be thoroughly instructed on the necessity of imposing and accepting such obligations. 

This demands a widespread and systematic method of enlightenment and all other daily problems that might distract public attention from this great central problem should be relegated to the background.

<!-- In every case where there are exigencies or tasks that seem impossible to deal with successfully public opinion must be concentrated on the one problem, under the conviction that the solution of this problem alone is a matter of life or death. 

Only in this way can public interest be aroused to such a pitch as will urge people to combine in a great voluntary effort and achieve important results.

This fundamental truth applies also to the individual, provided he is desirous of attaining some great end. He must always concentrate his efforts to one definitely limited stage of his progress which has to be completed before the next step be attempted. 

Those who do not endeavour to realize their aims step by step and who do not concentrate their energy in reaching the individual stages, will never attain the final objective. 

At some stage or other they will falter and fail. This systematic way of approaching an objective is an art in itself, and always calls for the expenditure of every ounce of energy in order to conquer step after step of the road.

Therefore the most essential preliminary condition necessary for an attack on such a difficult stage of the human road is that the authorities should succeed in convincing the masses that the immediate objective which is now being fought for is the only one that deserves to be considered and the only one on which everything depends. 

The broad masses are never able clearly to see the whole stretch of the road lying in front of them without becoming tired and thus losing faith in their ability to complete the task.  

To a certain extent they will keep the objective in mind, but they are only able to survey the whole road in small stages, as in the case of the traveller who knows where his journey is going to end but who masters the endless stretch far better by attacking it in degrees. 

Only in this way can he keep up his determination to reach the final objective. 

It is in this way, with the assistance of every form of propaganda, that the problem of fighting venereal disease should be placed before the public--not as a task for the nation but as THE main task. 

Every possible means should be employed to bring the truth about this scourge home to the minds of the people, until the whole nation has been
convinced that everything depends on the solution of this problem; that is to say, a healthy future or national decay.

Only after such preparatory measures--if necessary spread over a period of many years--will public attention and public resolution be fully aroused, and only then can serious and definite measures be undertaken without running the risk of not being fully understood or of being suddenly faced with a slackening of the public will. 

It must be made clear to all that a serious fight against this scourge calls for vast sacrifices and an enormous amount of work. -->

To wage war against syphilis means fighting against:
- prostitution
- prejudice
- old-established customs
- current fashion
- public opinion
- false prudery in certain circles.
