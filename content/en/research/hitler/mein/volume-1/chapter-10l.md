Germany's excellence lay in its:
- economic strength
- social and political life in 3 spheres

<!-- But even if we disregard this advantage of national independence in  matters there were certain other positive features of our  which were of outstanding excellence. 

These features were represented by three institutions which were constant sources of regeneration. In their respective spheres they were models of perfection and were partly unrivalled. -->

1. The statal Monarchial form developed for Germany in modern times.

This excludes those failing monarchs. 

<!--  who, as human beings, were subject to the failings which afflict this life and its children.
If we were not so tolerant in these matters, then the case of the present generation
would be hopeless; for if we take into consideration the personal capabilities and
character of the representative figures in our present regime it would be difficult to
imagine a more modest level of intelligence and moral character. If we measure the
'value' of the German Revolution by the personal worth and calibre of the individuals
whom this revolution has presented to the German people since November 1918 then
we may feel ashamed indeed in thinking of the judgment which posterity will pass on
these people, when the Law for the Protection of the Republic can no longer silence
public opinion. Coming generations will surely decide that the intelligence and
integrity of our new German leaders were in adverse ratio to their boasting and their
vices. -->

The monarchy had become alien in spirit to many citizens and especially the broad masses. 

This happens when the monarchs are not always surrounded by the highest intelligence or by persons of the most upright character.

Unfortunately, many of them preferred flatterers to honest-spoken men and hence received their 'information' from the former. 

<!-- This was
a source of grave danger at a time when the world was passing through a period in
which many of the old conditions were changing and when this change was affecting
even the traditions of the Court.

The average man or woman could not have felt a wave of enthusiasm surging within
the breast when, for example, at the turn of the century, a princess in uniform and on
horseback had the soldiers file past her on parade. Those high circles had apparently no
idea of the impression which such a parade made on the minds of ordinary people; else 
such unfortunate occurrences would not have taken place. The sentimental
humanitarianism--not always very sincere--which was professed in those high circles
was often more repulsive than attractive. When, for instance, the Princess X
condescended to taste the products of a soup kitchen and found them excellent, as
usual, such a gesture might have made an excellent impression in times long past, but
on this occasion it had the opposite effect to what was intended. For even if we take it
for granted that Her Highness did not have the slightest idea, that on the day she
sampled it, the food was not quite the same as on other days, it sufficed that the people
knew it. Even the best of intentions thus became an object of ridicule or a cause of
exasperation.

Descriptions of the proverbial frugality practised by the monarch, his much too early
rise in the morning and the drudgery he had to go through all day long until late at
night, and especially the constantly expressed fears lest he might become
undernourished--all this gave rise to ominous expression on the part of the people.
Nobody was keen to know what and how much the monarch ate or drank. Nobody
grudged him a full meal, or the necessary amount of sleep. Everybody was pleased
when the monarch, as a man and a personality, brought honour on his family and his
country and fulfilled his duties as a sovereign. All the legends which were circulated
about him helped little and did much damage.

These and such things, however, are only mere bagatelle. What was much worse was
the feeling, which spread throughout large sections of the nation, that the affairs of the
individual were being taken care of from above and that he did not need to bother
himself with them. As long as the Government was really good, or at least moved by
goodwill, no serious objections could be raised. -->

The country was destined to disaster when the old Government, which had at least striven for the best, became replaced by a new regime which was not of the same quality. 

<!-- Then the docile obedience and infantile credulity which formerly offered no resistance was bound to be one of the most fatal evils that can be imagined.  -->

But against these and other defects, there were certain qualities which had a positive effect.

The monarchical form of government:
- guarantees stability in the direction of public affairs
- safeguards public offices from the speculative turmoil of ambitious politicians
- arouses a feeling which gives weight to the monarchical authority
- raises the whole corps of officials, and the army in particular above the level of political party obligations
- puts the supreme rulership of the State in the monarch, as an individual person
  - The proverbial honesty and integrity of the German administration must be attributed chiefly to this fact.
<!-- who could serve as the symbol of responsibility, which a monarch has to bear more 
seriously than any anonymous parliamentary majority. Indeed,  -->
- fulfilled a high cultural function among the German people, which made amends for many of its defects. 

The German residential cities have remained, even to our time, centres of that artistic spirit which now threatens to disappear and is becoming more and more materialistic. 

The German princes gave a great deal of excellent and practical encouragement to art and science, especially during the 19th century. Our present age certainly has nothing of equal worth.


<!-- During that process of disintegration which was slowly extending throughout the social order the most positive force of resistance was that offered by the army. This was the strongest source of education which the German people possessed. For that reason all the hatred of our enemies was directed against the paladin of our national selfpreservation and our liberty. The strongest testimony in favour of this unique institution is the fact that it was derided, hated and fought against, but also feared, by worthless elements all round. The fact that the international profiteers who gathered at Versailles, further to exploit and plunder the nations directed their enmity specially against the old German army proved once again that it deserved to be regarded as the institution which protected the liberties of our people against the forces of the international stock-exchange. If the army had not been there to sound the alarm and stand on guard, the purposes of the Versailles representatives would have been carried out much sooner. There is only one word to express what the German people owe to this army--Everything! -->


2. The Army 

<!-- It was the army that still inculcated a sense of responsibility among the people when this quality had become very rare and when the habit of shirking every kind of responsibility was steadily spreading. This habit had grown up under the evil influences of Parliament, which was itself the very model of irresponsibility.  -->

The army:
- trained the people to personal courage when the virtue of timidity threatened to become an epidemic
- developed the individual's powers of resolute decision, and this at a time when a spirit of indecision and scepticism governed human conduct
- imbued its members with a spirit of idealism and developed their readiness to sacrifice themselves for their country and its honour, while greed and materialism dominated in all the other branches of life. 
- united a people who were split up into classes

 <!-- and when the spirit of sacrificing one's personal interests for the good of the community was considered as something that amounted almost to weakmindedness.  -->

<!-- At a time when only those were estimated as intelligent who knew how to safeguard and promote their own egotistic interests, the army was the school through which individual Germans were taught not to seek the salvation of their nation in the false ideology of international fraternization between negroes, Germans, Chinese,
French and English, etc., but in the strength and unity of their own national being. -->

<!-- 
At a time when the wiseacres were everywhere setting the fashion it needed courage to uphold the principle that any command is better than none. 

This one principle represents a robust and sound style of thought, of which not a trace would have been left in the other branches of life if the army had not furnished a constant rejuvenation of this  fundamental force. A sufficient proof of this may be found in the appalling lack of decision which our present government authorities display.  -->

<!-- They cannot shake off their mental and moral lethargy and decide on some definite line of action except when they
are forced to sign some new dictate for the exploitation of the German people. In that
case they decline all responsibility while at the same time they sign everything which
the other side places before them; and they sign with the readiness of an official stenographer. Their conduct is here explicable on the ground that in this case they are not under the necessity of coming to a decision; for the decision is dictated to them.  -->




The army allowed exemption from One Year Military Service to those who had passed through the high schools.
- This violated the principle of absolute equality 

Those who had a better education were thus placed outside the cadres to which the rest of their comrades belonged. 

Our upper classes were ignorant of what was going on in the nation and were estranged from the people.
- The army would have accomplished a very beneficial mission if it had refused to discriminate in favour of the so-called intellectuals, especially within its own ranks.

<!-- It was a mistake that this was not done; but in this world of ours can we find any institution that has not at least one
defect? And in the army the good features were so absolutely predominant that the few
defects it had were far below the average that generally rises from human weakness.
But the greatest credit which the army of the old Empire deserves is that, at a time when
the person of the individual counted for nothing and the majority was everything, it
placed individual personal values above majority values.

By insisting on its faith in personality, the army opposed that typically Jewish and democratic apotheosis of the
power of numbers. The army trained what at that time was most surely needed:
namely, real men. 

In a period when men were falling a prey to effeminacy and laxity, 350,000 vigorously trained young men went from the ranks of the army each year to mingle with their fellow-men. In the course of their two years' training they had lost the
softness of their young days and had developed bodies as tough as steel. The young
man who had been taught obedience for two years was now fitted to command. The
trained soldier could be recognized already by his walk.

This was the great school of the German nation; and it was not without reason that it
drew upon its head all the bitter hatred of those who wanted the Empire to be weak and
defenceless, because they were jealous of its greatness and were themselves possessed
by a spirit of rapacity and greed. The rest of the world recognized a fact which many
Germans did not wish to see, either because they were blind to facts or because out of
malice they did not wish to see it. This fact was that the German Army was the most 
powerful weapon for the defence and freedom of the German nation and the best
guarantee for the livelihood of its citizens. -->


3. The Civil Service

German administration was better organized and better carried out than the administration of other countries. 

There may have been objections to the bureaucratic routine of the officials, but from this point of view the state of affairs was similar, if not worse, in the other countries. 

But the other States did not have the wonderful solidarity which this organization possessed in Germany, nor were their civil servants of that
same high level of scrupulous honesty.

It is certainly better to be a trifle overbureaucratic and honest and loyal than to be over-sophisticated and modern, the latter often implying an inferior type of character and also ignorance and inefficiency. 

For if it be insinuated to-day that the German administration of the pre-War period may have been excellent so far as bureaucratic technique goes, but that from the practical business point of view it was incompetent, I can only give the following reply: What other country in the world possessed a better-organized and administered business enterprise than the German State Railways, for instance? 

The 1918 Revolution tried to destroy this standard organization through socialization to the international stock-exchange capitalists who were the wire-pullers of the German Revolution. 

The most outstanding trait in the civil service and the whole body of the civil administration was its independence of the vicissitudes of government, the political mentality of which could exercise no influence on the attitude of the German State officials. 

Since the Revolution this situation has been completely changed.

Efficiency and capability have been replaced by the test of party-adherence; and independence of character and initiative are no longer appreciated as positive qualities in a public official. They rather tell against him.

The wonderful might and power of the old Empire was based on the monarchical form of government, the army and the civil service. On these three foundations rested that great strength which is now entirely lacking; namely, the authority of the State. 

For the authority of the State cannot be based on the babbling that goes on in Parliament or in the provincial diets and not upon laws made to protect the State, or upon sentences passed by the law courts to frighten those who have had the hardihood to deny the authority of the State, but only on the general confidence which the management and administration of the community establishes among the people. 

<!-- This confidence is in its turn, nothing else than the result of an unshakable inner conviction that the government and administration of a country is inspired by disinterested and honest goodwill and on the feeling that the spirit of the law is in complete harmony with the moral convictions of the people. In the long run, systems of government are not maintained by terrorism but on the belief of the people in the merits and sincerity of those who administer and promote the public interests.

Before the War, certain grave evils tended to infect and corrode the inner strength of the nation, it must be remembered that the other States suffered even more than Germany from these drawbacks and yet those other States did not fail and break down when the time of crisis came. 

If we remember further that those defects in pre-War Germany were outweighed by great positive qualities we shall have to look elsewhere for the effective cause of the collapse. And elsewhere it lay. -->

The ultimate and most profound reason of the German downfall is to be found in the fact that the racial problem was ignored and that its importance in the historical development of nations was not grasped. 

<!-- For the events that take place in the life of nations are not due to chance but are the natural results of the effort to conserve and multiply the species and the race, even though men may not be able consciously to picture to their minds the profound motives of their conduct.  -->

### Notes

[Note 14. Probably the author has two separate incidents in mind. The first happened in 390 B.C., when, as the victorious Gauls descended on Rome, the Senators ordered their ivory chairs to be placed in the Forum before the Temples ofthe Gods. There, clad in their robes of state, they awaited the invader, hoping to save the city by sacrificing themselves. This noble gesture failed for the time being; but it had an inspiring influence on subsequent generations. The second incident, which has more historical authenticity, occurred after the Roman defeat at Cannae in 216 B.C. On that occasion Varro, the Roman commander, who, though in great part responsible for the disaster, made an effort to carry on the struggle, was, on his return to Rome, met by the citizens of all ranks and publicly thanked because he had not despaired of the Republic. The consequence was that the Republic refused to make peace with the victorious Carthagenians.]
