The amazing increase of German population before the war gave importance in politics and economics to the question of providing daily bread.

  <!-- into a more and more prominent position in all spheres of  thought and action.  -->

Unfortunately, those responsible could not make up their minds at a solution. They preferred to reach their objective by cheaper methods.

They disliked the idea of acquiring fresh territory. Instead, they went for the mad desire for the commercial conquest of the world. This would lead eventually to unlimited and injurious industrialization. 

This weakened the agricultural classes as the proletariat moved to the urban areas.

<!-- , until finally the equilibrium was completely upset.  -->

The big barrier dividing rich and poor now became apparent. 

<!-- Luxury and poverty lived so close to each other that the consequences were bound to be deplorable.  -->

Want and frequent unemployment began to play havoc with the people.

 <!-- and left discontent and embitterment behind them.  -->

This divided the population into political classes.

Discontent increased in spite of commercial prosperity. 

Soon, people felt that 'things cannot go on as they are'.

<!-- , although no one seemed able to visualize what was really going to happen. -->

<!-- These were typical and visible signs of the depths which the prevailing discontent had reached. Far worse than these, however, were other consequences which became apparent as a result of the industrialization of the nation.
In proportion to the extent that -->

Commerce assumed definite control of the State. Money became more and more of a God whom all had to serve and bow down to. 

<!-- Heavenly Gods became more and more old-fashioned and were laid away in the corners to make
room for the worship of mammon.  -->

<!-- Thus began a period of utter degeneration which became specially pernicious because it set in at a time when the nation was more than ever in need of an exalted idea, for a critical hour was threatening. Germany
should have been prepared to protect with the sword her efforts to win her own daily
bread in a peaceful way. -->

Unfortunately, the predominance of money received support and sanction in the very
quarter which ought to have been opposed to it. 

The Kaiser made a mistake when he raised representatives of the new finance capital to the ranks of the nobility.

Even Bismarck failed to realize the threatening danger in this respect. 

This made all ideal virtues secondary considerations to those of money.*

<!-- , for it was clear that having once taken this road, the nobility of the sword would very soon rank second to that of finance. -->

Financial operations succeed easier than war operations. Hence it was no longer any great attraction for a true hero or even a statesman to be brought into touch with the nearest Jew banker.

Real merit was not interested in receiving cheap decorations and therefore declined them. 
- But from the standpoint of good breeding such a development was deeply regrettable.

The nobility began to lose the racial qualities that made them nobility. Instead they became plebeians. 

A serious state of economic disruption was being brought about by:
- the slow elimination of the personal control of vested interests
- the gradual transference of the whole economic structure into the hands of joint stock companies.

In this way, labour became degraded into an object of speculation of unscrupulous exploiters.

The de-personalization of property ownership increased on a vast scale. 

Financial exchange circles began to triumph and made slow but sure progress in assuming control of the whole of national life.

Before the War, the internationalization of the German economic structure had already begun by the roundabout way of share issues. 

A section of the German industrialists made a determined attempt to avert the danger.
- But in the end, they gave way before the united attacks of money-grabbing capitalism which was assisted in this fight by its faithful henchmen in the Marxist movement.

The Marxists in the German government had envisioned the persistent war against German 'heavy industries' through the internationalization of German economic life which came after their successful 1918 Revolution. 

<!-- This, however, could only be brought to a successful conclusion by the victory which Marxism was able to gain in the Revolution.  -->

Currently, the German State Railways are to be turned over to international capitalists. 
- Thus 'International Social-Democracy' has once again attained one of its main objectives.



When the War was over, one of the leading captains of German industry and commerce, Mr. Stinnes, believed that  commerce was the only force which could put Germany on its feet again.
- This shows how far this 'commercialization' of the German nation has been.
- This sort of nonsense was uttered just at the time when France was restoring public education on a humanitarian basis -- doing away with the idea that national life dependens on commerce rather than ideal values. 

The statement which he broadcasted to the world at that time caused incredible confusion. 

It immediately became the leading motto of all the 'statesmen' whom Fate let loose on Germany after the 1918 Revolution.*

One of the worst evidences of decadence in Germany before the War was the habit of doing things by halves. This was caused  by a certain timidity which resulted from one cause or another. And the latter malady was aggravated by the educational system. 

<!-- This was one of the consequences of the insecurity that was felt all round. And it is to be attributed also  -->

German pre-War education had many weak features. 
- It focused on the production of pure knowledge. 
- It paid little attention to the development of practical ability. 
- It gave less attention to the development of individual character. 

Hardly any attention was given to:
- the development of a sense of responsibility
- strengthening the will and the powers of decision. 

This produced erudite people who had a passion for knowing everything. 

Before the War, we Germans were accepted and estimated accordingly. 

The German was liked because he was useful. But there was little esteem for him personally because of his weak character. 

Among all nationalities, Germans were the first to part with their national citizenship when they found themselves in a foreign country.

<!-- There is a world of meaning in the saying that was then prevalent: -->


<!-- , come what may, he never grovels before its representative. 

A man who is serious about the maintenance and welfare of an institution will not allow himself to be discouraged when the representatives of that institution show certain faults and failings. And he certainly will not run around to tell the world about it, as certain false democratic 'friends' of the monarchy have done; but he will approach His Majesty, the bearer of the Crown himself, to warn him of the seriousness of a situation and persuade the monarch to act. 

Furthermore, he will not take up the standpoint that it must be left to His Majesty to act as the latter thinks fit, even though the course which he would take must plainly lead to disaster. 


But the man I am thinking of will deem it his duty to protect the monarchy against the monarch  himself, no matter what personal risk he may run in doing so. 

If the worth of the monarchical institution be dependent on the person of the monarch himself, then it would be the worst institution imaginable; for only in rare cases are kings found to be models of wisdom and understanding, and integrity of character, though we might like to think otherwise. But this fact is unpalatable to the professional knaves and lackeys.

Yet all upright men, and they are the backbone of the nation, repudiate the nonsensical fiction that all monarchs are wise, etc. 

For such men history is history and truth is truth, even where monarchs are concerned. But if a nation should have the good luck to possess a great king or a great man it ought to consider itself as specially favoured above all the other nations, and these may be thankful if an adverse fortune has not allotted the worst to them. -->
