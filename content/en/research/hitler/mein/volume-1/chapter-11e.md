The Jews never had a civilization of their own.

They have always been furnished by others with a basis for their intellectual work.

The Jew's intellect has always developed by the use of those cultural achievements  which he has found ready-to-hand around him.

The process has never been the reverse.

The Jews have a stronger instinct of self-preservation than other races. 

But they lack the idealistic spirit.

<!-- This 
 though the impression may
easily be created that the intellectual powers of the Jew are at least equal to those of
other races, the Jews completely lack the most essential pre-requisite of a cultural
people, namely .  -->

With the Jewish people the readiness for sacrifice does not extend beyond the simple instinct of individual preservation. 

In their case the feeling of racial solidarity which they apparently manifest is nothing but a very primitive gregarious instinct, similar to that which may be found among other organisms in this world. 

It is a remarkable fact that this herd instinct brings individuals together for mutual protection only as long as there is a common danger which makes mutual assistance expedient or inevitable. 

The same pack of wolves which a moment ago joined together in a common attack on their victim will dissolve into individual
wolves as soon as their hunger has been satisfied. This is also sure of horses, which
unite to defend themselves against any aggressor but separate the moment the danger
is over.

It is much the same with the Jew. His spirit of sacrifice is only apparent. 

It manifests itself only so long as the existence of the individual makes this a matter of absolute necessity. 

But as soon as the common foe is conquered and the danger which threatened the individual Jews is overcome and the prey secured, then the apparent harmony disappears and the original conditions set in again. 

Jews act in concord only when a common danger threatens them or a common prey attracts them. Where these two motives no longer exist then the most brutal egotism appears and these people who before had lived together in unity will turn into a swarm of rats that bitterly fight
against each other.

If the Jews were the only people in the world they would be wallowing in filth and mire and would exploit one another and try to exterminate one another in a bitter struggle, except in so far as their utter lack of the ideal of sacrifice, which shows itself in their
cowardly spirit, would prevent this struggle from developing. 

Therefore it would be a complete mistake to interpret the mutual help which the Jews
render one another when they have to fight--or, to put it more accurately, to exploit--
their fellow being, as the expression of a certain idealistic spirit of sacrifice.


Here again the Jew merely follows the call of his individual egotism. That is why the Jewish State, which ought to be a vital organization to serve the purpose of preserving or increasing the race, has absolutely no territorial boundaries. For the territorial
delimitation of a State always demands a certain idealism of spirit on the part of the race which forms that State and especially a proper acceptance of the idea of work. 

A State which is territorially delimited cannot be established or maintained unless the general attitude towards work be a positive one. If this attitude be lacking, then the necessary basis of a civilization is also lacking.

That is why the Jewish people, despite the intellectual powers with which they are
apparently endowed, have not a culture--certainly not a culture of their own. The
culture which the Jew enjoys to-day is the product of the work of others and this
product is debased in the hands of the Jew.

In order to form a correct judgment of the place which the Jew holds in relation to the
whole problem of human civilization, we must bear in mind the essential fact that there
never has been any Jewish art and consequently that nothing of this kind exists to-day.

In architecture and music, the Jew has done no original creative work. 

When the Jew comes to producing something in the field of art he merely bowdler-izes something already in
existence or simply steals the intellectual word, of others. The Jew essentially lacks
those qualities which are characteristic of those creative races that are the founders of
civilization.

To what extent the Jew appropriates the civilization built up by others--or rather
corrupts it, to speak more accurately--is indicated by the fact that he cultivates chiefly
the art which calls for the smallest amount of original invention, namely the dramatic
art. 

And even here he is nothing better than a kind of juggler or, perhaps more correctly speaking, a kind of monkey imitator; for in this domain also he lacks the creative elan which is necessary for the production of all really great work. Even here, therefore, he is
not a creative genius but rather a superficial imitator who, in spite of all his retouching
and tricks, cannot disguise the fact that there is no inner vitality in the shape he gives
his products. 

At this juncture the Jewish Press comes in and renders friendly assistance
by shouting hosannas over the head of even the most ordinary bungler of a Jew, until
the rest of the world is stampeded into thinking that the object of so much praise must
really be an artist, whereas in reality he may be nothing more than a low-class mimic.
No; the Jews have not the creative abilities which are necessary to the founding of a
civilization; for in them there is not, and never has been, that spirit of idealism which is 
an absolutely necessary element in the higher development of mankind. Therefore the
Jewish intellect will never be constructive but always destructive. At best it may serve
as a stimulus in rare cases but only within the meaning of the poet's lines: 'THE POWER
WHICH ALWAYS WILLS THE BAD, AND ALWAYS WORKS THE GOOD' (KRAFT,
DIE STETS DAS BÃ–SE WILL UND STETS DAS GUTE SCHAFFT). (Note 15) It is not
through his help but in spite of his help that mankind makes any progress.

Since the Jew has never had a State which was based on territorial delimitations, and
therefore never a civilization of his own, the idea arose that here we were dealing with a
people who had to be considered as Nomads. That is a great and mischievous mistake.
The true nomad does actually possess a definite delimited territory where he lives. It is
merely that he does not cultivate it, as the settled farmer does, but that he lives on the
products of his herds, with which he wanders over his domain. The natural reason for
this mode of existence is to be found in the fact that the soil is not fertile and that it does
not give the steady produce which makes a fixed abode possible. Outside of this natural
cause, however, there is a more profound cause: namely, that no mechanical civilization
is at hand to make up for the natural poverty of the region in question. There are
territories where the Aryan can establish fixed settlements by means of the technical
skill which he has developed in the course of more than a thousand years, even though
these territories would otherwise have to be abandoned, unless the Aryan were willing
to wander about them in nomadic fashion; but his technical tradition and his age-long
experience of the use of technical means would probably make the nomadic life
unbearable for him. We ought to remember that during the first period of American
colonization numerous Aryans earned their daily livelihood as trappers and hunters,
etc., frequently wandering about in large groups with their women and children, their
mode of existence very much resembling that of ordinary nomads. The moment,
however, that they grew more numerous and were able to accumulate larger resources,
they cleared the land and drove out the aborigines, at the same time establishing
settlements which rapidly increased all over the country.

The Aryan himself was probably at first a nomad and became a settler in the course of
ages. But yet he was never of the Jewish kind. The Jew is not a nomad; for the nomad
has already a definite attitude towards the concept of 'work', and this attitude served as
the basis of a later cultural development, when the necessary intellectual conditions
were at hand. There is a certain amount of idealism in the general attitude of the
nomad, even though it be rather primitive. His whole character may, therefore, be
foreign to Aryan feeling but it will never be repulsive. But not even the slightest trace of
idealism exists in the Jewish character. The Jew has never been a nomad, but always a
parasite, battening on the substance of others. If he occasionally abandoned regions
where he had hitherto lived he did not do it voluntarily. He did it because from time to
time he was driven out by people who were tired of having their hospitality abused by
such guests. Jewish self-expansion is a parasitic phenomenon--since the Jew is always
looking for new pastures for his race. 

But this has nothing to do with nomadic life as such; because the Jew does not ever
think of leaving a territory which he has once occupied. He sticks where he is with such
tenacity that he can hardly be driven out even by superior physical force. He expands
into new territories only when certain conditions for his existence are provided therein;
but even then--unlike the nomad--he will not change his former abode. He is and
remains a parasite, a sponger who, like a pernicious bacillus, spreads over wider and
wider areas according as some favourable area attracts him. The effect produced by his
presence is also like that of the vampire; for wherever he establishes himself the people
who grant him hospitality are bound to be bled to death sooner or later. Thus the Jew
has at all times lived in States that have belonged to other races and within the
organization of those States he had formed a State of his own, which is, however,
hidden behind the mask of a 'religious community', as long as external circumstances
do not make it advisable for this community to declare its true nature. As soon as the
Jew feels himself sufficiently established in his position to be able to hold it without a
disguise, he lifts the mask and suddenly appears in the character which so many did
not formerly believe or wish to see: namely that of the Jew.

The life which the Jew lives as a parasite thriving on the substance of other nations and
States has resulted in developing that specific character which Schopenhauer once
described when he spoke of the Jew as 'The Great Master of Lies'. The kind of existence
which he leads forces the Jew to the systematic use of falsehood, just as naturally as the
inhabitants of northern climates are forced to wear warm clothes.
He can live among other nations and States only as long as he succeeds in persuading
them that the Jews are not a distinct people but the representatives of a religious faith
who thus constitute a 'religious community', though this be of a peculiar character.
As a matter of fact, however, this is the first of his great falsehoods.

He is obliged to conceal his own particular character and mode of life that he may be
allowed to continue his existence as a parasite among the nations. The greater the
intelligence of the individual Jew, the better will he succeed in deceiving others. His
success in this line may even go so far that the people who grant him hospitality may be
led to believe that the Jew among them is a genuine Frenchman, for instance, or
Englishman or German or Italian, who just happens to belong to a religious
denomination which is different from that prevailing in these countries. Especially in
circles concerned with the executive administration of the State, where the officials
generally have only a minimum of historical sense, the Jew is able to impose his
infamous deception with comparative ease. In these circles independent thinking is
considered a sin against the sacred rules according to which official promotion takes
place. It is therefore not surprising that even to-day in the Bavarian government offices,
for example, there is not the slightest suspicion that the Jews form a distinct nation 
themselves and are not merely the adherents of a 'Confession', though one glance at the
Press which belongs to the Jews ought to furnish sufficient evidence to the contrary
even for those who possess only the smallest degree of intelligence. The JEWISH ECHO,
however, is not an official gazette and therefore not authoritative in the eyes of those
government potentates.

Jewry has always been a nation of a definite racial character and never differentiated
merely by the fact of belonging to a certain religion. At a very early date, urged on by
the desire to make their way in the world, the Jews began to cast about for a means
whereby they might distract such attention as might prove inconvenient for them. What
could be more effective and at the same time more above suspicion than to borrow and
utilize the idea of the religious community? Here also everything is copied, or rather
stolen; for the Jew could not possess any religious institution which had developed out
of his own consciousness, seeing that he lacks every kind of idealism; which means that
belief in a life beyond this terrestrial existence is foreign to him. In the Aryan mind no
religion can ever be imagined unless it embodies the conviction that life in some form or
other will continue after death. As a matter of fact, the Talmud is not a book that lays
down principles according to which the individual should prepare for the life to come.
It only furnishes rules for a practical and convenient life in this world.
The religious teaching of the Jews is principally a collection of instructions for
maintaining the Jewish blood pure and for regulating intercourse between Jews and the
rest of the world: that is to say, their relation with non-Jews. But the Jewish religious
teaching is not concerned with moral problems. 

It is rather concerned with economic problems, and very petty ones at that. In regard to the moral value of the religious
teaching of the Jews there exist and always have existed quite exhaustive studies (not
from the Jewish side; for whatever the Jews have written on this question has naturally
always been of a tendentious character) which show up the kind of religion that the
Jews have in a light that makes it look very uncanny to the Aryan mind. The Jew
himself is the best example of the kind of product which this religious training evolves.
His life is of this world only and his mentality is as foreign to the true spirit of
Christianity as his character was foreign to the great Founder of this new creed two
thousand years ago. And the Founder of Christianity made no secret indeed of His
estimation of the Jewish people. When He found it necessary He drove those enemies of
the human race out of the Temple of God; because then, as always, they used religion as
a means of advancing their commercial interests. 

But at that time Christ was nailed to the Cross for his attitude towards the Jews; whereas our modern Christians enter into
party politics and when elections are being held they debase themselves to beg for
Jewish votes. They even enter into political intrigues with the atheistic Jewish parties
against the interests of their own Christian nation.

On this first and fundamental lie, the purpose of which is to make people believe that
Jewry is not a nation but a religion, other lies are subsequently based. One of those 
further lies, for example, is in connection with the language spoken by the Jew. For him
language is not an instrument for the expression of his inner thoughts but rather a
means of cloaking them. When talking French his thoughts are Jewish and when
writing German rhymes he only gives expression to the character of his own race.
As long as the Jew has not succeeded in mastering other peoples he is forced to speak
their language whether he likes it or not. 

But the moment that the world would become
the slave of the Jew it would have to learn some other language (Esperanto, for
example) so that by this means the Jew could dominate all the more easily.
How much the whole existence of this people is based on a permanent falsehood is
proved in a unique way by 'The Protocols of the Elders of Zion', which are so violently
repudiated by the Jews. With groans and moans, the FRANKFURTER ZEITUNG
repeats again and again that these are forgeries. This alone is evidence in favour of their
authenticity. What many Jews unconsciously wish to do is here clearly set forth. It is not
necessary to ask out of what Jewish brain these revelations sprang; but what is of vital
interest is that they disclose, with an almost terrifying precision, the mentality and
methods of action characteristic of the Jewish people and these writings expound in all
their various directions the final aims towards which the Jews are striving. The study of
real happenings, however, is the best way of judging the authenticity of those
documents. If the historical developments which have taken place within the last few
centuries be studied in the light of this book we shall understand why the Jewish Press
incessantly repudiates and denounces it. For the Jewish peril will be stamped out the
moment the general public come into possession of that book and understand it.
