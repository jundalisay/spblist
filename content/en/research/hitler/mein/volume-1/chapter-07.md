IN 1915, the enemy started his propaganda among our soldiers. 

From 1916 onwards, it steadily became more intensive.

At the beginning of 1918 it had swollen into a storm flood.

<!-- One could now judge the effects of this proselytizing movement step by step. -->

Gradually our soldiers began to think just in the way the enemy wished them to think.


Back then, the army were ready to do counter-propaganda. But unfortunately, they did not have the necessary means. And so  the German side, there was none.

Moreover, the army authorities would have made a psychological mistake had they undertaken this task of mental training. To be efficacious it had come from the home front. For only thus could it be successful among men who for nearly four years now had been performing immortal deeds of heroism and undergoing all sorts of privations for the sake of that home. 

But what were the people at home doing? Was their failure to act merely due to unintelligence or bad faith?

In the midsummer of 1918, after the evacuation of the southern bank of the hearne, the German Press adopted a criminally stupid policy.

<!--  which was so woefully inopportune, and even , that I used to ask myself a question which made me more and more
furious day after day: Is it really true that we have nobody who will dare to put an end to this process of spiritual sabotage which is being carried on among our heroic troops? -->

What happened in France during those days of 1914, when our armies invaded that country and were marching in triumph from one victory to another? What happened in Italy when their armies collapsed on the Isonzo front? 

What happened in France again during the spring of 1918, when German divisions took the main French positions by storm and heavy long-distance artillery bombarded Paris?

How they whipped up the flagging courage of those troops who were retreating and fanned the fires of national enthusiasm among them!

How their propaganda and their marvellous aptitude in the exercise of mass-influence reawakened the fighting spirit in that broken front and hammered into the heads of the soldiers a, firm belief in final victory! 

Meanwhile, what were our people doing in this sphere? Nothing. 

I became enraged as I read the latest papers and realized the nature of the mass-murder they were committing: through their influence on the minds of the people and the soldiers.

More than once I was tormented by the thought that if Providence had put the conduct of German propaganda into my
hands, instead of into the hands of those incompetent and even criminal ignoramuses and weaklings, the outcome of the struggle might have been different.

During those months I felt for the first time that Fate was dealing adversely with me in keeping me on the fighting front and in a position where any chance bullet from some nigger or other might finish me, whereas I could have done the Fatherland a real service in another sphere. 

<!-- For I was then presumptuous enough to believe that I would have been successful in managing the propaganda business.
But I was a being without a name, one among eight millions. 

Hence it was better for me to keep my mouth shut and do my duty as well as I could in the position to which I had
been assigned. -->

In the summer of 1915, the first enemy leaflets were dropped on our trenches. They all told the same story:
- distress was steadily on the increase in Germany
- the War would last indefinitely
- the prospect of victory for us was becoming fainter day after day
- the people at home were yearning for peace, but that 'Militarism' and the 'Kaiser' would not permit it
- the world was not waging war against the German people but only against the Kaiser
- until the Kaiser was removed there could be no end to the conflict
- when the War was over the democratic nations would receive the Germans as colleagues in the League for World Peace. 

This would be done the moment 'Prussian Militarism' had been finally destroyed.

<!-- To illustrate and substantiate all these statements, the leaflets very often contained 'Letters from Home', the contents of which appeared to confirm the enemy's propagandist message. -->

We only laughed at all these efforts. The leaflets were read, sent to base headquarters, then forgotten until a favourable wind once again blew a fresh contingent into the trenches.

One feature of this propaganda was very striking. It was that in sections where
Bavarian troops were stationed every effort was made by the enemy propagandists to
stir up feeling against the Prussians, assuring the soldiers that Prussia and Prussia alone 
was the guilty party who was responsible for bringing on and continuing the War, and
that there was no hostility whatsoever towards the Bavarians; but that there could be no
possibility of coming to their assistance so long as they continued to serve Prussian
interests and helped to pull the Prussian chestnuts out of the fire.
This persistent propaganda began to have a real influence on our soldiers in 1915. The
feeling against Prussia grew quite noticeable among the Bavarian troops, but those in
authority did nothing to counteract it. This was something more than a mere crime of
omission; for sooner or later not only the Prussians were bound to have to atone
severely for it but the whole German nation and consequently the Bavarians themselves
also.
In this direction the enemy propaganda began to achieve undoubted success from 1916
onwards.

In a similar way letters coming directly from home had long since been exercising their
effect. There was now no further necessity for the enemy to broadcast such letters in
leaflet form. And also against this influence from home nothing was done except a few
supremely stupid 'warnings' uttered by the executive government. The whole front was
drenched in this poison which thoughtless women at home sent out, without suspecting
for a moment that the enemy's chances of final victory were thus strengthened or that
the sufferings of their own men at the front were thus being prolonged and rendered
more severe. These stupid letters written by German women eventually cost the lives of
hundreds of thousands of our men.

Thus in 1916 several distressing phenomena were already manifest. The whole front
was complaining and grousing, discontented over many things and often justifiably so.
While they were hungry and yet patient, and their relatives at home were in distress, in
other quarters there was feasting and revelry. Yes; even on the front itself everything
was not as it ought to have been in this regard.

Even in the early stages of the war the soldiers were sometimes prone to complain; but
such criticism was confined to 'internal affairs'. The man who at one moment groused
and grumbled ceased his murmur after a few moments and went about his duty
silently, as if everything were in order. The company which had given signs of
discontent a moment earlier hung on now to its bit of trench, defending it tooth and
nail, as if Germany's fate depended on these few hundred yards of mud and shell-holes.
The glorious old army was still at its post. A sudden change in my own fortunes soon
placed me in a position where I had first-hand experience of the contrast between this
old army and the home front. At the end of September 1916 my division was sent into
the Battle of the Somme. For us this was the first of a series of heavy engagements, and
the impression created was that of a veritable inferno, rather than war. Through weeks
of incessant artillery bombardment we stood firm, at times ceding a little ground but 
then taking it back again, and never giving way. On October 7th, 1916, I was wounded
but had the luck of being able to get back to our lines and was then ordered to be sent
by ambulance train to Germany.

Two years had passed since I had left home, an almost endless period in such
circumstances. I could hardly imagine what Germans looked like without uniforms. In
the clearing hospital at Hermies I was startled when I suddenly heard the voice of a
German woman who was acting as nursing sister and talking with one of the wounded
men lying near me. Two years! And then this voice for the first time!
The nearer our ambulance train approached the German frontier the more restless each
one of us became. En route we recognised all these places through which we passed
two years before as young volunteers--Brussels, Louvain, Li√®ge--and finally we thought
we recognized the first German homestead, with its familiar high gables and
picturesque window-shutters. Home!

What a change! From the mud of the Somme battlefields to the spotless white beds in
this wonderful building. One hesitated at first before entering them. It was only by slow
stages that one could grow accustomed to this new world again. But unfortunately
there were certain other aspects also in which this new world was different.
The spirit of the army at the front appeared to be out of place here. For the first time I
encountered something which up to then was unknown at the front: namely, boasting
of one's own cowardice. For, though we certainly heard complaining and grousing at
the front, this was never in the spirit of any agitation to insubordination and certainly
not an attempt to glorify one's fear. No; there at the front a coward was a coward and
nothing else, And the contempt which his weakness aroused in the others was quite
general, just as the real hero was admired all round. But here in hospital the spirit was
quite different in some respects. Loudmouthed agitators were busy here in heaping
ridicule on the good soldier and painting the weak-kneed poltroon in glorious colours.
A couple of miserable human specimens were the ringleaders in this process of
defamation. One of them boasted of having intentionally injured his hand in barbedwire entanglements in order to get sent to hospital. Although his wound was only a
slight one, it appeared that he had been here for a very long time and would be here
interminably. Some arrangement for him seemed to be worked by some sort of swindle,
just as he got sent here in the ambulance train through a swindle. This pestilential
specimen actually had the audacity to parade his knavery as the manifestation of a
courage which was superior to that of the brave soldier who dies a hero's death. There
were many who heard this talk in silence; but there were others who expressed their
assent to what the fellow said.

Personally I was disgusted at the thought that a seditious agitator of this kind should be
allowed to remain in such an institution. What could be done? The hospital authorities 
here must have known who and what he was; and actually they did know. But still they
did nothing about it.

As soon as I was able to walk once again I obtained leave to visit Berlin.
Bitter want was in evidence everywhere. The metropolis, with its teeming millions, was
suffering from hunger. The talk that was current in the various places of refreshment
and hospices visited by the soldiers was much the same as that in our hospital. The
impression given was that these agitators purposely singled out such places in order to
spread their views.

But in Munich conditions were far worse. After my discharge from hospital, I was sent
to a reserve battalion there. I felt as in some strange town. Anger, discontent, complaints
met one's ears wherever one went. To a certain extent this was due to the infinitely
maladroit manner in which the soldiers who had returned from the front were treated
by the non-commissioned officers who had never seen a day's active service and who
on that account were partly incapable of adopting the proper attitude towards the old
soldiers. Naturally those old soldiers displayed certain characteristics which had been
developed from the experiences in the trenches. The officers of the reserve units could
not understand these peculiarities, whereas the officer home from active service was at
least in a position to understand them for himself. As a result he received more respect
from the men than officers at the home headquarters. But, apart from all this, the
general spirit was deplorable. The art of shirking was looked upon as almost a proof of
higher intelligence, and devotion to duty was considered a sign of weakness or bigotry.
Government offices were staffed by Jews. Almost every clerk was a Jew and every Jew
was a clerk. I was amazed at this multitude of combatants who belonged to the chosen
people and could not help comparing it with their slender numbers in the fighting lines.
In the business world the situation was even worse. Here the Jews had actually become
'indispensable'. Like leeches, they were slowly sucking the blood from the pores of the
national body. By means of newly floated War Companies an instrument had been
discovered whereby all national trade was throttled so that no business could be carried
on freely. Special emphasis was laid on the necessity for unhampered centralization. Hence as
early as 1916-17 practically all production was under the control of Jewish finance.
But against whom was the anger of the people directed? It was then that I already saw
the fateful day approaching which must finally bring the DEBACLE, unless timely
preventive measures were taken.

While Jewry was busy despoiling the nation and tightening the screws of its despotism,
the work of inciting the people against the Prussians increased. And just as nothing was 
done at the front to put a stop to the venomous propaganda, so here at home no official
steps were taken against it. Nobody seemed capable of understanding that the collapse
of Prussia could never bring about the rise of Bavaria. On the contrary, the collapse of
the one must necessarily drag the other down with it.

This kind of behaviour affected me very deeply. In it I could see only a clever Jewish
trick for diverting public attention from themselves to others. While Prussians and
Bavarians were squabbling, the Jews were taking away the sustenance of both from
under their very noses. While Prussians were being abused in Bavaria the Jews
organized the revolution and with one stroke smashed both Prussia and Bavaria.
I could not tolerate this execrable squabbling among people of the same German stock
and preferred to be at the front once again. Therefore, just after my arrival in Munich I
reported myself for service again. At the beginning of March 1917 I rejoined my old
regiment at the front.
