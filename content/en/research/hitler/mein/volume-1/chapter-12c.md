As early as 1919, we knew that our new movement should first aim for the nationalization of the masses. 

This created obligations for us: 

<!-- From the tactical standpoint, this decision laid a certain number of obligations on our shoulders.  -->

1. No social sacrifice could be considered too great to win over the masses for the national revival.

Our employers are mean and shortsighted to see that economic improvement and consequently a rise in profits requires internal solidarity to be restored among the masses.

The current concessions granted to the employees are negligible compared with the benefit to be reaped by the whole nation if such concessions bring back the masses to the bosom of their own nation.

The German industrialists were greedy for higher dividends.
- Even during the War, the German trade unions had used strike to force those industrialists to grant the workers' demands.

The War would never have been lost if the German trades unions had uncompromisingly defended the working-class interests during the War

<!-- if at the same time they had
stood up as good Germans for the defence of the nation as stoutly as for their own
claims, and if they had given to their country what was their country's due--then  -->

<!-- . How ludicrously insignificant would all, and even the
greatest, economic concession have been in face of the tremendous importance of such a
victory. -->

To restore the German worker to the German people, economic sacrifices must be made as long as they do not endanger the independence and stability of the national economic system.

2. The nationalist education of the masses can be done only indirectly by improving their social conditions

Only by such a process can the economic conditions be created which enable everybody to share in the cultural life of the nation.


3. The nationalization of the broad masses can never be achieved by half-measures

It can be achieved only through a ruthless and devoted insistence on the one aim to be achieved.

This means that a people cannot be made 'national' according to the signification attached to that word by our bourgeois class to-day--that is to say, nationalism with many reservations--but national in the vehement and extreme sense. 

Poison can be overcome only by a counter-poison, and only the supine bourgeois mind could think that the
Kingdom of Heaven can be attained by a compromise.

The broad masses of a nation are not made up of professors and diplomats. Since these masses have only a poor acquaintance with abstract ideas, their reactions lie more in the domain of the feelings, where the roots of their positive as well as their negative attitudes are implanted.

They are susceptible only to a manifestation of strength which comes definitely either from the positive or negative side, but they are never susceptible to any half-hearted attitude that wavers between one pole and the other. The emotional grounds of their attitude furnish the reason for their extraordinary stability. 

It is always more difficult to fight successfully against Faith than against knowledge. Love is less subject to change than respect. Hatred is more lasting than mere aversion.

The driving force which has brought about the most tremendous revolutions on this earth has never been a body of scientific teaching which has gained power over the masses, but always a devotion which has inspired them, and often a kind of hysteria which has urged them to action.

Whoever wishes to win over the masses must know the key that will open the door to
their hearts. It is not objectivity, which is a feckless attitude, but a determined will,
backed up by force, when necessary.

4. The soul of the masses can be won only if those who lead the movement are also determined to destroy the enemy that opposes them.

When they see an uncompromising onslaught against an adversary the people have at all times taken this as a proof that right is on the side of the active aggressor.

But if the aggressor should go only half-way and fail to push home his success by driving his opponent entirely from the scene of action, the people will look upon this as a sign that the aggressor is uncertain of the justice of his own cause and his half-way policy may even be an acknowledgment that his cause is unjust.

The masses are but a part of Nature herself. 

Their feeling is such that they cannot understand mutual hand-shakings between men who are declared enemies. Their wish is to see the stronger side win and the weaker wiped out or subjected unconditionally to the will of the stronger.

The nationalization of the masses can be successfully achieved only if, in the positive struggle to win the soul of the people, those who spread the international poison among them are exterminated.

(5) All the great problems of our time are problems of the moment and are only the results of certain definite causes. And among all those there is only one that has a  profoundly causal significance. This is the problem of preserving the pure racial stock among the people. 

Human vigour or decline depends on the blood. Nations that are not aware of the importance of their racial stock, or which neglect to preserve it, are like men who would try to educate the pug-dog to do the work of the greyhound, not
understanding that neither the speed of the greyhound nor the imitative faculties of the poodle are inborn qualities which cannot be drilled into the one or the other by any form of training. 

A people that fails to preserve the purity of its racial blood thereby destroys the unity of the soul of the nation in all its manifestations. A disintegrated national character is the inevitable consequence of a process of disintegration in the blood.

The change which takes place in the spiritual and creative faculties of a people is only an effect of the change that has modified its racial substance.

If we are to free the German people from all those failings and ways of acting which do
not spring from their original character, we must first get rid of those foreign germs in
the national body which are the cause of its failings and false ways.

The German nation will never revive unless the racial problem is taken into account and
dealt with. The racial problem furnishes the key not only to the understanding of
human history but also to the understanding of every kind of human culture.

6. By incorporating in the national community the masses of our people who are now
in the international camp we do not thereby mean to renounce the principle that the
interests of the various trades and professions must be safeguarded. Divergent interests
in the various branches of labour and in the trades and professions are not the same as a
division between the various classes, but rather a feature inherent in the economic
situation. Vocational grouping does not clash in the least with the idea of a national
community, for this means national unity in regard to all those problems that affect the
life of the nation as such.

To incorporate in the national community, or simply the State, a stratum of the people
which has now formed a social class the standing of the higher classes must not be
lowered but that of the lower classes must be raised. The class which carries through
this process is never the higher class but rather the lower one which is fighting for
equality of rights. The bourgeoisie of to-day was not incorporated in the State through
measures enacted by the feudal nobility but only through its own energy and a
leadership that had sprung from its own ranks.

The German worker cannot be raised from his present standing and incorporated in the
German folk-community by means of goody-goody meetings where people talk about
the brotherhood of the people, but rather by a systematic improvement in the social and
cultural life of the worker until the yawning abyss between him and the other classes
can be filled in. A movement which has this for its aim must try to recruit its followers
mainly from the ranks of the working class. It must include members of the intellectual 
classes only in so far as such members have rightly understood and accepted without
reserve the ideal towards which the movement is striving. This process of
transformation and reunion cannot be completed within ten or twenty years. It will take
several generations, as the history of such movements has shown.

The most difficult obstacle to the reunion of our contemporary worker in the national
folk-community does not consist so much in the fact that he fights for the interests of his
fellow-workers, but rather in the international ideas with which he is imbued and
which are of their nature at variance with the ideas of nationhood and fatherland. This
hostile attitude to nation and fatherland has been inculcated by the leaders of the
working class. If they were inspired by the principle of devotion to the nation in all that
concerns its political and social welfare, the trades unions would make those millions of
workers most valuable members of the national community, without thereby affecting
their own constant struggle for their economic demands.

A movement which sincerely endeavours to bring the German worker back into his
folk-community, and rescue him from the folly of internationalism, must wage a
vigorous campaign against certain notions that are prevalent among the industrialists.
One of these notions is that according to the concept of the folk-community, the
employee is obliged to surrender all his economic rights to the employer and, further,
that the workers would come into conflict with the folk-community if they should
attempt to defend their own just and vital interests. Those who try to propagate such a
notion are deliberate liars. The idea of a folk-community does not impose any
obligations on the one side that are not imposed on the other.
A worker certainly does something which is contrary to the spirit of folk-community if
he acts entirely on his own initiative and puts forward exaggerated demands without
taking the common good into consideration or the maintenance of the national
economic structure. But an industrialist also acts against the spirit of the folkcommunity if he adopts inhuman methods of exploitation and misuses the working
forces of the nation to make millions unjustly for himself from the sweat of the workers.
He has no right to call himself 'national' and no right to talk of a folk-community, for he
is only an unscrupulous egoist who sows the seeds of social discontent and provokes a
spirit of conflict which sooner or later must be injurious to the interests of the country.
The reservoir from which the young movement has to draw its members will first of all
be the working masses. Those masses must be delivered from the clutches of the
international mania. Their social distress must be eliminated. They must be raised
above their present cultural level, which is deplorable, and transformed into a resolute
and valuable factor in the folk-community, inspired by national ideas and national
sentiment. 

If among those intellectual circles that are nationalist in their outlook men can be found
who genuinely love the people and look forward eagerly to the future of Germany, and
at the same time have a sound grasp of the importance of a struggle whose aim is to
win over the soul of the masses, such men are cordially welcomed in the ranks of our
movement, because they can serve as a valuable intellectual force in the work that has
to be done. But this movement can never aim at recruiting its membership from the
unthinking herd of bourgeois voters. If it did so the movement would be burdened with
a mass of people whose whole mentality would only help to paralyse the effort of our
campaign to win the mass of the people. In theory it may be very fine to say that the
broad masses ought to be influenced by a combined leadership of the upper and lower
social strata within the framework of the one movement; but, notwithstanding all this,
the fact remains that though it may be possible to exercise a psychological influence on
the bourgeois classes and to arouse some enthusiasm or even awaken some
understanding among them by our public demonstrations, their traditional
characteristics cannot be changed. In other words, we could not eliminate from the
bourgeois classes the inefficiency and supineness which are part of a tradition that has
developed through centuries. The difference between the cultural levels of the two
groups and between their respective attitudes towards social-economic questions is still
so great that it would turn out a hindrance to the movement the moment the first
enthusiasm aroused by our demonstrations calmed down.

Finally, it is not part of our programme to transform the nationalist camp itself, but
rather to win over those who are anti-national in their outlook. It is from this viewpoint
that the strategy of the whole movement must finally be decided.
