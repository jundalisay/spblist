The failure to see the truth of all this constituted what may be called the tragic crime of the Habsburg rulers.

<!-- Only before the eyes of one Habsburg ruler, and that for the last time, did the hand of Destiny hold aloft the torch that threw light on the future of his country. But the torch was then extinguished for ever. -->

Joseph II was the Roman Emperor of the German nation. He grew anxious when he realized the fact that his House was removed to an outlying frontier of his Empire.

<!--  and that the time would soon be at hand when it would be overturned and
engulfed in the whirlpool caused by that Babylon of nationalities, unless something was
done at the eleventh hour to overcome the dire consequences resulting from the
negligence of his ancestors.  -->

With superhuman energy this 'Friend of Mankind' made every possible effort to counteract the effects of the carelessness and thoughtlessness of his predecessors. 

Within one decade, he strove to repair the damage that had been done through centuries. 

The miracle might have been performed if:
- he had been given 40 years for his labours
- two generations had carried on the work which he had started


But when he died, broken in body and spirit after ten years of rulership, his work sank with him into the grave.

<!--  and rests with him there in the
Capucin Crypt, sleeping its eternal sleep, having never again showed signs of
awakening. -->

His successors had neither the ability nor the will-power necessary for the task they had to face. 

When the first signs of a new revolutionary epoch appeared in Europe they gradually scattered the fire throughout Austria. 

When the fire began to glow steadily, it was fed by nationalist yearnings of the various ethnic groups.

The European revolutionary movement of 1848 took the form of a class conflict in almost every other country.

But in Austria, it took the form of a new racial struggle. 

<!-- In so far as the German-Austrians there forgot the origins of the movement, or perhaps had failed to recognize them at the start and consequently took part in the revolutionary uprising, they sealed their own fate.  -->

This helped to awaken the spirit of Western Democracy which, within a short while, shattered the foundations of their own existence.


The first great blow to the predominance of the German element in the Dual Monarchy was the setting up of a representative parliamentary body without having a single language for all public intercourse under the State.

From that moment, the State was also doomed to collapse sooner or later. 

<!-- All that followed was nothing but the historical liquidation of an Empire.  -->

<!-- To watch that process of progressive disintegration was a tragic and at the same time an instructive experience. The execution of history's decree was carried out in thousands of details. The fact that great numbers of people went about blindfolded amid the manifest signs of dissolution only proves that the gods had decreed the destruction of Austria.
I do not wish to dwell on details because that would lie outside the scope of this book. 

I want to treat in detail only those events which are typical among the causes that lead to the decline of nations and States and which are therefore of importance to our present age. Moreover, the study of these events helped to furnish the basis of my own political outlook. -->

<!-- Among the institutions which , even to the weak-sighted Philistine, was that which, of all the institutions of State, ought to have been the most firmly founded--I mean  -->

The Parliament, or Reichsrat (Imperial Council) as it was called in Austria, most clearly manifested unmistakable signs of decay.

It was a corporate body patterned after that in England, the land of classic democracy.

<!-- The whole of that excellent organization was bodily transferred to Austria with as little alteration as possible. -->

The Austrian counterpart to the British two-chamber system was a Chamber of Deputies and a House of Lords (HERRENHAUS) established in Vienna.

<!-- The Houses themselves, considered as buildings were somewhat different. When Barry built his palaces, or, as we say the Houses of Parliament, on the shore of the Thames, he could look to the history of the British Empire for the inspiration of his work.  -->

<!-- In that history he found sufficient material to fill and decorate the 1,200 niches, brackets, and pillars of his magnificent edifice. His statues and paintings made the House of Lords and the House of Commons temples dedicated to the glory of the nation.

There it was that Vienna encountered the first difficulty. When Hansen, the Danish architect, had completed the last gable of the marble palace in which the new body of popular representatives was to be housed he had to turn to the ancient classical world for subjects to fill out his decorative plan. 

This theatrical shrine of 'Western Democracy' was adorned with the statues and portraits of Greek and Roman statesmen and philosophers. As if it were meant for a symbol of irony, the horses of the quadriga that surmounts the two Houses are pulling apart from one another towards all four quarters of the globe. There could be no better symbol for the kind of activity going on within the walls of that same building.

The 'nationalities' were opposed to any kind of glorification of Austrian history in the
decoration of this building, insisting that such would constitute an offence to them and
a provocation. Much the same happened in Germany, where the Reich-stag, built by
Wallot, was not dedicated to the German people until the cannons were thundering in
the World War. And then it was dedicated by an inscription.

I was not yet twenty years of age when I first entered the Palace on the Franzens-ring to watch and listen in the Chamber of Deputies. That first experience aroused in me a profound feeling of repugnance. -->


I had always hated the Parliament, but not as an institution in itself. Quite the contrary. As one who cherished ideals of political freedom I could not even imagine any other form of government. 

In the light of my attitude towards the House of Habsburg I should then have considered it a crime against liberty and reason to think of any kind of dictatorship as a possible form of government.

A certain admiration which I had for the British Parliament contributed towards the formation of this opinion. I became imbued with that feeling of admiration almost without my being conscious of the effect of it through so much reading of newspapers while I was yet quite young.

I could not discard that admiration all in a moment. The dignified way in which the British House of Commons fulfilled its function impressed me greatly, thanks largely to the glowing terms in which the Austrian Press reported these events. 

I used to ask myself whether there could be any nobler form of government than self-government by the people.

But these considerations furnished the very motives of my hostility to the Austrian Parliament. The form in which parliamentary government was here represented  seemed unworthy of its great prototype. The following considerations also influenced my attitude:
