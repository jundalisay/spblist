The German International Socialist may be plundered by his comrades in all the other countries of the world in the name of 'solidarity'.

But he responds with fraternal kindness and never thinks of trying to get his own back, or even of defending himself. 

And why? Because he is a--German.

It may be unpleasant to dwell on such truths, but if something is to be changed we must start by diagnosing the disease.

The phenomenon which I have just described also accounts for the feeble manner in which German interests are promoted and defended by a section of the clergy.

Such conduct is not the manifestation of a malicious intent, nor is it the outcome of orders given from 'above', as we say; but such a lack of national grit and determination is due to defects in our educational system.

For, instead of inculcating in the youth a lively sense of their German nationality, the aim of the educational system is to make the youth prostrate themselves in homage to the idea, as if the idea were an idol. 

The education which makes them the devotees of such abstract notions as 'Democracy', 'International Socialism', 'Pacifism', etc., is so hard-and-fast and exclusive and, operating as it does from within outwards, is so purely subjective that in forming their general picture of outside life as a whole they are fundamentally influenced by these A PRIORI notions. 

But, on the other hand, the attitude towards their own German nationality has been very objective from youth upwards. The Pacifist--in so far as he is a German--who surrenders himself subjectively, body and soul, to the dictates of his dogmatic principles, will always first consider the objective right or wrong of a situation when danger threatens his own people, even though that danger be grave and unjustly wrought from outside.

But he will never take his stand in the ranks of his own people and fight for and with them from the sheer instinct of self-preservation.

Another example may further illustrate how far this applies to the different religious denominations. In so far as its origin and tradition are based on German ideals, Protestantism of itself defends those ideals better. But it fails the moment it is called upon to defend national interests which do not belong to the sphere of its ideals and traditional development, or which, for some reason or other, may be rejected by that sphere.

Therefore Protestantism will always take its part in promoting German ideals as far as concerns moral integrity or national education, when the German spiritual being or language or spiritual freedom are to be defended: because these represent the principles on which Protestantism itself is grounded.

But this same Protestantism violently opposes every attempt to rescue the nation from the clutches of its mortal enemy; because the Protestant attitude towards the Jews is more or less rigidly and dogmatically fixed. And yet this is the first problem which has to be solved, unless all attempts to bring about a German resurgence or to raise the level of the nation's standing are doomed to turn out nonsensical and impossible.

During my sojourn in Vienna I had ample leisure and opportunity to study this problem without allowing any prejudices to intervene; and in my daily intercourse with people I was able to establish the correctness of the opinion I formed by the test of thousands of instances.

In this focus where the greatest varieties of nationality had converged it was quite clear and open to everybody to see that the German pacifist was always and exclusively the one who tried to consider the interests of his own nation objectively; but you could never find a Jew who took a similar attitude towards his own race. 

Furthermore, I found that only the German Socialist is 'international' in the sense that he feels himself obliged not to demand justice for his own people in any other manner than by whining and wailing to his international comrades. Nobody could ever reproach Czechs or Poles or other nations with such conduct. In short, even at that time, already I recognized that this evil is only partly a result of the doctrines taught by Socialism, Pacifism, etc., but mainly the result of our totally inadequate system of education, the defects of which are responsible for the lack of devotion to our own national ideals.

Therefore the first theoretical argument advanced by the Pan-German leaders as the basis of their offensive against Catholicism was quite entenable.

The only way to remedy the evil I have been speaking of is to train the Germans from youth upwards to an absolute recognition of the rights of their own people, instead of poisoning their minds, while they are still only children, with the virus of this curbed 'objectivity', even in matters concerning the very maintenance of our own existence. The result of this would be that the Catholic in Germany, just as in Ireland, Poland or France, will be a German first and foremost. But all this presupposes a radical change in the national government.

The strongest proof in support of my contention is furnished by what took place at that
historical juncture when our people were called for the last time before the tribunal of
History to defend their own existence, in a life-or-death struggle.

As long as there was no lack of leadership in the higher circles, the people fulfilled their duty and obligations to an overwhelming extent. Whether Protestant pastor or Catholic priest, each did his very utmost in helping our powers of resistance to hold out, not only in the trenches but also, and even more so, at home.

During those years, and especially during the first outburst of enthusiasm, in both religious camps there was one undivided and sacred German Empire for whose preservation and future existence they all prayed to Heaven.

The Pan-German Movement in Austria ought to have asked itself this one question: Is the maintenance of the German element in Austria possible or not, as long as that element remains within the fold of the Catholic Faith? If that question should have been answered in the affirmative, then the political Party should not have meddled in religious and denominational questions. But if the question had to be answered in the negative, then a religious reformation should have been started and not a political party movement.

Anyone who believes that a religious reformation can be achieved through the agency of a political organization shows that he has no idea of the development of religious conceptions and doctrines of faith and how these are given practical effect by the Church.

No man can serve two masters. And I hold that the foundation or overthrow of a religion has far greater consequences than the foundation or overthrow of a State, to say nothing of a Party.

It is no argument to the contrary to say that the attacks were only defensive measures against attacks from the other side.
Undoubtedly there have always been unscrupulous rogues who did not hesitate to degrade religion to the base uses of politics. 

Nearly always such a people had nothing else in their minds except to make a business of religions and politics. But on the other hand it would be wrong to hold religion itself, or a religious denomination, responsible for a number of rascals who exploit the Church for their own base interests just as they would exploit anything else in which they had a part. 

Nothing could be more to the taste of one of these parliamentary loungers and tricksters than to be able to find a scapegoat for his political sharp-practice--after the event, of course. The moment religion or a religious denomination is attacked and made responsible for his personal misdeeds this shrewd fellow will raise a row at once and call the world to witness how justified he was in acting as he did, proclaiming that he and his eloquence alone have saved religion and the Church. 

The public, which is mostly stupid and has a very short memory, is not capable of recognizing the real instigator of the quarrel in the midst of the turmoil that has been raised. Frequently it does not remember the beginning of the fight and so the rogue gets by with his stunt. 

A cunning fellow of that sort is quite well aware that his misdeeds have nothing to do with religion. And so he will laugh up his sleeve all the more heartily when his honest but artless adversary loses the game and, one day losing all faith in humanity, retires from the activities of public life.

But from another viewpoint also it would be wrong to make religion, or the Church as such, responsible for the misdeeds of individuals. If one compares the magnitude of the organization, as it stands visible to every eye, with the average weakness of human nature we shall have to admit that the proportion of good to bad is more favourable
here than anywhere else.

Among the priests there may, of course, be some who use their sacred calling to further their political ambitions. There are clergy who unfortunately forget that in the political mêlée they ought to be the paladins of the more
sublime truths and not the abettors of falsehood and slander. But for each one of these
unworthy specimens we can find a thousand or more who fulfil their mission nobly as
the trustworthy guardians of souls and who tower above the level of our corrupt epoch,
as little islands above the seaswamp.

I cannot condemn the Church as such, and I should feel quite as little justified in doing so if some depraved person in the robe of a priest commits some offence against the moral law. 

Nor should I for a moment think of blaming the Church if one of its innumerable members betrays and besmirches his compatriots, especially not in epochs when such conduct is quite common. We must not forget, particularly in our day, that
for one such Ephialtes (Note 7) there are a thousand whose hearts bleed in sympathy
with their people during these years of misfortune and who, together with the best of
our nation, yearn for the hour when fortune will smile on us again.

If it be objected that here we are concerned not with the petty problems of everyday life but principally with fundamental truths and questions of dogma, the only way of answering that objection is to ask a question:

Do you feel that Providence has called you to proclaim the Truth to the world? If so, then go and do it. But you ought to have the courage to do it directly and not use some political party as your mouthpiece; for in this way you shirk your vocation. In the place of something that now exists and is bad put something else that is better and will last
into the future.

If you lack the requisite courage or if you yourself do not know clearly what your better
substitute ought to be, leave the whole thing alone. But, whatever happens, do not try
to reach the goal by the roundabout way of a political party if you are not brave enough
to fight with your visor lifted.
Political parties have no right to meddle in religious questions except when these relate
to something that is alien to the national well-being and thus calculated to undermine
racial customs and morals.
If some ecclesiastical dignitaries should misuse religious ceremonies or religious
teaching to injure their own nation their opponents ought never to take the same road
and fight them with the same weapons.
To a political leader the religious teachings and practices of his people should be sacred
and inviolable. Otherwise he should not be a statesman but a reformer, if he has the
necessary qualities for such a mission.

Any other line of conduct will lead to disaster, especially in Germany.
In studying the Pan-German Movement and its conflict with Rome I was then firmly
persuaded, and especially in the course of later years, that by their failure to understand
the importance of the social problem the Pan-Germanists lost the support of the broad
masses, who are the indispensable combatants in such a movement. By entering
Parliament the Pan-German leaders deprived themselves of the great driving force
which resides in the masses and at the same time they laid on their own shoulders all
the defects of the parliamentary institution. Their struggle against the Church made
their position impossible in numerous circles of the lower and middle class, while at the
same time it robbed them of innumerable high-class elements--some of the best indeed
that the nation possessed. The practical outcome of the Austrian Kulturkampf was
negative.

Although they succeeded in winning 100,000 members away from the Church, that did
not do much harm to the latter. The Church did not really need to shed any tears over
these lost sheep, for it lost only those who had for a long time ceased to belong to it in
their inner hearts. The difference between this new reformation and the great
Reformation was that in the historic epoch of the great Reformation some of the best
members left the Church because of religious convictions, whereas in this new
reformation only those left who had been indifferent before and who were now 
influenced by political considerations. From the political point of view alone the result
was as ridiculous as it was deplorable.

Once again a political movement which had promised so much for the German nation
collapsed, because it was not conducted in a spirit of unflinching adherence to naked
reality, but lost itself in fields where it was bound to get broken up.
The Pan-German Movement would never have made this mistake if it had properly
understood the PSYCHE of the broad masses. If the leaders had known that, for
psychological reasons alone, it is not expedient to place two or more sets of adversaries
before the masses--since that leads to a complete splitting up of their fighting strength--
they would have concentrated the full and undivided force of their attack against a
single adversary. Nothing in the policy of a political party is so fraught with danger as
to allow its decisions to be directed by people who want to have their fingers in every
pie though they do not know how to cook the simplest dish.
But even though there is much that can really be said against the various religious
denominations, political leaders must not forget that the experience of history teaches
us that no purely political party in similar circumstances ever succeeded in bringing
about a religious reformation. One does not study history for the purpose of forgetting
or mistrusting its lessons afterwards, when the time comes to apply these lessons in
practice. It would be a mistake to believe that in this particular case things were
different, so that the eternal truths of history were no longer applicable. One learns
history in order to be able to apply its lessons to the present time and whoever fails to
do this cannot pretend to be a political leader. In reality he is quite a superficial person
or, as is mostly the case, a conceited simpleton whose good intentions cannot make up
for his incompetence in practical affairs.
