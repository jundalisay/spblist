<!-- ### The State of Israel as a refuge for swindlers -->

(k) The Jewish domination in the State seems now so fully assured.

 <!-- not only can he now afford to call himself a Jew once again, but he even acknowledges freely and openly what his ideas are on racial and political questions. A section of the Jews avows itself quite openly as an alien people, but even here there is another falsehood.  -->

Zionists try to make the rest of the world believe that their new national consciousness is the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine.

<!-- , the Jews thereby adopt another means to dupe the simple-minded Gentile.  -->

**They have not the slightest intention of building up a Jewish State in Palestine so as to live in it.** 

What they really are aiming at is to establish a central organization for their international swindling and cheating. 

As a sovereign State, this cannot be controlled by any of the other States. 

Therefore, it can serve as a refuge for swindlers who have been found out and at the same time a high-school for the training of other swindlers.

As a sign of their growing presumption and sense of security:
- one section of them openly and impudently proclaim their Jewish nationality 
- another section hypocritically pretend that they are German, French or English. 

<!-- Their blatant behaviour in their relations with other people shows how clearly they envisage their day of triumph in the near future. -->

The black-haired Jewish youth lies in wait for hours on end, satanically glaring at and spying on the unsuspicious girl whom he plans to seduce, adulterating her blood and removing her from the bosom of her own people. 

The Jew uses every possible means to undermine the racial foundations of a subjugated people. 

In his systematic efforts to ruin girls and women, he strives to break down the last barriers of discrimination between him and other peoples.

The Jews were responsible for bringing negroes into the Rhineland.
- Their ultimate idea was to bastardize the white race which they hate and lower its cultural and political level so that they can dominate. 

For as long as a people remain racially pure and are conscious of the treasure of their blood, they can never be overcome by the Jew. Never in this world can the Jew become master of any people except a bastardized people.

That is why the Jew systematically endeavours to lower the racial quality of a people by permanently adulterating the blood of the individuals who make up that people. 

In the field of politics he now begins to replace the idea of democracy by introducing the dictatorship of the proletariat. 

In the masses organized under the Marxist banners he has found a weapon which makes it possible for him to discard democracy, so as to subjugate and rule in a dictatorial fashion by the aid of brute force. He is systematically working in two ways to bring about this revolution. These ways are the economic and the political respectively.

Aided by international influences, he forms a ring of enemies around those nations which have proved themselves too sturdy for him in withstanding attacks from within. 

He would like to force them into war and then, if it should be necessary to his plans, he will unfurl the banners of revolt even while the troops are actually fighting at the front.

Economically he brings about the destruction of the State by a systematic method of sabotaging social enterprises until these become so costly that they are taken out of the hands of the State and then submitted to the control of Jewish finance. 

Politically he works to withdraw from the State its means of susbsistence, inasmuch as he undermines the foundations of national resistance and defence, destroys the confidence which the people have in their Government, reviles the past and its history and drags everything national down into the gutter.

Culturally his activity consists in bowdlerizing art, literature and the theatre, holding the expressions of national sentiment up to scorn, overturning all concepts of the sublime and beautiful, the worthy and the good, finally dragging the people to the level of his own low mentality.

Of religion he makes a mockery. Morality and decency are described as antiquated prejudices and thus a systematic attack is made to undermine those last foundations on  which the national being must rest if the nation is to struggle for its existence in this world.



(l) Now begins the great and final revolution. 

As soon as the Jew is in possession of political power he drops the last few veils which have hitherto helped to conceal his features. 

Out of the democratic Jew, the Jew of the People, arises the 'Jew of the Blood', the tyrant of the peoples. 

In the course of a few years he endeavours to exterminate all those who represent the national intelligence. By thus, depriving the peoples of their natural intellectual leaders he fits them for their fate as slaves under a lasting despotism.

Russia furnishes the most terrible example of such a slavery.

In that country the Jew killed or starved 30 millions of the people, in a bout of savage fanaticism and partly by the employment of inhuman torture. And he did this so that a gang of Jewish literati and financial bandits should dominate over a great people.

But the final consequence is not merely that the people lose all their freedom under the domination of the Jews, but that in the end these parasites themselves disappear. 

The death of the victim is followed sooner or later by that of the vampire. 

The most profound and decisive cause of the downfall of the German people is:
- the lack of insight into the racial problem and
- especially the failure to recognize the Jewish danger.

It would have been easy enough to endure the defeats suffered on the battlefields in August 1918. 

They were nothing when compared with the military victories which our nation had achieved. 

Our downfall was not the result of those defeats. We were overthrown by that force which had prepared those defeats by systematically operating for several decades to destroy those political instincts and that moral stamina which alone secure for its people the right to exist. 

By neglecting the problem of preserving the racial foundations of our national life, the old Empire abrogated the sole right which entitles a people to live on this planet. 

Nations that make mongrels of their people, or allow their people to be turned into mongrels, sin against the Will of Eternal Providence. 

Thus, their overthrow at the hands of a stronger opponent cannot be looked upon as a wrong but, on the contrary, as a restoration of justice. 

If a people refuses to guard and uphold the qualities with which it has been endowed by Nature and which have their roots in the racial blood, then such a people has no right to complain over the loss of its earthly existence.

Everything on this earth can be made into something better. Every defeat may be made the foundation of a future victory. Every lost war may be the cause of a later resurgence.  Every visitation of distress can give a new impetus to human energy. 

And out of every oppression those forces can develop which bring about a new re-birth of the national
soul--provided always that the racial blood is kept pure.

But the loss of racial purity will wreck inner happiness for ever. It degrades men for all time to come. And the physical and moral consequences can never be wiped out. If this unique problem be studied and compared with the other problems of life we shall easily recognize how small is their importance in comparison with this. They are all limited to time; but the problem of the maintenance or loss of the purity of the racial blood will last as long as man himself lasts.

All the symptoms of decline which manifested themselves already in pre-war times can
be traced back to the racial problem.



Always and everywhere the following are ultimately caused by a lack of consideration for the interests of the race of one's own nation or the  failure to recognize the danger of the foreign races within the national body:
- questions of general law, or
- monstrous excrescences in economic life
- cultural decline
- political degeneration
- defects in the school-system 
- the evil influence of the Press over the adult population

<!-- That is why all attempts at reform, all institutions for social relief, all political striving, all economic progress and all apparent increase in the general stock of knowledge, were doomed to be unproductive of any significant results. The nation, as well as the organization which enables it to exist--namely, the State--were not developing in inner strength and stability, but, on the contrary, were visibly losing their vitality. 

The false brilliance of the Second Empire could not disguise the inner weakness. And every attempt to invigorate it anew failed because the main and most important problem was left out of consideration.

It would be a mistake to think that the followers of the various political parties which tried to doctor the condition of the German people, or even all their leaders, were bad in themselves or meant wrong. Their activity even at best was doomed to fail, merely because of the fact that they saw nothing but the symptoms of our general malady and they tried to doctor the symptoms while they overlooked the real cause of the disease.  

If one makes a methodical study of the lines along which the old Empire developed one cannot help seeing, after a careful political analysis, that a process of inner degeneration had already set in even at the time when the united Empire was formed and the German nation began to make rapid external progress. 

The general situation was declining, in spite of the apparent political success and in spite of the increasing economic wealth. At the elections to the Reichstag the growing number of Marxist votes indicated that the internal breakdown and the political collapse were then rapidly
approaching.  -->

All the victories of the so-called bourgeois parties were fruitless because:
- they could not prevent the numerical increase of the Marxist votes
<!-- - , even when the bourgeois parties triumphed at the polls, but mainly because  -->
- they themselves were already infected with the germs of decay. 


Though unaware of it, the bourgeois world was infected from within with the deadly virus of Marxist ideas.

<!-- The fact that they sometimes openly resisted was to be explained by the competitive strife among ambitious political leaders, rather than by attributing it to any opposition in principle between adversaries who were determined to fight one another to the bitter end.  -->

During all those years only one protagonist was fighting with steadfast perseverance -- the Jew. 

The Star of David steadily ascended as the will to national self-preservation declined.

Therefore it was not a solid national phalanx that, of itself and out of its own feeling of solidarity, rushed to the battlefields in August 1914. 

<!-- But it was rather the manifestation of the last flicker from the instinct of national self-preservation against the progress of the paralysis with which the pacifist and Marxist doctrine threatened our people. 

Even in those days when the destinies of the nation were in the balance the internal enemy was not recognized; therefore all efforts to resist the external enemy were bound to be in vain. Providence did not grant the reward to the victorious sword, but followed the eternal law of retributive justice. 

A profound recognition of all this was the source of those principles and tendencies which inspire our new movement. We were convinced that only by recognizing such truths could we stop the national decline in Germany and lay a granite foundation on which the State could again be built up, a State which would not be a piece of mechanism alien to our people, constituted for economic purposes and interests, but an organism created from the soul of the people themselves. -->

### Notes

[Note 15. When Mephistopheles first appears to Faust, in the latter's study, Faust inquires: "What is thy name?" To which Mephistopheles replies: "A part ofthe Power which always wills the Bad and always works the Good." And when Faust asks him what is meant by this riddle and why he should call himself'a part,' the gist of Mephistopheles' reply is that he is the Spirit of Negation and exists through opposition to the positive Truth and Order and Beauty which proceed from the never-ending creative energy of the Deity. In the Prologue to Faust the Lord declares that man's active nature would grow sluggishin working the good and that therefore he has to be aroused by the Spirit of Opposition. This Spirit wills the Bad, but of itself it can do nothing positive, and by its opposition always works the opposite of what it wills.]
