Marxism's final objective is the destruction of all non-Jewish national States. 

It witnessed in July 1914 how the German working classes, which it had been inveigling, were aroused by the national spirit and rapidly ranged themselves on the side of the Fatherland. 

Within a few days, the deceptive smoke-screen of that infamous national betrayal had vanished into thin air and the Jewish bosses suddenly found themselves alone and deserted.

It was as if not a vestige had been left of that folly and madness with which the masses of the German people had been inoculated for sixty years. That was indeed an evil day for the
betrayers of German Labour. 

The moment, however, that the leaders realized the danger which threatened them they pulled the magic cap of deceit over their ears and, without being identified, played the part of mimes in the national reawakening.

The time seemed to have arrived for proceeding against the whole Jewish gang of public pests. Then it was that action should have been taken regardless of any consequent whining or protestation. At one stroke, in the August of 1914, all the empty nonsense about international solidarity was knocked out of the heads of the German working classes. 

A few weeks later, instead of this stupid talk sounding in their ears, they heard the noise of American-manufactured shrapnel bursting above the heads of the marching columns, as a symbol of international comradeship. Now that the German worker had rediscovered the road to nationhood, it should have been the duty of any Government which had the care of the people in its keeping, to take this opportunity of mercilessly rooting out everything that was opposed to the national spirit. 

While the flower of the nation's manhood was dying at the front, there was time enough at home at least to exterminate this vermin. But, instead of doing so, His Majesty the Kaiser held out his hand to these hoary criminals, thus assuring them his protection and allowing them to regain their mental composure.

And so the viper could begin his work again. This time, however, more carefully than before, but still more destructively. While honest people dreamt of reconciliation these perjured criminals were making preparations for a revolution.
Naturally I was distressed at the half-measures which were adopted at that time.

But I never thought it possible that the final consequences could have been so disastrous?

But what should have been done then? Throw the ringleaders into gaol, prosecute them and rid the nation of them? Uncompromising military measures should have been adopted to root out the evil. Parties should have been abolished and the Reichstag brought to its senses at the point of the bayonet, if necessary. 

It would have been still better if the Reichstag had been dissolved immediately. Just as the Republic to-day dissolves the parties when it wants to, so in those days there was even more justification for applying that measure, seeing that the very existence of the nation was at stake. 

Of course this suggestion would give rise to the question: Is it possible to eradicate ideas by force of arms? Could a WELTANSCHAUUNG be attacked by means of physical force?

At that time I turned these questions over and over again in my mind. By studying analogous cases, exemplified in history, particularly those which had arisen from religious circumstances, I came to the following fundamental conclusion:

Ideas and philosophical systems as well as movements grounded on a definite spiritual foundation, whether true or not, can never be broken by the use of force after a certain stage, except on one condition: namely, that this use of force is in the service of a new idea or WELTANSCHAUUNG which burns with a new flame.

The application of force alone, without moral support based on a spiritual concept, can
never bring about the destruction of an idea or arrest the propagation of it, unless one is
ready and able ruthlessly to exterminate the last upholders of that idea even to a man,
and also wipe out any tradition which it may tend to leave behind. 

Now in the majority of cases the result of such a course has been to exclude such a State, either temporarily
or for ever, from the comity of States that are of political significance; but experience has
also shown that such a sanguinary method of extirpation arouses the better section of
the population under the persecuting power. 

Every persecution which has no spiritual motives to support it is morally unjust and raises opposition
among the best elements of the population; so much so that these are driven more and
more to champion the ideas that are unjustly persecuted. With many individuals this
arises from the sheer spirit of opposition to every attempt at suppressing spiritual
things by brute force.

In this way the number of convinced adherents of the persecuted doctrine increases as the persecution progresses. Hence the total destruction of a new doctrine can be accomplished only by a vast plan of extermination; but this, in the final analysis, means the loss of some of the best blood in a nation or State. 

That blood is then avenged, because such an internal and total clean-up brings about the collapse of the nation's
strength. 

And such a procedure is always condemned to futility from the very start if the attacked doctrine should happen to have spread beyond a small circle. 

That is why in this case, as with all other growths, the doctrine can be exterminated in its earliest stages. As time goes on its powers of resistance increase, until at the approach of age it gives way to younger elements, but under another form and from other motives.

The fact remains that nearly all attempts to exterminate a doctrine, without having
some spiritual basis of attack against it, and also to wipe out all the organizations it has
created, have led in many cases to the very opposite being achieved; and that for the
following reasons:

When sheer force is used to combat the spread of a doctrine, then that force must be
employed systematically and persistently. This means that the chances of success in the
suppression of a doctrine lie only in the persistent and uniform application of the
methods chosen. The moment hesitation is shown, and periods of tolerance alternate
with the application of force, the doctrine against which these measures are directed
will not only recover strength but every successive persecution will bring to its support
new adherents who have been shocked by the oppressive methods employed. The old
adherents will become more embittered and their allegiance will thereby be
strengthened. Therefore when force is employed success is dependent on the consistent
manner in which it is used. This persistence, however, is nothing less than the product
of definite spiritual convictions. Every form of force that is not supported by a spiritual
backing will be always indecisive and uncertain. Such a force lacks the stability that can
be found only in a WELTANSCHAUUNG which has devoted champions. Such a force
is the expression of the individual energies; therefore it is from time to time dependent
on the change of persons in whose hands it is employed and also on their characters
and capacities.

But there is something else to be said: Every WELTANSCHAUUNG, whether religious
or political--and it is sometimes difficult to say where the one ends and the other 
begins--fights not so much for the negative destruction of the opposing world of ideas
as for the positive realization of its own ideas. Thus its struggle lies in attack rather than
in defence. It has the advantage of knowing where its objective lies, as this objective
represents the realization of its own ideas. Inversely, it is difficult to say when the
negative aim for the destruction of a hostile doctrine is reached and secured. For this
reason alone a WELTANSCHAUUNG which is of an aggressive character is more
definite in plan and more powerful and decisive in action than a
WELTANSCHAUUNG which takes up a merely defensive attitude. If force be used to
combat a spiritual power, that force remains a defensive measure only so long as the
wielders of it are not the standard-bearers and apostles of a new spiritual doctrine.
To sum up, the following must be borne in mind: That every attempt to combat a
WELTANSCHAUUNG by means of force will turn out futile in the end if the struggle
fails to take the form of an offensive for the establishment of an entirely new spiritual
order of' things. It is only in the struggle between two Weltan-schauungen that physical
force, consistently and ruthlessly applied, will eventually turn the scales in its own
favour. It was here that the fight against Marxism had hitherto failed.
This was also the reason why Bismarck's anti-socialist legislation failed and was bound
to fail in the long run, despite everything. It lacked the basis of a new
WELTANSCHAUUNG for whose development and extension the struggle might have
been taken up. To say that the serving up of drivel about a so-called 'State-Authority' or
'Law-and-Order' was an adequate foundation for the spiritual driving force in a life-ordeath struggle is only what one would expect to hear from the wiseacres in high official
positions.

It was because there were no adequate spiritual motives back of this offensive that Bismarck was compelled to hand over the administration of his socialist legislative measures to the judgment and approval of those circles which were themselves the product of the Marxist teaching.

Thus a very ludicrous state of affairs prevailed when the Iron Chancellor surrendered the fate of his struggle against Marxism to the goodwill of the bourgeois democracy. He left the goat to take care of the garden. 

But this was only the necessary result of the failure to find a fundamentally new WELTANSCHAUUNG which would attract devoted champions to its cause and could be established on the ground from which Marxism had been driven out. And thus the result of the Bismarckian campaign was deplorable. During the World War, or at the beginning of it, were the conditions any different? Unfortunately, they were not.

The more I then pondered over the necessity for a change in the attitude of the executive government towards Social-Democracy, as the incorporation of contemporary Marxism, the more I realized the want of a practical substitute for this doctrine.

Supposing Social-Democracy were overthrown, what had one to offer the masses in its stead? Not a single movement existed which promised any success in attracting vast numbers of workers who would be now more or less without leaders, and holding these workers in its train. 

It is nonsensical to imagine that the international fanatic who has just severed his connection with a class party would forthwith join a bourgeois party, or, in other words, another class organization. 

For however unsatisfactory these various organizations may appear to be, it cannot be denied that bourgeois politicians look on the distinction between classes as a very important factor in social life, provided it does not turn out politically disadvantageous to them. If they deny this fact they show themselves not only impudent but also mendacious.

One should guard against considering the broad masses more stupid than they really are. 

In political matters it frequently happens that feeling judges more correctly than intellect.

But the opinion that this feeling on the part of the masses is sufficient proof of their stupid international attitude can be immediately and definitely refuted by the simple fact that pacifist democracy is no less fatuous, though it draws its supporters almost exclusively from bourgeois circles.

As long as millions of citizens daily gulp down what the social-democratic Press tells them, it ill becomes the 'Masters' to joke at the expense of the 'Comrades'; for in the long run they all swallow the same hash, even though it be dished up with different spices. In both cases the cook is one and the same--the Jew.

One should be careful about contradicting established facts. It is an undeniable fact that 

The class question has nothing to do with questions concerning idealsm though that dope is administered at election time.

The following are obvious:
- class arrogance among our people
- the tendency to look down on the manual labourer

 <!-- are obvious facts and not the fancies of some day-dreamer. -->

It shows how our intellectual circles are unable to grasp the circumstances that lead to the growth of such a Marxist plague.

<!--   fact that  which are incapable of preventing 

 as  are certainly not capable of restoring what has been lost. -->

The bourgeois' parties--a name coined by themselves--will never again be able to win over and hold the proletarian masses in their train. That is because two worlds stand opposed to one another here, in part naturally and in part artificially divided. 

These two camps have one leading thought, and that is that they must fight one another. But in such a fight the younger will come off victorious; and that is Marxism. 

In 1914 a fight against Social-Democracy was indeed quite conceivable. But the lack of any practical substitute made it doubtful how long the fight could be kept up. In this respect there was a gaping void.

Long before the War, I thought the same. 

That was why I could not decide to join any of the parties then existing.

During the World War my conviction was further confirmed by the manifest impossibility of fighting SocialDemocracy in anything like a thorough way: because for that purpose there should have been a movement that was something more than a mere 'parliamentary' party, and there was none such.

<!-- I frequently discussed that want with my intimate comrades. And it was then that I first
conceived the idea of taking up political work later on. As I have often assured my
friends, it was just this that induced me to become active on the public hustings after
the War, in addition to my professional work. And I am sure that this decision was
arrived at after much earnest thought.  -->
