The parliamentary principle of vesting legislative power in the decision of the majority:
- rejects the authority of the individual
- puts a numerical quota of anonymous heads in its place.

In doing so, it contradicts the aristrocratic principle, which is a fundamental law of nature.

In this decadent era, the aristrocratic principle is not as incorporated in the upper ten thousand. 

<!-- The devastating influence of this parliamentary institution might not easily be recognized by those who read the Jewish Press, unless the reader has learned how to think independently and examine the facts for himself.  -->

The parliamentary institution is primarily responsible for the crowded inrush of mediocre people into the field of politics.

This discourages men who have real leadership qualities from taking part in political life.

This is because these circumstances call for a man who can bargain for the favour of the majority, instead of a man who has a capacity for constructive statesmanship.

Thus, the situation will appeal to small minds and will attract them accordingly.

The narrower the mental outlook and knowledge in a political jobber, the more accurate is his estimate of his own political stock.

Thus, he will be all the more inclined to appreciate a system which does not demand creative genius or even high-class talent, but rather that crafty kind of sagacity which makes an efficient town clerk. 

He values this kind of small craftiness more than the political genius of a Pericles. 

Such a mediocrity does not even have to worry about responsibility for what he does.

This is because from the beginning, he knows that whatever be the results of his 'statesmanship' his end is already prescribed by the stars.

He will one day have to make room for another who is of similar mental calibre. 

<!-- For it is another sign of our decadent times that the number of eminent statesmen grows according as the calibre of individual personality dwindles.

That calibre will become smaller and smaller the more the individual politician has to depend on parliamentary majorities. 

A man of real political ability will refuse to be the beadle for a bevy of footling cacklers. They in their turn, being the representatives of the majority--which means the dunder-headed multitude--hate nothing so much as a superior brain.

For footling deputies it is always quite a consolation to be led by a person whose intellectual stature is on a level with their own. Thus each one may have the  opportunity to shine in debate among such compeers and, above all, each one feels that he may one day rise to the top.

If Peter be boss to-day, then why not Paul tomorrow?  -->


### The Majority Vote

This new invention of democracy is very closely connected with the cowardice of most of our political leaders. 

Whenever important decisions have to be made, they always have to hide behind the backs of the majority.

They wheedle the majority in order to get their sanction for whatever action. 

They must have accomplices in order to be able to shift responsibility to other shoulders whenever it is opportune to do so. 

That is the main reason why this kind of political activity is abhorrent to men of character and courage, while at the same time it attracts inferior types.

 <!-- for a person who is not willing to accept responsibility for his own actions, but is always seeking to be covered by something, must be classed among the knaves and the rascals.  -->

If a national leader comes from that lower class of politicians, the evil consequences will soon manifest themselves. 

Nobody will then have the courage to take a decisive step. 

<!-- They will submit to abuse and defamation rather than pluck up courage to take a definite stand. And thus nobody is left who is willing to risk his position and his career, if needs be, in support of a determined line of policy. -->

The majority can never replace the man. The majority represents not only ignorance but also cowardice.

100 blockheads do not equal 1 man of wisdom.

<!-- , so a hundred poltroons are incapable of any political line of action that requires moral strength and fortitude. -->

<!-- The lighter the burden of responsibility on each individual leader, the greater will be the number of those who, in spite of their sorry mediocrity, will feel the call to place their immortal energies at the disposal of the nation. 

They are so much on the tip-toe of expectation that they find it hard to wait their turn. 

They stand in a long queue, painfully and sadly counting the number of those ahead of them and calculating the hours until they may eventually come forward. 

They watch every change that takes place in the personnel of the office towards which their hopes are directed, and they are grateful for every scandal which removes one of the aspirants waiting ahead of them in the queue. 

If somebody sticks too long to his office stool they consider this as almost a breach of a sacred understanding based on their mutual solidarity. They grow furious and give no peace until that inconsiderate person is finally driven out and forced to hand over his cosy berth for public disposal. 

After that he will have little chance of getting another opportunity. Usually those placemen who have been forced to give up their posts push themselves again into the waiting queue unless they are hounded away by the protestations of the other aspirants. 

The result of all this is that, in such a State, the succession of sudden changes in public positions and public offices has a very disquieting effect in general, which may easily lead to disaster when an adverse crisis arises. 

It is not only the ignorant and the incompetent person who may fall victim to those parliamentary conditions, for the genuine leader may be affected just as much as the others, if not more so, whenever Fate has chanced to place a capable man in the position of leader.  -->


If there appears a superior leader, a joint front will be organized against him.

<!-- , particularly if that leader, though not coming from their ranks, should fall into the habit of intermingling with these illustrious nincompoops on their own level. They want to have only their own company and will quickly take a hostile attitude towards any man who might show himself obviously above and beyond them when he mingles in their ranks. Their instinct, which is so blind in other directions, is very sharp in this particular. -->

The inevitable result is that the intellectual level of the ruling class sinks steadily. 

One can easily forecast how much the nation and State are bound to suffer from such a condition of affairs, provided one does not belong to that same class of 'leaders'. 

The parliamentary r√©gime in the old Austria had this very archetype.

 <!-- of the institution as I have described it. -->

The Austrian Prime Minister was appointed by the King-Emperor. But this act of appointment merely gave practical effect to the will of the parliament. 

The huckstering and bargaining that went on in regard to every ministerial position showed all the typical marks of Western Democracy. 

<!-- The results that followed were in keeping with the principles applied.  -->

The intervals between the replacement of one person by another gradually became shorter, finally ending up in a wild relay chase. 

With each change, the quality of the 'statesman' in question deteriorated, until finally only the petty type of political huckster remained.

In such people the qualities of statesmanship were measured and valued according to the adroitness with which they pieced together one coalition after another.

In other words, their craftiness in manipulating the pettiest political transactions, which is the only kind of practical activity suited to the aptitudes of these representatives.

<!-- In this sphere Vienna was the school which offered the most impressive examples.

Another feature that engaged my attention quite as much as the features I have already spoken of was the contrast between the talents and knowledge of these representatives of the people on the one hand and, on the other, the nature of the tasks they had to face.

Willingly or unwillingly, one could not help thinking seriously of the narrow intellectual outlook of these chosen representatives of the various constituent nationalities, and one could not avoid pondering on the methods through which these noble figures in our public life were first discovered. 

It was worth while to make a thorough study and examination of the way in which the real talents of these gentlemen were devoted to the service of their country; in other words, to analyse thoroughly the technical procedure of their activities.  -->

The whole spectacle of parliamentary life became more and more desolate the more one penetrated into its intimate structure and studied the persons and principles of the system in a spirit of ruthless objectivity. 

It is very necessary to be strictly objective in the study of the institution whose sponsors talk of 'objectivity' in every other sentence as the only fair basis of examination and judgment. 

If one studied these gentlemen and the laws of their strenuous existence the results were surprising.

There is no other principle which turns out to be quite so ill-conceived as the parliamentary principle, if we examine it objectively.

In our examination of it we may pass over the methods according to which the election of the representatives takes place, as well as the ways which bring them into office and bestow new titles on them. 

Only to a tiny degree are public wishes or public necessities satisfied by the manner in which an election takes place; for everybody who properly estimates the political intelligence of the masses can easily see that this is not sufficiently developed to enable them to form general political judgments on their own account, or to select the men who might be competent to carry out their ideas in practice.

Whatever definition we may give of the term 'public opinion', only a very small part of it originates from personal experience or individual insight. 

The greater portion of it results from the manner in which public matters have been presented to the people through an overwhelmingly impressive and persistent system of 'information'. 

<!-- In the religious sphere the profession of a denominational belief is largely the result of education, while the religious yearning itself slumbers in the soul; so too the political opinions of the masses are the final result of influences systematically operating on human sentiment and intelligence in virtue of a method which is applied sometimes
with almost-incredible thoroughness and perseverance.

By far the most effective branch of political education, which in this connection is best expressed by the word 'propaganda', is carried on by the Press. 

The Press is the chief means employed in the process of political 'enlightenment'. It represents a kind of school for adults. This educational activity, however, is not in the hands of the State but in the clutches of powers which are partly of a very inferior character.  -->
