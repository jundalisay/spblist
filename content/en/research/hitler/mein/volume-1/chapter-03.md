GENERALLY, a man should not publicly take part in politics before 30 years old, except for those who are naturally gifted with extraordinary political abilities.

This is because until he reaches that age, his mental development will mostly consist in acquiring and sifting the knowledge necessary for a platform from to examine the different political problems.

 <!-- that arise from day to day and be able to adopt a definite attitude towards each.  -->

A man must first acquire a fund of general ideas and fit them together so as to form an organic structure of personal thought or outlook on life--a WELTANSCHAUUNG. 

Then he will have that mental equipment to form his own judgments on questions of the day.

<!-- He will have acquired those qualities that are necessary for consistency and steadfastness in the
formation of political opinions.  -->

Such a man is now qualified, at least subjectively, to join the political conduct of public affairs.

If a man enters political life without this equipment, then his stand might be wrong.

<!--  In the first place, he may find during
the course of events that the stand which he originally took in regard to some essential
question was wrong.  -->

He will now have to either:
- abandon his former position
- stick to it even if it is untenable

<!-- against his better knowledge and riper wisdom and after his reason and convictions have already proved it .  -->

If he abandons it, he will appear inconsistent and will lose the loyalty of his followers who will see him as lacking good judgment.

 <!-- to remain as loyal to his leadership as they were before.  -->

<!-- And, as regards the followers themselves, they may easily look upon their leader's change of policy as showing a lack
of judgment inherent in his character. 

Moreover, the change must cause in them a certain feeling of discomfiture VIS-Ã€-VIS those whom the leader formerly opposed.  -->

If he sticks to his error, the public will no longer support him. This very frequently happens today.

<!-- --then public pronouncements of the leader have no longer his personal persuasion to support them. And the more that is the case the defence of his cause will be all the more hollow and superficial. 

He now descends to the adoption of vulgar means in his defence. While he himself no longer dreams seriously of standing by his political protestations to the last--for no man will die in defence of something in which he does not believe--he
makes increasing demands on his followers. 

The greater be the measure of his own insincerity, the more unfortunate and inconsiderate become his claims on his party
adherents. Finally, he throws aside the last vestiges of true leadership and begins to
play politics. This means that he becomes one of those whose only consistency is their
inconsistency, associated with overbearing insolence and oftentimes an artful
mendacity developed to a shamelessly high degree. -->

Should such a person, to the misfortune of all decent people, succeed in becoming a parliamentary deputy, then his  political activity merely consists in keeping his job for himself and his family. 
- The more his wife and children are dependent on him, the more stubbornly will he fight to maintain the
representation of his parliamentary constituency. 

This is why his personal enemy is anyone who has political capacity. 

<!-- In every new movement he will apprehend the possible beginning of his own downfall. And everyone who is a better man than himself will appear to him in the light of a menace. 

I shall subsequently deal more fully with the problem to which this kind of parliamentary vermin give rise. -->

When a man has reached 30 years old, he has still more to learn. But what he learns will amplify his basic ideas.

It will fit organically so as to fill up the fundamental WELTANSCHAUUNG which he already has. This organic growth results from the constant assimilation of new ideas

<!-- What he learns anew will not imply the abandonment of principles already held, but rather a deeper
knowledge of those principles.  -->

Thus, his colleagues will never feel that they have been hitherto falsely led by him. 

On the contrary, their confidence is increased when they perceive that their leader's qualities are steadily developing.

 <!-- along the lines of an ; so that the followers look upon this process as signifying an enrichment of the doctrines in which they themselves believe, in their eyes every such development is a new witness to the correctness of that whole body of opinion which has hitherto been held. -->

A leader who has to abandon his own platform upon realizing his mistake can act with honour only when he can accept the final consequences of his error. 

In such a case he should refrain from taking public part in any further political activity.

<!-- Having once gone astray on essential things he may possibly go astray a second time. But, anyhow, he has no right whatsoever to expect or demand that his fellow citizens should continue to give him their support.  -->

<!-- How little such a line of conduct commends itself to  -->

But our public leaders nowadays do not do this. Instead, they resort to general corruption as a cabal.

 <!-- prevalent among the cabal which at the present moment feels itself called to political leadership.  -->

<!-- In the whole cabal there is scarcely one who is properly equipped for this task. -->

<!-- Although in those days I used to give more time than most others to the consideration of political question, yet I carefully refrained from taking an open part in politics. 

Only to a small circle did I speak of those things which agitated my mind or were the cause of constant preoccupation for me.  -->
