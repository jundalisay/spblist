Religion and Religious Societies
Article 136

of religious freedom.
(2) Enjoyment of civil and political rights and eligibility for public office shall be independent of religious
affiliation.
(3) No person shall be required to disclose his religious convictions. The authorities shall have the
right to inquire into a person’s membership of a religious society only to the extent that rights or duties
depend upon it or that a statistical survey mandated by a law so requires.
(4) No person may be compelled to perform any religious act or ceremony, to participate in religious
exercises or to take a religious form of oath.
Article 137
(1) There shall be no state church.
(2) The freedom to form religious societies shall be guaranteed. The union of religious societies within
the territory of the Reich shall be subject to no restrictions.
(3) Religious societies shall regulate and administer their affairs independently within the limits of the
law that applies to all. They shall confer their offices without the participation of the state or the civil
community.
(4) Religious societies shall acquire legal capacity according to the general provisions of civil law.
(5) Religious societies shall remain corporations under public law insofar as they have enjoyed that
status in the past. Other religious societies shall be granted the same rights upon application, if their
constitution and the number of their members give assurance of their permanency. If two or more
religious societies established under public law unite into a single organisation, it too shall be a
corporation under public law.
