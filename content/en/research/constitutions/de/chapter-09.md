### Article 92: Court organisation

The judicial power shall be vested in the judges; it shall be exercised by the Federal Constitutional
Court, by the federal courts provided for in this Basic Law and by the courts of the Länder.

Article 93
[Jurisdiction of the Federal Constitutional Court]
(1) The Federal Constitutional Court shall rule:
1.
on the interpretation of this Basic Law in the event of disputes concerning the extent of
the rights and duties of a supreme federal body or of other parties vested with rights of their own by
this Basic Law or by the rules of procedure of a supreme federal body;
2.
in the event of disagreements or doubts concerning the formal or substantive
compatibility of federal law or Land law with this Basic Law or the compatibility of Land law with
Page 25 of 46Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice
and the Federal Office of Justice ‒ www.gesetze-im-internet.de
other federal law on application of the Federal Government, of a Land government or of one
quarter of the Members of the Bundestag;
2a.
in the event of disagreements as to whether a law meets the conditions set out in
paragraph (2) of Article 72, on application of the Bundesrat or of the government or legislature of a
Land;
3. in the event of disagreements concerning the rights and duties of the Federation and the
Länder, especially in the execution of federal law by the Länder and in the exercise of federal
oversight;
4. on other disputes involving public law between the Federation and the Länder, between
different Länder or within a Land, unless there is recourse to another court;
4a.
on constitutional complaints, which may be filed by any person alleging that one of his
basic rights or one of his rights under paragraph (4) of Article 20 or under Article 33, 38, 101, 103
or 104 has been infringed by public authority;
4b.
on constitutional complaints filed by municipalities or associations of municipalities on the
ground that their right to self-government under Article 28 has been infringed by a law; in the case
of infringement by a Land law, however, only if the law cannot be challenged in the constitutional
court of the Land;
4c. on constitutional complaints filed by associations concerning their non-recognition as
political parties for an election to the Bundestag;
5. in the other instances provided for in this Basic Law.
(2) At the request of the Bundesrat, a Land government or the parliamentary assembly of a Land, the
Federal Constitutional Court shall also rule whether, in cases falling under paragraph (4) of Article 72,
the need for a regulation by federal law does not exist any longer or whether, in the cases referred to
in item 1 of paragraph (2) of Article 125a, federal law could not be enacted any longer. The Court’s
determination that the need has ceased to exist or that federal law could no longer be enacted
substitutes a federal law according to paragraph (4) of Article 72 or item 2 of paragraph (2) of Article
125a. A request under the first sentence is admissible only if a bill falling under paragraph (4) of Article 72 or the second sentence of paragraph (2) of Article 125a has been rejected by the German
Bundestag or if it has not been considered and determined upon within one year or if a similar bill has
been rejected by the Bundesrat.
(3) The Federal Constitutional Court shall also rule on such other matters as shall be assigned to it by
a federal law.

(2) The organisation and procedure of the Federal Constitutional Court shall be regulated by a federal
