Of the two main Chinese trends of thought, Confucianism
and Taoism, the latter is the one which is mystically oriented
and thus more relevant for our comparison with modern physics.
Like Hinduism and Buddhism, Taoism is interested in intuitive
wisdom, rather than in rational knowledge. Acknowledging
the limitations and the relativity of the world of rational
thinking, Taoism is, basically, a way of liberation from this
world and is, in this respect, comparable to the ways of Yoga
or Vedanta in Hinduism, or to the Eightfold Path of the Buddha.
In the context of Chinese culture, the Taoist liberation meant,
more specifically, a liberation from the strict rules of convention.
Mistrust of conventional knowledge and reasoning is stronger
in Taoism than in any other school of Eastern philosophy. It is
based on the firm belief that the human intellect can never
comprehend the Tao. In the words of Chuang Tzu,
The most extensive knowledge does not necessarily know
it; reasoning will not make men wise in it. The sages
have decided against both these methods.’
Chuang Tzu’s book is full of passages reflecting the Taoist’s
contempt of reasoning and argumentation. Thus he says,
A dog is not reckoned good because he barks well, and a
man is not reckoned wise because he speaks skilfully.2
and

Disputation is a proof of not seeing clearly.3
Logical reasoning was considered by the Taoists as part of the artificial world of man, together with social etiquette and
moral standards. They were not interested in this world at all,
but concentrated their attention fully on the observation of
nature in order to discern the ‘characteristics of the Tao’.
Thus they developed an attitude which was essentially scientific
and only their deep mistrust in the analytic method prevented
them from constructing proper scientific theories. Nevertheless,
the careful observation of nature, combined with a strong
mystical intuition, led the Taoist sages to profound insights
which are confirmed by modern scientific theories.
One of the most important insights of the Taoists was the
realization that transformation and change are essential features
of nature. A passage in the Chuang-tzu shows clearly how the
fundamental importance of change was discerned by observing
the organic world:

In the transformation and growth of all things, every bud
and feature has its proper form. In this we have their
gradual maturing and decay, the constant flow of trans-
formation and change.4

The Taoists saw all changes in nature as manifestations of
the dynamic interplay between the polar opposites yin and
yang, and thus they came to believe that any pair of opposites
constitutes a polar relationship where each of the two poles is
dynamically linked to the other. For the Western mind, this
idea of the implicit unity of all opposites is extremely difficult to
accept. It seems most paradoxical to us that experiences and
values which we had always believed to be contrary should
be, after all, aspects of the same thing. In the East, however,
it has always been considered as essential for attaining en-
lightenment to go ‘beyond earthly opposites’,5 and in China
the polar relationship of all opposites lies at the very basis of
Taoist thought. Thus Chuang Tzu says,
The ‘this’ is also ‘that’. The ‘that’ is also ‘this’ . . . That the
‘that’ and the ‘this’ cease to be opposites is the very
essence of Tao. Only this essence, an axis as it were, is
the centre of the circle responding to the endless changes.6
From the notion that the movements of the Tao are a 

continuous interplay between opposites, the Taoists deduced
two basic rules for human conduct. Whenever you want to
achieve anything, they said, you should start with its opposite.

Thus Lao Tzu:
In order to contract a thing, one should surely expand it
first.
In order to weaken, one will surely strengthen first.
In order to overthrow, one will surely exalt first.
‘In order to take, one will surely give first.’
This is called subtle wisdom.’
On the other hand, whenever you want to retain anything,
you should admit in it something of its opposite:
Be bent, and you will remain straight.
Be vacant, and you will remain full.
Be worn, and you will remain new.8
This is the way of life of the sage who has reached a higher
point of view, a perspective from which the relativity and polar
relationship of all opposites are clearly perceived. These
opposites include, first and foremost, the concepts of good
and bad which are interrelated in the same way as yin and
yang. Recognizing the relativity of good and bad, and thus of
aI! moral standards, the Taoist sage does not strive for the
good but rather tries to maintain a dynamic balance between
good and bad. Chuang Tzu is very clear on this point:
The sayings, ‘Shall we not follow and honour the right
and have nothing to do with the wrong?’ and ‘Shall we not
follow and honour those who secure good government
and have nothing to do with those who produce disorder?
show a want of acquaintance with the principles of
Heaven and Earth and with the different qualities of things.
It is like following and honouring Heaven and taking no
account of Earth; it is like following and honouring the
yin and taking no account of the.yang. It is clear that such
a course cannot be pursued.g
It is amazing that, at the same time when Lao Tzu and his
followers developed their world view, the essential features of

this Taoist view were taught also in Greece, by a man whose
teachings are known to us only in fragments and who was, and
still is, very often misunderstood. This Greek Taoist’ was
Heraclitus of Ephesus. He shared with Lao Tzu not only the
emphasis on continuous change, which he expressed in his
famous saying ‘Everything flows’, but also the notion that all
changes are cyclic. He compared the world order to ‘an ever-
living fire, kindling in measures and going out in measures’,1o
an image which is indeed very similar to the Chinese idea of
the Tao manifesting itself in the cyclic interplay of yin and
yang-
It is easy to see how the concept of change as a dynamic
interplay of opposites led Heraclitus, like Lao Tzu, to the dis-
covery that all opposites are polar and thus united. The way
up and down is one and the same,’ said the Greek, and ‘God
is day night, winter summer, war peace, satiety hunger.‘”
Like the Taoists, he saw any pair of opposites as a unity and
was well aware of the relativity of all such concepts. Again
the words of Heraclitus-‘Cold things warm themselves, warm
cools, moist dries, parched is made wet’12-remind us strongly
of those of Lao Tzu, ‘Easy gives rise to difficult . . . resonance
harmonizes sound, after follows before.‘13
It is surprising that the great similarity between the world
views of those two sages of the sixth century B.C. is not generally
known. Heraclitus is often mentioned in connection with
modern physics, but hardly ever in connection with Taoism.
And yet it is this connection which shows best that his world
view was that of a mystic and thus, in my opinion, puts the
parallels between his ideas and those of modern physics in the
right perspective.
When we talk about theTaoist concept of change, it is important
to realize that this change is not seen as occurring as a con-
sequence of some force, but rather as a tendency which is
innate in all things and situations. The movements of the Tao
are not forced upon it, but occur naturally and spontaneously.
Spontaneity is the Tao’s principle of action, and since human
conduct should be modelled on the operation of the Tao,
spontaneity should also be characteristic of all human actions. 

Acting in harmony with nature thus means for the Taoists
acting spontaneously and according to one’s true nature. It
means trusting one’s intuitive intelligence, which is innate in
the human mind just as the laws of change are innate in all
things around us.
The actions of the Taoist sage thus arise out of his intuitive
wisdom, spontaneously and in harmony with his environment.
He does not need to force himself, or anything around him, but
merely adapts his actions to the movements of the Tao. In
the words of Huai Nan Tzu,
Those who follow the natural order flow in the current of
the Tao.14
Such a way of acting is called wu-wei in Taoist philosophy; a
term which means literally ‘non-action’, and which Joseph
Needham translates as ‘refraining from activity contrary to
nature’, justifying this interpretation with a quotation from the
Chuang-tzu :
Non-action does not mean doing nothing and keeping
silent. Let everything be allowed to do what it naturally
does, so that its nature will be satisfied.15
If one refrains from acting contrary to nature or, as Needham
says, from ‘going against the grain of things’, one is in harmony
with the Tao and thus one’s actions will be successful. This is
the meaning of Lao Tzu’s seemingly so puzzling words, ‘By
non-action everything can be done.‘16
The contrast of yin and yang is not only the basic ordering
principle throughout Chinese culture, but is also reflected in
the two dominant trends of Chinese thought. Confucianism
was rational, masculine, active and dominating. Taoism, on
the other hand, emphasized all that was intuitive, feminine,
mystical and yielding. ‘Not knowing that one knows is best,’
says Lao Tzu, and ‘The sage carries on his business without
action and gives his teachings without words.“’ The Taoists
believed that by displaying the feminine, yielding qualities of
human nature, it was easiest to lead a perfectly balanced life

in harmony with the Tao. Their ideal is best summed up in a
passage from the Chuang-tzu which describes a kind of Taoist
paradise:
The men of old, while the chaotic condition was yet
undeveloped, shared the placid tranquillity which be-
longed to the whole world. At that time the yin and yang
were harmonious and still; their resting and movement
proceeded without any disturbance; the four seasons
had their definite times; not a single thing received any
injury, and no living being came to a premature end.
Men might be possessed of the faculty of knowledge,
but they had no occasion for its use. This was what is
called the state of perfect unity. At this time, there was
no action on the part of anyone-but a constant mani-
festation of spontaneity.18
