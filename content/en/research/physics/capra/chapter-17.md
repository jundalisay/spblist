To explain the symmetries in the particle world in terms of a
dynamic model, that is, one describing the interactions between
the particles, is one of the major challenges of present-day
physics. The problem, ultimately, is how to take into account
simultaneously quantum theory and relativity theory. The
particle patterns seem to reflect the ‘quantum nature’ of the
particles, since similar patterns occur in the world of atoms.
In particle physics, however, they cannot be explained as wave
patterns in the framework of quantum theory, because the
energies involved are so high that relativity theory has to be
applied. Only a ‘quantum-relativistic’ theory of particles,
therefore, can be expected to account for the observed
symmetries.
Quantum field theory was the ‘first model of that kind. It
gave an excellent description of the electromagnetic inter-
actions between electrons and photons, but it is much less
appropriate for the description of strongly interacting particles.
As more and more of these particles were discovered, physicists
soon realized that it was highly unsatisfactory to associate each
of them with a fundamental field, and when the particle world
revealed itself as an increasingly complex tissue of inter-
connected processes, they had to look for other models to
represent this dynamic and ever-changing reality. What was
needed was a mathematical formalism which would be able
to describe in a dynamic way &great variety of hadron
oatterns: their continual transformation into one another,
their mutual interaction through the exchange of other
particles, the formation of ‘bound states’ of two or more
hadrons, and their decay into various particle combinations.
All these processes, which are often given the general name

‘particle reactions’, are essential features of the strong inter-
actions and have to be accounted for in a quantum-relativistic
model of hadrons.
The framework which seems to be most appropriate for the
description of hadrons and their interactions is called ‘S-matrix
theory’. Its key concept, the ‘S matrix’, was originally proposed
by Heisenberg in 1943 and has been developed, over the past
two decades, into a complex mathematical structure which
seems to be ideally suited to describe the strong interactions.
The S matrix is a collection of probabilities for all possible
reactions involving hadrons. It derives its name from the fact
that one can imagine the whole assemblage of possible hadron
reactions arranged in an infinite array of the kind mathe-
maticians call a matrix. The letter S is a remainder of the
original name ‘scattering matrix’ which refers to collision-or
‘scattering’-processes, the majority of particle reactions.
In practice, of course, one is never interested in the entire
collection of hadron processes, but always in a few specific
reactions. Therefore, one never deals with the whole S matrix,


but only with those of its parts, or ‘elements’, which refer to the
processes under consideration. These are represented sym-
bolically by diagrams like the one above which pictures one of
the simplest and most general particle reactions: two particles,
A and B, undergo a collision to emerge as two different particles,
C and D. More complicated processes involve a greater number
of particles and are represented by diagrams like the following.

It must be emphasized that these S-matrix diagrams are very
different from the Feynman diagrams of field theory. They do
not picture the detailed mechanism of the reaction, but merely
specify the initial and final particles. The standard process
A+B+C+D, for example, might be pictured in field theory
as the exchange of a virtual particle V, whereas in S-matrix

theory, one simply draws a circle without specifying what goes
on inside it. Furthermore, the S-matrix diagrams are not space-
time diagrams, but more general symbolic representations of
particle reactions. These reactions are not assumed to take
place at definite points in space and time, but are described in
terms of the velocities (or, more precisely, in terms of the
momenta) of the incoming and outgoing particles.
This means, of course, that an S-matrix diagram contains
much less information than a Feynman diagram. On the other
hand, S-matrix theory avoids a difficulty which is characteristic
of field theory. The combined effects of quantum and relativity
theory make it impossible to localize an interaction between
definite particles precisely. Due to the uncertainty principle,
the uncertainty of a particle’s velocity will increase as its region
of interaction is localized more sharply,* and consequently,
the amount of its kinetic energy will be increasingly uncertain.
Eventually, this energy will become large enough for new
particles to be created, in accordance with relativity theory,
and then one can no longer be certain of dealing with the
original reaction. Therefore, in a theory which combines both
quantum and relativity theories, it is not possible to specify
the position of individual particles precisely. If this is done, as
in field theory, one has to put up with mathematical incon-
sistencies which are, indeed, the main problem in all quantum
field theories. S-matrix theory bypasses this problem by

specifying the momenta of the particles and remaining suffi-
ciently vague about the region in which the reaction occurs.
The important new concept in S-matrix theory is the shift of
emphasis from objects to events; its basic concern is not with
the particles, but with their reactions. Such a shift from objects
to events is required both by quantum theory and by relativity
theory. On the one hand, quantum theory has made it clear
that a subatomic particle can only be understood as a mani-
festation of the interaction between various processes of
measurement. It is not an isolated object but rather an occur-
rence, or event, which interconnects other events in a particular
way. In the words of Heisenberg:
[In modern physicsl, one has now divided the world not
into different groups of objects but into different groups
of connections . . . What can be distinguished is the kind
of connection which is primarily important in a certain
phenomenon . . . The world thus appears as a complicated
tissue of events, in which connections of different kinds
alternate or overlap or combine and thereby determine
the texture of the whole.’
Relativity theory, on the other hand, has forced us to conceive
of particles in terms of space-time: as four-dimensional patterns,
as processes rather than objects. The S-matrix approach com-
bines both of these viewpoints. Using the four-dimensional
mathematical formalism of relativity theory, it describes all
properties of hadrons in terms of reactions (or, more precisely,
in terms of reaction probabilities), and thus establishes an
intimate link between particles and processes. Each reaction
involves particles which link it to other reactions and thus
build up a whole network of processes.
A neutron, for example, may participate in two successive
reactions involving different particles; the first, say, a proton
and a z-, the second a Z- and a K+.The neutron thus inter-
connects these two reactions and integrates them into a larger
process (see diagram (a) opposite). Each of the initial and final
particles in this process will be involved in other reactions; the
proton, for example, may emerge from an interaction between a

K+ and a A (see diagram (b) above) ; the K+ in the original reac-
tion may be linked to a K-and a n0; then- to three more pions.
The original neutron is thus seen to be part of a whole net-
work of interactions; of a ‘tissue of events’,-all described by the
S matrix. The interconnections in such a network cannot be
determined with certainty, but are associated with probabilities.
Each reaction occurs with some probability, which depends
on the available energy and on the characteristics of the
reaction, and these probabilities are given by the various
elements of the S matrix.
This approach allows one to define the structure of a hadron
in a thoroughly dynamic way. The neutron in our network,
for example, can be seen as a ‘bound state’ of the proton and

the n- from which it arises, and also as a bound state of the
C- and the K+ into which it disintegrates. Either of these hadron
combinations, and many others, may form a neutron, and
consequently they can be said to be components of the
neutron’s ‘structure’. The structure of a hadron, therefore, is
not understood as a definite arrangement of constituent parts,
but is given by all sets of particles which may interact with
one another to form the hadron under consideration. Thus a
proton exists potentially as a neutron-pion pair, a kaon-lambda
pair, and so on. The proton also has the potential of disintegrating
into any of these particle combinations if enough energy is
available. The tendencies of a hadron to exist in various mani-
festations are expressed by the probabilities for the corres-
ponding reactions, all of which may be regarded as aspects of
the hadron’s internal structure.


By defining the structure of a hadron as its tendency to
undergo various reactions, S-matrix theory gives the concept
of structure an essentially dynamic connotation. At the same
time, this notion of structure is in perfect agreement with the
experimental facts. Whenever hadrons are broken up in
high-energy collision experiments, they disintegrate into
combinations of other hadrons; thus they can be said to ‘consist’
potentially of these hadron combinations. Each of the particles
emerging from such a collision will, in turn, undergo various
reactions, thus building up a whole network of events which
can be photographed in the bubble chamber. The picture on

page 267 and the ones in Chapter 15 are examples of such net-
works of reactions.
Although it is a matter of chance which network will arise
in a particular experiment, each network is nevertheless
structured according to definite rules. These rules are the
conservation laws mentioned before; only those reactions can
occur in which a well-defined set of quantum numbers is
conserved. To begin with, the total energy has to remain
constant in every reaction. This means that a certain combina-
tion of particles can emerge from a reaction only if the energy
carried into the reaction is high enough to provide the required
masses. Furthermore, the emerging group of .particles must
collectively carry exactly the same quantum numbers that
have been carried into the reaction by the initial particles.
For example, a proton and a X-, carrying a total electric charge
of zero, may be dissolved in a collision and rearranged to
emerge as a neutron plus a n”, but they cannot emerge as a
neutron and a z+, as this pair would carry a total charge of
+1.
The hadron reactions, then, represent a flow of energy in
which particles are created and dissolved, but the energy can
only flow through certain ‘channels’ characterized by the
quantum numbers conserved in the strong interactions. In
S-matrix theory, the concept of a reaction channel is more
fundamental than that of a particle. It is defined as a set of

quantum numbers which can be carried by various hadron
combinations and often also by a single hadron. Which com-
bination of hadrons flows through a particular channel is a
matter of probability but depends, first of all, on the available
energy. The diagram opposite, for example, shows an inter-
action between a proton and a n- in which a neutron is formed
as an intermediate state. Thus, the reaction channel is made
up first by two hadrons, then by a single hadron, and finally
by the initial hadron pair. The same channel can be made up,
if more energy is available, by a A-K0 pair, a Z--K+ pair, and
by various other combinations.
The notion of reaction channels is particularly appropriate
to deal with resonances, those extremely short-lived hadron
states which are characteristic of all strong interactions. They
are such ephemeral phenomena that physicists were first
reluctant to classify them as particles, and today the clarification
of their properties still constitutes one of the major tasks in
experimental high-energy physics. Resonances are formed in
hadron collisions and disintegrate almost as soon as they come
into being. They cannot be seen in the bubble chamber, but
can be detected due to a very special behaviour of reaction
probabilities. The probability for two colliding hadrons to
undergo a reaction-to interact with one another-depends
on the energy involved in the collision. If the amount of this
energy is modified, the probability will also change; it may
increase or decrease with increasing energy, depending on the
details of the reaction. At certain values of energy, however,
the reaction probability is observed to increase sharply; a
reaction is much more likely to occur at these values than at
any other energy. This sharp increase is associated with the
formation of a short-lived intermediate hadron with a mass
corresponding to the energy at which the increase is observed.
The reason why these short-lived hadron states are called
resonances is related to an analogy that can be drawn to the
well-known resonance phenomenon encountered in con-
nection with vibrations. In the case of sound, for example, the
air in a cavity will in general respond only weakly to a sound
wave coming from outside, but will begin to ‘resonate’, or
vibrate very strongly, when the sound wave reaches-a certain
frequency called the resonance frequency. The channel of a

hadron reaction can be compared to such a resonant cavity,
since the energy of the colliding hadrons is related to the
frequency of the corresponding probability wave. When this
energy, or frequency, reaches a certain value the channel
begins to resonate; the vibrations of the probability wave
suddenly become very strong and thus cause a sharp increase
in the reaction probability. Most reaction channels have several
resonance energies, each of them corresponding to the mass
of an ephemeral intermediate hadron state which is formed
when the energy of the colliding particles reaches the resonance
value.
In the framework of S-matrix theory, the problem of whether
one should call the resonances ‘particles’ or not does not
exist. All particles are seen as intermediate states in a network
of reactions, and the fact that the resonances live for a much
shorter period than other hadrons does not make them funda-
mentally different. In fact, the word ‘resonance’ is a very appro-
priate term. It applies both to the phenomenon in the reaction
channel and to the hadron which is formed during that
phenomenon, thus showing the intimate link between particles
and reactions. A resonance is a particle, but not an object.
It is much better described as an event, an occurrence or a
happening.
This description of hadrons in particle physics recalls to
mind the words of D. T. Suzuki quoted above:* ‘Buddhists
have conceived an object as an event and not as a thing or
substance.’ What Buddhists have realized through their
mystical experience of nature has now been rediscovered
through the experiments and mathematical theories of modern
science.
In order to describe all hadrons as intermediate states in a
network of reactions, one has to be able to account for the
forces through which they mutually interact. These are the
strong-interation forces which deflect, or ‘scatter’, colliding
hadrons, dissolve and rearrange them in different patterns, and
bind groups of them together to form intermediate bound
states. In S-matrix theory, as in field theory, the interaction

forces are associated with particles, but the concept of virtual
particles is not used. Instead, the relation between forces and
particles is based on a special property of the S matrix known
as ‘crossing’. To illustrate this property, consider the following
diagram picturing the interaction between a proton and a II -

If this diagram is rotated through 90°, and if we keep the
convention adopted previously,* that arrows pointing down-

wards indicate antiparticles, the new diagram will represent a
reaction between an antiproton (j3 and a proton (p) which
emerge from it as a pair of pions, the n+ being the antiparticle of
the n- in the original reaction.
The ‘crossing’ property of the S matrix, now, refers to the
fact that both these processes are described by the same
S-matrix element. This means that the two diagrams represent
merely two different aspects, or ‘channels’, of the same
reaction.** Particle physicists are used to switching from one
channel to the other in their calculations, and instead of rotating
the diagrams they just read them upwards or across from the

**ln fact, the diagram can be rbtated further, and individual lines can be ‘crossed’
to obtain different processes which are still described by the same 5matrix
element. Each element represents altogether six different processes, but only
the two mentioned above are relevant for our discussion of interaction forces.



left, and talk about the ‘direct channel’ and the ‘cross channel’.
Thus the reaction in our example is read as p+7t+p+n-
in the direct channel, and as p+p-+z-+z+ in the cross
channel.

The connection between forces and particles is established
through the intermediate states in the two channels. In the
direct channel of our exampl.e, the proton and the 7c- can
form an intermediate neutron, whereas the cross channel can
be made up by an intermediate neutral pion (x0). This pion


the intermediate state in the cross channel-is interpreted as
the manifestation of the force which acts in the direct channel
binding the proton and the rc- together to form the neutron.
Thus both channels are needed to associate the forces with
particles; what appears as a force in one channel is manifest
as an intermediate particle in the other.
Although it is relatively easy to switch from one channel to
the other mathematically, it is extremely difficult-if at all
possible-to have an intuitive picture of the situation. This is
because ‘crossing’ is an essentially relativistic concept arising
in the context of the four-dimensional formalism of relativity
theory, and thus very difficult to visualize. A similar situation
occurs in field theory where the interaction forces are pictured
as the exchange of virtual particles. In fact, the diagram showing
the intermediate pion in the cross channel is reminiscent of
the Feynman diagrams picturing these particle exchanges,*
and one might say, loosely speaking, that the proton and the
Z- interact ‘through the exchange of a fl. Such words are
often used by physicists, but they do not fully describe the
situation. An adequate description can only be given in terms
of direct and cross channels, that is, in abstract concepts which
are almost impossible to visualize.
In spite of the different formalism, the general notion of an
interaction force in S-matrix theory is quite similar to that in
field theory. In both theories, the forces manifest themselves
as particles whose mass determines the range of the force,**
and in both theories they are recognized as intrinsic properties
of the interacting particles; they reflect the structure of the
particles’ virtual clouds in field theory, and are generated by
bound states of the interacting particles in S-matrix theory.
The parallel to the Eastern view of forces discussed previously***
applies thus to both theories. This view of interaction forces,
furthermore, implies the important conclusion that all known
particles must have some internal structure, because only then
can they interact with the observer and thus be detected. In


* It should be remembered, however, that S-matrix diagrams are not space-time
diagrams but symbolic representations of particle reactions. The switching from
one channel to the other takes place in an abstract mathematical space.

the words of Geoffrey Chew, one of the principal architects of
S-matrix theory, ‘A truly elementary particle-completely
devoid of internal structure-could not be subject to any
forces that would allow us to detect its existence. The mere
knowledge of a particle’s existence, that is to say, implies that
the particle possesses internal structureY2
A particular advantage of the S-matrix formalism is the fact
that it is able to describe the ‘exchange’ of a whole family of
hadrons. As mentioned in the previous chapter, all hadrons
seem to fall into sequences whose members have identical
properties except for their masses and spins. A formalism
proposed originally by Tullio Regge makes it possible to treat
each of these sequences as a single hadron existing in various
excited states. In recent years, it has been possible to incorporate
the Regge formalism into the S-matrix framework where it has
been used very successfully for the description of hadron
reactions. This has been one of the most important develop-
ments in S-matrix theory and can be seen as a first step towards
a dynamic explanation of particle patterns.
The framework of the S matrix, then, is able to describe the
structure of hadrons, the forces through which they mutually
interact, and some of the patterns they form, in a thoroughly
dynamic way in which each hadron is understood as an
integral part of an inseparable network of reactions. The main
challenge, and so far unsolved problem, in S-matrix theory is
to use this dynamic description to account for the symmetries
which give rise to the hadron patterns and conservation laws
discussed in the previous chapter. In such a theory, the hadron
symmetries would be reflected in the mathematical structure
of the S matrix in such a way that it contains only elements
which correspond to reactions allowed by the conservation
laws. These laws would then no longer have the status of
empirical regularities but would be a consequence of the
S-matrix structure, and thus a consequence of the dynamic
nature of hadrons.
At present, physicists are trying to achieve this ambitious
aim by postulating several general principles which restrict the
mathematical possibilities of constructing S-matrix elements
and thus give the S matrix a definite structure. So far, three of


these general principles have been established. The first is
suggested by relativity theory and by our macroscopic ex-
perience of space and time. It says that the reaction probabilities
(and thus the S-matrix elements) must be independent of dis-
placements of the experimental apparatus in space and time,
independent of its orientation in space, and independent of
the state of motion of the observer. As discussed in the previous
chapter, the independence of a particle reaction with regard
to changes of orientation and displacements in space and time
implies the conservation of the total amount of rotation,
momentum and energy involved in the reaction. These
‘symmetries’ are essential for our scientific work. If the results
of an experiment changed according to where and when it
was performed, science in its present form would be impossible.
The last requirement, finally-that the experimental results
must not depend on the observer’s motion-is the principle
of relativity which is the basis of relativity theory.*
The second general principle is suggested by quantum
theory. It asserts that the outcome of a particular reaction can
only be predicted in terms of probabilities and, furthermore,
that the sum of the probabilities for all possible outcomes-
including the case of no interaction between the particles-
must be equal to one. In other words, we can be certain that
the particles will either interact with one another, or not. This
seemingly trivial statement turns out to be, in fact, a very
powerful principle, known under the name of ‘unitarity’, which
severely restricts the possibilities of constructing S-matrix
elements.
The third and final principle is related to our notions of cause
and effect and is known as the principle of causality. It states
that energy and momentum are transferred over spatial
distances only. by particles, and that this transfer occurs in
such a way that a particle can be created in one reaction and
destroyed in another only if the latter reaction occurs after
the former. The mathematical formulation of the causality
principle implies that the S matrix depends in a smooth way
on the energies and momenta of the particles involved in a
reaction, except for those values at which the creation of new


particles becomes possible. At those values, the mathematical
structure of the S matrix changes abruptly; it encounters what
mathematicians call a ‘singularity’. Each reaction channel
contains several of these singularities, that is, there are several
values of energy and momentum in each channel at which
new particles can be created. The ‘resonance energies’ men-
tioned before are examples of such values.
The fact that the S matrix exhibits singularities is a con-
sequence of the causality principle, but the location of the
singularities is not determined by it. The values of energy and
momentum at which particles can be created are different for
different reaction channels and depend on the masses and
other properties of the created particles. The locations of the
singularities thus reflect the properties of these particles, and
since all hadrons can be created in particle reactions, the
singularities of the S matrix mirror all the patterns and sym-
metries of hadrons.
The central aim of S-matrix theory is, therefore, to derive the
singularity structure of the S matrix from the general principles.
Up to now, it has not been possible to construct a mathematical
model which satisfies all three principles, and it may well be
that they are sufficient to determine all the properties of the S
matrix-and thus all the properties of hadrons-uniquely.*
If this turns out to be the case, the philosophical implications
of such a theory would be very profound. All three of the
general principles are related to our methods of observation
and measurement, that is, to the scientific framework. If they
are sufficient to determine the structure of hadrons, this would
mean that ‘the basic structures of the physical world are
determined, ultimately, by the way in which we look at this
world. Any fundamental change in our observational methods
would imply a modification of the general principles which
would lead to a different structure of the S matrix, and would
thus imply a different structure of hadrons.

Such a theory of subatomic particles reflects the impossibility
of separating the scientific observer from the observed pheno-

*This conjecture, known as the ‘bootstrap’ hypothesis, will be discussed in
more detail in the subsequent chapter.

mena, which has already been discussed in connection with
quantum theory,* in its most extreme form. It implies, ultimately,
that the structures and phenomena we observe in nature are
nothing but creations of our measuring and categorizing
mind.
That this is so is one of the fundamental tenets of Eastern
philosophy. The Eastern mystics tell us again and again that all
things and events we perceive are creations of the mind,
arising from a particular state of consciousness and dissolving
again if this state is transcended. Hinduism holds that all shapes
and structures around us are created by a mind under the
spell of maya, and it regards our tendency to attach deep
significance to them as the basic human illusion. Buddhists call
this illusion avidya, or ignorance, and see it as the state of a
‘defiled’ mind. In the words of Ashvaghosha,
When the oneness of the totality of things is not recognised,
then ignorance as well as particularisation arises, and all
phases of the defiled mind are thus developed . . . All
phenomena in the world are nothing but the illusory
manifestation of the mind and have no reality on their
own.3
This is also the recurring theme of the Buddhist Yogacara
school which holds that all forms we perceive are ‘mind only’;
projections, or ‘shadows’, of the mind:
Out of mind spring innumerable things, conditioned by
discrimination . . . These things people accept as an
external world . . . What appears to be external does not
exist in reality; it is indeed mind that is seen as multiplicity;
the body, property, and above-all these, I say, are
nothing but mind.4
In particle physics, the derivation of the hadron patterns from
the general principles of S-matrix theory is a long and arduous
task, and so far only a few small steps have been taken towards
achieving it. Furthermore, the theory in its present form
cannot be applied to the electromagnetic interactions that


give rise to the atomic structures and dominate the world of
chemistry and biology. Nevertheless, the possibility that the
hadron patterns will some day be derived from the general
principles, and thus be seen to depend on our scientific
framework, must be taken seriously. It is an exciting con-
jecture that this may be a general feature of particle physics
which will also appear in future theories of electromagnetic,
weak, and gravitational interactions. If this turns out to be
true, modern physics will have come a long way towards
agreeing with the Eastern sages that the structures of the
physical world are maya, or ‘mind only’.
S-matrix theory comes very close to Eastern thought not
only in its ultimate conclusion, but also in its general view of
matter. It describes the world of subatomic particles as a
dynamic network of events and emphasizes change and trans-
formation rather than fundamental structures or entities. In
the East, such an emphasis is particularly strong in Buddhist
thought where all things are seen as dynamic, impermanent
and illusory. Thus S. Radhakrishnan writes:
How do we come to think of things, rather than of pro-
cesses in this absolute flux? By shutting our eyes to the
successive events. It is an artificial attitude that makes
sections in the stream of change, and calls them things . . .
When we shall know the truth of things, we shall realise
how absurd it is for us to worship isolated products of the
incessant series of transformations as though they were
eternal and real. Life is no thing or state of a thing, bu It a
continuous movement or change.5
Both the modern physicist and the Eastern mystic thave
realized that all phenomena in this world of change and
transformation are dynamically interrelated. Hindus
Buddhists see this interrelation as a cosmic law, the law of
karma, but they are generally not concerned with any specific
patterns in the universal network of events. Chinese philosophy,
on the other hand, which also emphasizes movement and
change, has developed the notion of dynamic patterns which
are continually formed and dissolved again in the cosmic flow
of the Tao. In the I Ching, or Book of Changes, these patterns
have been elaborated into a system of archetypal symbols,
the so-called hexagrams.

The basic ordering principle of the patterns in the /Ching*
is the interplay of the polar opposites yin and yang. The yang
, the yin by a broken line
is represented by a solid line (I
I-1, and the whole system of hexagrams is built up
naturally from these two lines. By combining them in pairs,
four configurations are obtained,

and by adding a third line to each of these, eight ‘trigrams’
are generated :
In ancient China, the trigrams were considered to represent
all possible cosmic and human situations. They were given
names reflecting their basic characteristics-such as The
Creative’, The Receptive’, ‘The Arousing’, etc.-and they were
associated with many images taken from nature and from social
life. They represented, for example, heaven, earth, thunder,
water, etc., as well as a family consisting of father, mother,
three sons and three daughters. They were, furthermore,
associated with the cardinal points and with the seasons of the
year, and were often arranged as follows:

In this arrangement, the eight trigrams are grouped around
a circle in the ‘natural order’ in which they were generated,
starting from the top (where the Chinese always place the
south) and placing the first four trigrams on the left side of the
circle, the second four on the right side. This arrangement
shows a high degree of symmetry, opposite trigrams having
yin and yang lines interchanged.

In order to increase the number of possible combinations
further, the eight trigrams were combined in pairs by placing
one above the other. In this way, sixty-four hexagrams were
obtained, each consisting of six solid or broken lines. The
hexagrams were arranged in several regular patterns, among
which the two illustrated on the opposite page were the most
common; a square of eight times eight hexagrams, and a
circular sequence showing the same symmetry as the circular
arrangement of the trigrams.
The sixty-four hexagrams are the cosmic archetypes on
which the use of the I Ching as an oracle book is based.
For the interpretation of any hexagram, the various meanings

of its two trigrams have to be taken into account. For example,
when the trigram The Arousing’ is situated above the trigram
The Receptive’ the hexagram is interpreted as movement
meeting with devotion and thus inspiring enthusiasm, which
is the name given to it.
the Arousing
the Receptive
Enthusiasm
The hexagram for Progress, to give another example, represents
‘The Clinging’ above ‘The Receptive’ which is interpreted as
the sun rising over the earth and thus as a symbol of rapid,
easy progress.
the Clinging
~~
the Receptive
Progress
In the I Ching, the trigrams and hexagrams represent the
patterns of the Tao which are generated by the dynamic inter-
play of the yin and the yang, and are reflected in all cosmic and
human situations. These situations, therefore, are not seen as
static, but rather as stages in a continuous flow and change.
This is the basic idea of the Book of Changes which is expressed
in its very title. All things and situations in the world are subject
to change and transformation, and so are their images, the
trigrams and hexagrams. They are in a state of continual
transition; one changing into another, solid lines pushing
outwards and breaking in two, broken lines pushing inwards
and growing together.
Because of its notion of dynamic patterns, generated by
change and transformation, the I Ching is perhaps the closest
analogy to S-matrix theory in Eastern thought. In both systems,
the emphasis is on processes rather than objects. In S-matrix
theory, these processes are the particle reactions that give rise
to all the phenomena in the world of hadrons. In the I Ching,
the basic processes are called ‘the changes’ and are seen as
essential for an understanding of all natural phenomena:

The changes are what has enabled the holy sages to
reach all depths and to grasp the seeds of all things6
These changes are not regarded as fundamental laws imposed
on the physical world, but rather-in the words of Hellmut
Wilhelm-as ‘an inner tendency according to which develop-
ment takes place naturally and spontaneously’.7 The same can
be said of the ‘changes’ in the particle world. They, too, reflect
the inner tendencies of the particles which are expressed, in
S-matrix theory, in terms of reaction probabilities.
The changes in the world of hadrons give rise to structures
and symmetric patterns which are represented symbolically
by the reaction channels. Neither the structures nor the
symmetries are regarded as fundamental features of the
hadron world, but are seen as consequences of the particles’
dynamic nature, that is, of their tendencies for change and
transformation.
In the I Ching, too, the changes give rise to structures-the
trigrams and hexagrams. Like the channels of particle reactions,
these are symbolic representations of patterns of change. As
the energy flows through the reaction channels, the ‘changes’
flow through the lines of the hexagrams:
Alteration, movement without rest,
Flowing through the six empty places,
Rising and sinking without fixed law,
It is only change that is at work here!
In the Chinese view, all things and phenomena around us
arise out of the patterns of change and are represented by the
various lines of the trigrams and hexagrams. Thus the things in
the physical world are not seen as static, independent objects,
but merely as transitional stages in the cosmic process which
is the Tao:
The Tao has changes and movements. Therefore the lines
are called changing lines. The lines have gradations, there-
fore they represent things.9
As in the world of particles, the structures generated by the


changes can be arranged in various symmetric patterns, such
as the octagonal pattern formed by the eight trigrams, in
which opposite trigrams have yin and yang lines interchanged.
This pattern is even vaguely similar to the meson octet dis-
cussed in the previous chapter, in which particles and anti-
particles occupy opposite places. The important point, how:
ever, is not this accidental similarity, but the fact that both
modern physics and ancient Chinese thought consider change
and transformation as the primary aspect of nature, and see
the structures and symmetries generated by the changes as
secondary. As he explains in the introduction to his translation’
of the I Ching, Richard Wilhelm regards this idea as the funda-
mental concept of the Book of Changes:

The eight trigrams . . . were held to be in a state of continual
transition, one changing into another, just as transition
from one phenomenon to another is continually taking
place in the physical world. Here we have the fundamental
concept of the Book of Changes. The eight trigrams are
symbols standing for changing transitional states; they are
images that are constantly undergoing change. Attention
centers not on things in their state of being-as is chiefly
the case in the Occident-but upon their movements in
change. The eight trigrams therefore are not representa-
tions of things as such but of their tendencies in move-
ment.lO
In modern physics, we have come to see the ‘things’ of the
subatomic world in very much the same way, laying stress
upon movement, change and transformation and regarding
the particles as transient stages in an ongoing cosmic process.
