So far, our exploration of the world view suggested by modern
physics has repeatedly shown that the idea of ‘basic building
blocks’ of matter is no longer tenable. In the past, this concept
was extremely successful in explaining the physical world in
terms of a few atoms; the structures of the atoms in terms of
a few nuclei surrounded by electrons; and finally, the structures
of the nuclei in terms of two nuclear ‘building blocks’, the
proton and the neutron. Thus atoms, nuclei and hadrons were,
in turn, considered to be ‘elementary particles’. None of them,
however, fulfilled that expectation. Each time, these particles
turned out to be composite structures themselves, and
physicists hoped that the next generation of constituents would
finally reveal themselves as the ultimate components of matter.
On the other hand, the theories of atomic and subatomic
physics made the existence of elementary particles increasingly
unlikely. They revealed a basic interconnection of matter,
showing that energy of motion can be transformed into mass,
and suggesting that particles are processes rather than objects.
All these developments strongly indicated that the simple
mechanistic picture of basic building blocks had to be aban-
doned, and yet many physicists are still reluctant to do so.
The age-old tradition of explaining complex structures by
breaking them down into simpler constituents is so deeply
ingrained in Western thought that the search for these basic
components is still going on.
There is, however, a radically different school of thought in
particle physics which starts from the idea that nature cannot
be reduced to fundamental entities, such as elementary particles
or fundamental fields. It has to be understood entirely through 

its self-consistency, with its components being consistent both
with one another and with themselves. This idea has arisen in
the context of S-matrix theory and is known as the ‘bootstrap’
hypothesis. Its originator and main advocate is Geoffrey Chew
who, on the one hand, has developed the idea into a general
‘bootstrap’ philosophy of nature and, on the other, has used
it (in collaboration with other physicists) to construct specific
models of particles formulated in S-matrix language. Chew has
described the bootstrap hypothesis in several articles’ which
provide the basis for the following presentation.
The bootstrap philosophy constitutes the final rejection of
the mechanistic world view in modern physics. Newton’s
universe was constructed from a set of basic entities with
certain fundamental properties, which had been created by
God and thus were not amenable to further analysis. In one
way or another, this notion was implicit in all theories of
natural science until the bootstrap hypothesis stated explicitly
that the world cannot be understood as an assemblage of
entities which cannot be analysed further. In the new world
view, the universe is seen as a dynamic web of interrelated
events. None of the properties of any part of this web is funda-
mental; they all follow from the properties of the other parts,
and the overall consistency of their mutual interrelations
determines the structure of the entire web.
Thus, the bootstrap philosophy represents the culmination
of a view of nature that arose in quantum theory with the
realization of an essential and universal interrelationship,
acquired its dynamic content in relativity theory, and was
formulated in terms of reaction probabilities in S-matrix theory.
At the same time, this view of nature came ever closer to the
Eastern world view and is now in harmony with Eastern thought,
both in its general philosophy and in its specific picture of
matter.
The bootstrap hypothesis not only denies the existence of
fundamental constituents of matter, but accepts no funda-
mental entities whatsoever-no fundamental laws, equations
or principles-and thus abandons another idea which has
been an essential part of natural science for hundreds of years.
The notion of fundamental laws of nature was derived from
the belief in a divine lawgiver which was deeply rooted in the

Judaeo-Christian tradition. In the words of Thomas Aquinas:
There is a certain Eternal Law, to wit, Reason, existing in
the mind of Cod and governing the whole universe.*
This notion of an eternal, divine law of nature greatly influenced
Western philosophy and science. Descartes wrote about the
‘laws which Cod has put into nature’, and Newton believed
that the highest aim of his scientific work was to give evidence
of the ‘laws impressed upon nature by Cod’. To discover the
ultimate fundamental laws of nature remained the aim of
natural scientistsfor the three centuries following Newton.
In modern physics, a very different attitude has now developed.
Physicists have come to see that all their theories of natural
phenomena, including the ‘laws’ they describe, are creations
of the human mind; properties of our conceptual map of
reality, rather than of reality itself. This conceptual scheme is
necessarily limited and approximate,* as are all the scientific
theories and ‘laws of nature’ it contains. All natural phenomena
are ultimately interconnected, and in order to explain any one
of them we need to understand all the others, which is obviously
impossible. What makes science so successful is the discovery
that approximations are possible. If one is satisfied with an
approximate ‘understanding’ of nature, one can describe
selected groups of phenomena in this way, neglecting other
phenomena which are less relevant. Thus one can explain
many phenomena in terms of a few, and consequently under-
stand different aspects of nature in an approximate way without
having to understand everything at once. This is the scientific
method; all scientific theories and models are approximations
to the true nature of things, but the error involved in the
approximation is often small enough to make such an approach
meaningful. In particle physics, for example, the gravitational
interaction forces between particles are usually ignored, as
they are many orders of magnitude weaker than those of the
other interactions. Although the error caused by this omission
is exceedingly small, it is clear that the gravitational interactions
will have to be included in future, more accurate theories of
particles.
Thus physicists construct a sequence of partial and approxi-

mate theories, each of them being more accurate than the
previous one, but none of them representing a complete and
final account of natural phenomena. Like these theories, all
the ‘laws of nature’ they describe are mutable, destined to be
replaced by more accurate laws when the theories are improved.
The incomplete character of a theory is usually reflected in its
arbitrary parameters or ‘fundamental constants’, that is, in
quantities whose numerical values are not explained by the
theory, but have to be inserted into it after they have been
determined empirically. Quantum theory cannot explain the
value used for the mass of the electron, nor field theory the
magnitude of the electron’s charge, or relativity theory that of
the speed of light. In the classical view, these quantities were
regarded as fundamental constants of nature which did not
require any further explanation. In the modern view, their role
of ‘fundamental constants’ is seen as temporary and reflecting
the limitations of the present theories. According to the boot-
strap philosophy, they should be explained, one by one, in
future theories as the accuracy and scope of these theories
increase. Thus the ideal situation should be approached, but
may never be reached, where the theory does not contain
any unexplained ‘fundamental’ constants, and. where all its
‘laws’ follow from the requirement of overall self-consistency.
It is important to realize, however, that even such an ideal
theory must possess some unexplained features, although not
necessarily in the form of numerical constants. As long as it is
a scientific theory, it will require the acceptance, without
explanation, of certain concepts which form the scientific
language. To push the bootstrap idea further would lead
beyond science:
In the broad sense, the bootstrap idea, although fascinating
and useful, is unscientific . . . Science, as we know it, requires
a language based on some unquestioned framework.
Semantically, therefore, an attempt to explain all concepts
can hardly be called ‘scientific’.3
It is evident that the complete ‘bootstrap’ view of nature, in
which all phenomena in the universe are uniquely determined
by mutual self-consistency, comes very close to the Eastern

world view. An indivisible universe, in which all things and
events are interrelated, would hardly make sense unless it
were self-consistent. In a way, the requirement of self-con-
sistency, which forms the basis of the bootstrap hypothesis,
and the unity and interrelation of all phenomena, which are
so strongly emphasized in Eastern mysticism, are just different
aspects of the same idea. This close connection is most clearly
expressed in Taoism. For the Taoist sages, all phenomena in
the world were part of the cosmic Way-the Tao-and the
laws followed by the Tao were not laid down by any divine
lawgiver, but were inherent in its nature. Thus we read in the
Tao Te Ching :
Man follows the laws of earth;
Earth follows the laws of heaven;
Heaven follows the laws of Tao;
Tao follows the laws of its intrinsic nature.4
Joseph Needham, in his thorough study of Chinese science
and civilization, discusses at great length how the Western
concept of fundamental laws of nature, with its original im-
plication of a divine lawgiver, has no counterpart in Chinese
thought. ‘In the Chinese world view’, Needham writes, ‘the
harmonious cooperation of all beings arose, not from the orders
of a superior authority external to themselves, but from the
fact that they were all parts in a hierarchy of wholes forming a
cosmic pattern, and what they obeyed were the internal
dictates of their own natures.‘5
According to Needham, the Chinese did not even have a
word corresponding to the classical Western idea of a ‘law of
nature’. The term which comes closest to it is Ii, which the Neo-
Confucian philosopher Chu Hsi* describes as ‘the innumerable
vein-like patterns included in the Tao’.6 Needham translates
lias’principleoforganisation’andgivesthefollowingcomments:
In its most ancient meaning, it signified the pattern in
things, the markings of jade or fibres in muscle . . . It
acquired the common dictionary meaning ‘principle’,
but always conserved the undertone of ‘pattern’ . . . There

is ‘law’ implicit in it, but this law is the law to which parts
of wholes have to conform by virtue of their very existence
as parts of wholes . . . The most important thing about
parts is that they have to fit precisely into place with the
other parts in the whole organism which they compose.7
It is easy to see how such a view led the Chinese thinkers to
the idea which has only recently been developed in modern
physics, that self-consistency is the essence of all laws of
nature. The following passage by Ch’en Shun, an immediate
pupil of Chu Hsi who lived around A.D. 1200, gives a very
clear account of this idea in words which could be taken as
a perfect explanation of the notion of self-consistency in the
bootstrap philosophy:
Li is a natural and unescapable law of affairs and things . . .
The meaning of ‘natural and unescapable’ is that (human)
affairs and (natural) things are made just exactly to fit into
place. The meaning of ‘law’ is that the fitting into place
occurs without the slightest excess or deficiency . . . The
men of old, investigating things to the utmost, and searching
out Ii, wanted to elucidate the natural unescapableness
of (human) affairs and (natural) things, and this simply
means that what they were looking for was all the exact
places where things precisely fit together. Just that.8
In the Eastern view then, as in the view of modern physics,
everything in the universe is connected to everything else and
no part of it is fundamental. The properties of any part are
determined, not by some fundamental law, but by the properties
of all the other parts. Both physicists and mystics realize the
resulting impossibility of fully explaining any phenomenon, but
then they take different attitudes. Physicists, as discussed before,
are satisfied with an approximate understanding of nature. The
Eastern mystics, on the other hand, are not interested in
approximate, or ‘relative’ knowledge. They are concerned with
‘absolute’ knowledge involving an understanding of the totality
of Life. Being well aware of the essential interrelationship of the
universe, they realize that to explain something means, ulti-
mately, to show how it is connected to everything else. As this
is impossible, the Eastern mystics insist that no single pheno-
menon can be explained. Thus Ashvaghosha:

All things in their fundamental nature are not namable
or explicable. They cannot be adequately expresssed in
any form of language.g
The Eastern sages, therefore, are generally not interested in
explaining things, but rather in obtaining a direct non-intellectual
experience of the unity of all things. This was the attitude of
the Buddha who answered all questions about life’s meaning,
the origin of the world, or the nature of nirvana, with a ‘noble
silence’. The nonsensical answers of Zen masters, when asked
to explain something, seem to have the same purpose; to make
the student realize that everything is a consequence of all the
rest; that ‘explaining’ nature just means to show its unity;
that, ultimately, there is nothing to explain. When a monk
asked Tozan, who was weighing some flax, What is Buddha?
Tozan said, This flax weighs three pounds’;lO and when Joshu
was asked why Bodhidharma came to China, he replied, ‘An
oak tree in the garden.‘”
To free the human mind from words and explanations is one
of the main aims of Eastern mysticism. Both Buddhists and
Taoists speak of a ‘network of words’, or a ‘net of concepts’,
thus extending the idea of the interconnected web to the
realm of the intellect. As long as we try to explain things, we
are bound by karma: trapped in our conceptual network. To
transcend words and explanations means to break the bonds
of karma and attain liberation.


The world view of the Eastern mystics shares with the bootstrap
philosophy of modern physics not only an emphasis on the
mutual interrelation and self-consistency of all phenomena,
but also the denial of fundamental constituents of matter. In a
universe which is an inseparable whole and where all forms
are fluid and ever-changing, there is no room for any fixed
fundamental entity. The notion of ‘basic building blocks’ of
matter is therefore generally not encountered in Eastern
thought. Atomic theories of matter have never been developed
in Chinese thought, and although they have arisen in some
schools of Indian philosophy, they are rather peripheral to
Indian mysticism. In Hinduism, the notion of atoms is prominent
in the Jaina system (which is regarded as unorthodox since it
does not accept the authority of the Vedas). In Buddhist philo-



sophy, atomic theories have arisen in two schools of Hinayana
Buddhism, but are treated as illusory products of avidya by the
more important Mahayana branch. Thus Ashvaghosha states:
When we divide some gross (or composite) matter, we can
reduce it to atoms. But as the atom will also be subject to
further division, all forms of material existence, whether
gross or fine, are nothing but the shadow of particularisation
and we cannot ascribe any degree of (absolute or inde-
pendent) reality to them.‘*
The principal schools of Eastern mysticism thus agree with
the view of the bootstrap philosophy that the universe is an
interconnected whole in which no part is any more fundamental
than the other, so that the properties of any one part are
determined by those of all the others. In that sense, one might
say that every part ‘contains’ all the others and, indeed, a
vision of mutual embodiment seems to be characteristic of
the mystical experience of nature. In the words of Sri Aurobindo,
Nothing to the supramental sense is really finite; it is
founded on a feeling of all in each and of each in all.‘3
This notion of ‘all in each and each in all’ has found its most
extensive elaboration in the Avatamsaka school of Mahayana
Buddhism* which is often considered to be the final culmination
of Buddhist thought. It is based on the Avatamsaka Sutra,
traditionally believed to have been delivered by the Buddha
while he was in deep meditation after his Awakening. This
voluminous sutra, which has so far not been translated into
any Western language, describes in great detail how the world
is perceived in the enlightened state of consciousness, when
‘the solid outlines of individuality melt away and the feeling
of finiteness no longer oppresses us.‘14 In its last part, called
the Candavyuha, it tells the story of a young pilgrim, Sudhana,
and gives the most vivid account of his mystical experience of
the universe, which appears to him as a perfect network of
mutual relations, where all things and events interact with
each other in such a way that each of them contains, in itself,

all the others. The following passage from the sum, paraphrased
by D. T. Suzuki, uses the image of a magnificently decorated
tower to convey Sudhana’s experience:
The Tower is as wide and spacious as the sky itself. The
ground is paved with (innumerable) precious stones of all
kinds, and there are within theTower Iinnumerable) palaces,
porches, windows, staircases, railings, and passages, all of
which are made of the seven kinds of precious gems . . .
And within this Tower, spacious and exquisitely orna-
mented, there are also hundreds of thousands . . . of towers,
each one of which is as exquisitely ornamented as the
main Tower itself and as spacious as the sky. And all these
towers, beyond calculation in number, stand not at all in
one another’s way; each preserves its individual existence
in perfect harmony with all the rest; there is nothing here
that bars one tower being fused with all the others in-
dividually and collectively; there is a state of perfect
intermingling and yet of perfect orderliness. Sudhana,
the young pilgrim, sees himself in all the towers as well as
in each single tower, where all is contained in one and
each contains all.15
The Tower in this passage is, of course, a metaphor for the
universe itself, and the perfect mutual interfusion of its parts
is known in Mahayana Buddhism as ‘interpenetration’. The
Avatamsaka makes it clear that this interpenetration is an
essentially dynamic interrelation which takes place not only
spatially but also temporally. As mentioned previously,* space
and time are also seen as interpenetrating.
The experience of interpenetration in the state of enlighten-
ment can be seen as a mystical vision of the complete ‘boot-
strap’ situation, where all phenomena in the universe are
harmoniously interrelated. In such a state of consciousness,
the realm of the intellect is transcended and causal explanations
become unnecessary, being replaced by the direct experience
of the mutual interdependence of all things and events. The
Buddhist concept of interpenetration thus goes far beyond any


scientific bootstrap theory. Nevertheless, there are models of
subatomic particles in modern physics, based on the bootstrap
hypothesis, which show the most striking parallels to the views
of Mahayana Buddhism.
When the bootstrap idea is formulated in a scientific context,
it has to be limited and approximate, and its main approximation
consists in neglecting all but the strong interactions. Since these
interaction forces are about a hundred times stronger than
the electromagnetic ones, and many more orders of magnitude
stronger than weak and gravitational interactions, such an
approximation seems reasonable. The scientific bootstrap,
then, deals exclusively with strongly interacting particles, or
hadrons, and is therefore often called the ‘hadron bootstrap’.
It is formulated in the framework of S-matrix theory and its
aim is to derive all properties of hadrons and their interactions
uniquely from the requirement of self-consistency. The only
‘fundamental laws’ accepted are the general S-matrix principles
discussed in the previous chapter, which are required by our
methods of observation and measurement and thus constitute
the unquestioned framework necessary for all science. Other
properties of the S matrix may have to be postulated temporarily
as ‘fundamental principles’, but will be expected to emerge as
a necessary consequence of self-consistency in the complete
theory. The postulate that all hadrons form sequences described
by the Regge formalism* may he of that kind.
In the language of S-matrix theory, then, the bootstrap
hypothesis suggests that the full S matrix, and thus all the
properties of hadrons, can be determined uniquely from the
general principles because there is only one possible S matrix
consistent with all three of them. This conjecture receives
support from the fact that physicists have never come close
to constructing a mathematical model which satisfies the
three general principles. If the only consistent S matrix is the
one describing a// properties and interactions of hadrons, as
the bootstrap hypothesis assumes, the physicists’ failure to
construct a-consistent partial S matrix becomes understandable.
The phenomena involving hadrons are so complex that it is

by no means certain whether the complete self-consistent S
matrix will ever be constructed, but one can envisage a series
of partially successful models of smaller scope. Each of them
would be intended to cover only a part of hadron physics and
would therefore contain some unexplained parameters repre-
senting its limitations, but the parameters of one model may
be explained by another. Thus more and more hadron pheno-
mena may gradually be covered with ever-increasing accuracy
by a mosaic of interlocking models whose net number of
unexplained parameters will keep decreasing. The adjective
‘bootstrap’ is thus never appropriate for any individual model,
but can only be applied to a combination of mutually consistent
models, none of which is any more fundamental than the
others. As Chew has put it, ‘A physicist who is able to view any
number of different partially successful models without
favoritism is automatically a bootstrapper.’
A number of partial models of that kind already exist,
formulated in S-matrix language and describing certain aspects
of hadron phenomena. The most successful of them are the
so-called ‘dual models’ which make extensive use of the dual
description of hadron reactions in terms of direct and cross
channels.* These models incorporate, for the first time, two of
the three general principles** plus the crossing property of the
S matrix and the Regge formalism. They constitute so far the
most promising attempts at carrying out the bootstrap
programme.
The picture of hadrons which emerges from these bootstrap
models is often summed up in the provocative phrase, ‘every
particle consists of all other particles’. It must not be imagined,
however, that each hadron contains all the others in a classical,
static sense. Rather than ‘containing’ one another, hadrons
‘involve’ one another in the dynamic and probabilistic sense
of S-matrix theory, each hadron being a potential ‘bound state’
of all sets of particles which may interact with one another
to form the hadron under consideration.*** In that sense, all
hadrons are composite structures whose components are

again hadrons, and none of them is any more elementary than
the others. The binding forces holding the structures together
manifest themselves through the exchange of particles, and
these exchanged particles are again hadrons. Each hadron,
therefore, plays three roles: it is a composite structure, it may
be a constituent of another hadron, and it may be exchanged
between constituents and thus constitute part of the forces
holding a structure together. The concept of ‘crossing’ is crucial
for this picture. Each hadron is held together by forces associated
with the exchange of other hadrons in the cross channel, each
of which is, in turn, held together by forces to which the first
hadron makes a contribution. Thus, ‘each particle helps to
generate other particles, which in turn generate it.“’ The whole
set of hadrons generates itself in this way or pulls itself up, so to
say, by its ‘bootstraps’. The idea, then, is that this extremely
complex bootstrap mechanism is self-determining, that is, that
there is only one way in which it can be achieved. In other
words, there is only one possible self-consistent set of hadrons-
the one found in nature.
In the hadron bootstrap, all particles are dynamically composed
of one another in a self-consistent way, and in that sense can
be said to ‘contain’ one another. In Mahayana Buddhism, a
very similar notion is applied to the whole universe. This cosmic
network of interpenetrating things and events is illustrated in
the Avatamsaka Sutra by the metaphor of Indra’s net, a vast
network of precious gems hanging over the palace of the god
Indra. In the words of Sir Charles Eliot:
In the heaven of Indra, there is said to be a network of
pearls, so arranged that if you look at one you see all the
others reflected in it. In the same way each object in the
world is not merely itself but involves every other object
and in fact is everything else. ‘In every particle of dust,
there are present Buddhas without number.‘18
The similarity of this image with that of the hadron bootstrap
is indeed striking. The metaphor of Indra’s net may justly be
called the first bootstrap model, created by the Eastern sages
some 2,500 years before the beginning of particle physics.

Buddhists insist that the concept of interpenetration is not
comprehensible intellectually, but is to be experienced by an
enlightened mind in the state of meditation. Thus D. T. Suzuki
writes :
The Buddha [in the Gandavyuhal is no more the one who
is living in the world conceivable in space and time. His
consciousness is not that of an ordinary mind which must
be regulated according to the senses and logic . . . The
Buddha of the Gandavyuha lives in a spiritual world which ’
has its own rules.19
In modern physics, the situation is quite similar. The idea of
every particle containing all the others is inconceivable in
ordinary space and time. It describes a reality which, like the
one of the Buddha, has its own rules. In the case of the hadron
bootstrap, they are the rules of quantum theory and relativity
theory, the key concept being that the forces holding particles
together are themselves particles exchanged in the cross
channels. This concept can be given a precise mathematical
meaning, but is almost impossible to visualize. It is a specifically
relativistic feature of the bootstrap, and since we have no
direct experience of the four-dimensional world of space-time,
it is extremely difficult to imagine how a single particle can
contain all other particles and at the same time be part of
each of them. This, however, is exactly the view of the
Mahayana:
When the one is set against all the others, the one is seen
as pervading them all and at the same time embracing
them all in itself.”
The idea of each particle containing all the others has not
only arisen in Eastern mysticism, but also in Western mystical
thought. It is implicit, for example, in William Blake’s famous
lines :
To see a world in a grain of sand
And a heaven in a wild flower,
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,
And eternity in an hour.

Here again, a mystical vision has led to an image of the boot-
strap type; if the poet sees the world in a grain of sand, the
modern physicist sees the world in a hadron.
A similar image appears in the philosophy of Leibniz who
considered the world as being made of fundamental substances
called ‘monads’, each of which mirrored the whole universe.
This led him to a view of matter which shows similarities to
that of Mahayana Buddhism and to the hadron bootstrap.*
In his Monadology, Leibniz writes :
Each portion of matter may be conceived of as a garden
full of plants, and as a pond full of fishes. But each branch
of the plant, each member of the animal, each drop of its-
humors, is also such a garden or such a pond.21
It is interesting that the similarity of these lines to the
passages of the Avatamsaka Sutra mentioned before may stem
from an actual Buddhist influence on Leibniz. Joseph Needham
has argued 22 that Leibniz was well acquainted with Chinese
thought and culture through translations he received from
Jesuit monks, and that his philosophy might very well have
been inspired by the Neo-Confucian school of Chu Hsi with
which he was familiar. This school, however, has one of its
roots in Mahayana Buddhism, and in particular in the Avatamsaka
(Chinese: ha-yen) school of the Mahayana branch. Needham,
in fact, mentions the parable of Indra’s net of pearls explicitly
in connection with the Leibnizian monads.
A more detailed comparison of Leibniz’ notion of ‘mirroring
relations’ between monads with the idea of interpenetration in
the Mahayana seems to show,. however, that the two are
rather different, and that the Buddhist conception of matter
comes much closer to the spirit of modern physics than that
of Leibniz. The principal difference between the Monadology
and the Buddhist view seems to be that the Leibnizian monads
are fundamental substances which are seen as the ultimate
constituents of matter. Leibniz begins the Monadology with
the words, The monad of which we shall here speak is merely
*The parallels between Leibniz’ view of matter and the hadron bootstrap have
recently been discussed; see C. Gale, ‘Chew’s Monadology’, journal of History
of Ideas, vol. 35 (April-June 1974), pp. 339-48.

a simple substance, which enters into composites; simple,
that is to say, without parts.’ He goes on to say, ‘And these
monads are the true atoms of nature, and, in a word, the
elements of all things.‘23 Such a ‘fundamentalist’ view is in
striking contrast to the bootstrap philosophy, and is also totally
different from the view of Mahayana Buddhism which rejects
all fundamental entities or substances. Leibniz’ fundamentalist
way of thinking is also reflected in his view of forces which he
regards as laws ‘imprinted by divine decree’ and essentially
different from matter. ‘Forces and activity’, he writes, ‘cannot
be states of a merely passive thing like matter.‘” Again, this
is contrary to the views of modern physics and of Eastern
mysticism.
As far as the actual interrelation between the monads is
concerned, the main difference to the hadron bootstrap seems
to be that monads do not interact with each other; they ‘have
no windows’, as Leibniz says, and merely mirror one another.
In the hadron bootstrap, on the other hand, as in the Mahayana,
the emphasis is on the interaction, or ‘interpenetration’, of all
particles. Furthermore, the bootstrap and the Mahayana views
of matter are both ‘space-time’ views which see objects as
events whose mutual interpenetration can only be understood
if one realizes that space and time, too, are interpenetrating.
The bootstrap hypothesis is not yet firmly established and the
technical difficulties involved in its implementation are con-
siderable. Nevertheless, physicists already speculate about
extending the self-consistent approach beyond the description
of hadrons. In the present context of S-matrix theory, such an
extension is not possible. The framework of the S matrix has
been developed specifically to describe the strong interactions
and cannot beapplied to the rest of particle physics, the principal
reason being that it cannot accommodate the massless particles
which are characteristic of all the other interactions. To enlarge
the hadron bootstrap, therefore, a more general framework
will have to be found, and in this new framework some of the
concepts which are at present accepted without explanation
will have to be ‘bootstrapped’; they will have to be derived,
that is, from the overall self-consistency. According to Geoffrey
Chew, these might include our conception of macroscopic

space-time and, perhaps, even that of human consciousness:
Carried to its logical extreme, the bootstrap conjecture
implies that the existence of consciousness, along with
all other aspects of nature, is necessary for self-consistency
of the whole.25
This view, again, is in perfect harmony with the views of the
Eastern mystical traditions which have always regarded con-
sciousness as an integral part of the universe. In the Eastern
view, human beings, like all other life forms, are parts of an
inseparable organic whole. Their intelligence, therefore, implies
that the whole, too, is intelligent. Man is seen as the living
proof of cosmic intelligence; in us, the universe repeats over
and over again its ability to produce forms through which it
becomes consciously aware of itself.
In modern physics, the question of consciousness has arisen
in connection with the observation of atomic phenomena.
Quantum theory has made it clear that these phenomena
can only be understood as links in a chain of processes, the
end of which lies in the consciousness of the human observer.*
In the words of Eugene Wigner, ‘It was not possible to formulate
the laws of [quantum theory1 in a fully consistent way without
reference to consciousness.‘26 The pragmatic formulation of
quantum theory used by the scientists in their work does not
refer to their consciousness explicitly. Wigner and other
physicists have argued, however, that the explicit inclusion of
human consciousness may be an essential aspect of future
theories of matter.
Such a development would open exciting possibilities for a
direct interaction between physics and Eastern mysticism.
The understanding of one’s consciousness and of its relation
to the rest of the universe is the starting point of all mystical
experience. The Eastern mystics have explored various modes
of consciousness throughout centuries, and the conclusions
they have reached are often radically different from the ideas
held in the West. If physicists really want to include the nature
of human consciousness in their realm of research, a study of
Eastern ideas may well provide them with stimulating new
viewpoints.

Thus the future enlargement of the hadron bootstrap, with
the ‘bootstrapping’ of space-time and of human consciousness
it may require, opens up unprecedented possibilities which
may well go beyond the conventional framework of science:
Such a future step would be immensely more profound
than anything comprising the hadron bootstrap; we
would be obliged to confront the elusive concept of
observation and, possibly, even that of consciousness.
Our current struggle with the hadron bootstrap may thus
be only a foretaste of a completely new form of human
intellectual endeavor, one that will not only lie outside of
physics but will not even be describable as ‘scientific’.27
Where, then, does the bootstrap idea lead us?This, of course,
nobody knows, but it is fascinating to speculate about its
ultimate fate. One can imagine a network of future theo,ries
covering an ever-increasing range of natural phenomena with
ever-increasing accuracy; a network which will contain fewer
and fewer unexplained features, deriving more and more of its
structure from the mutual consistency of its parts. Some day,
then, a point will be reached where the only unexplained
features of this network of theories will be the elements of the
scientific framework. Beyond that point, the theory will no
longer be able to express its results in words, or in rational
concepts, and will thus go beyond science. Instead of a boot-
strap theory of nature, it will become a bootstrap vision of
nature, transcending the realms of thought and language;
leading out of science and into the world of acintya, the un-
thinkable. The knowledge contained in such a vision will be
complete, but cannot be communicated in words. It will be
the knowledge which Lao Tzu had in mind, more than two
thousand years ago, when he said:
He who knows does not speak,
He who speaks does not know.*8
