The philosophies to be described are religious in essence. 

Their main aim is the direct mystical experience of reality. Such an experience is religious by nature. 

<!--  they
are inseparable from religion.  -->

More than for any other Eastern tradition this is true for Hinduism*, where the connection between philosophy and religion is particularly strong. 

{{< n n="We define religion as those which are centered around Enki or Enlil or any other advanced beings, instead of the principles of Nature. And so by our defintion, Hinduism is not a religion, but Islam and Christianity are religions" >}}

It has been said that almost all thought in India is in a sense religious thought and Hinduism has not only influenced, throughout many centuries, India’s intellectual life, but almost completely determined her social and cultural life as well.

Hinduism cannot be called a philosophy, nor is it a well defined religion. It is, rather, a large and complex socio-religious
organism consisting of innumerable sects, cults and philosophical systems and involving various rituals, ceremonies and
spiritual disciplines, as well as the worship of countless gods and goddesses. 

The many facets of this complex and yet persistent and powerful spiritual tradition mirror the geographical, racial,
linguistic and cultural complexities of India’s vast subcontinent.

The manifestations of Hinduism range from highly intellectual philosophies involving conceptions of fabulous range and
depth to the nai’ve and childlike ritual practices of the masses.

If the majority of the Hindus are simple villagers who keep the popular religion alive in their daily worship, Hinduism has, on the other hand, brought forth a large number of outstanding spiritual teachers to transmit its profound insights.

The spiritual source of Hinduism lies in the Vedas, a collection of ancient scriptures written by anonymous sages, the so-
called Vedic ‘seers’. There are four Vedas, the oldest of them 

being the Rig Veda. Written in ancient Sanskrit, the sacred language of India, the Vedas have remained the highest
religious authority for most sections of Hinduism. In India, any philosophical system that does not accept the authority
of the Vedas is considered to be unorthodox. 

Each of these Vedas consists of several parts which were composed at different periods, probably between 1500 and
500 B.C. The oldest parts are sacred hymns and prayers. 

Subsequent parts deal with sacrificial rituals connected with the Vedic hymns, and the last, called the Upanishads, elaborate
their philosophical and practical content. The Upanishads contain the essence of Hinduism’s spiritual message. They
have guided and inspired India’s greatest minds for the last twenty-five centuries, in accordance with the advice given in
their verses : Taking as a bow the great weapon of the Upanishad,
One should put upon it an arrow sharpened by
meditation.

Stretching it with a thought directed to the essence of
That,
Penetrate that Imperishable as the mark, my friend.’
The masses of the Indian people, however, have received
the teachings of Hinduism not through the Upanishads, but
through a large number of popular tales, collected in huge
epics, which are the basis of the vast and colourful Indian
mythology. One of those epics, the Mahabharata, contains
India’s favourite religious text, the beautiful spiritual poem of
the Bhagavad Gita. The Gita, as it is commonly called, is a
dialogue between the god Krishna and the warrior Arjuna who
is in great despair, being forced to combat his own kinsmen
in the great family war which forms the main story of the
Mahabharata.

Krishna, disguised as Arjuna’s charioteer, drives the chariot right between the two armies and in this dramatic
setting of the battlefield he starts to reveal to Arjuna the most
profound truths of Hinduism. As the god speaks, the realistic
backgrouna of the war between the two families soon fades
away and it becomes clear that the battle of Arjuna is the
spiritual battle of man, the battle of the warrior in search of
enlightenment. Krishna himself advises Arjuna

Kill therefore with the sword of wisdom the doubt born
of ignorance that lies in thy heart. Be one in self-harmony,
in Yoga, and arise, great warrior, arise.2
The basis of Krishna’s spiritual instruction, as of all Hinduism,
is the idea that the multitude of things and events around us
are but different manifestations of the same ultimate reality.
This reality, called Brahman, is the unifying concept which
gives Hinduism its essentially monistic character in spite of the
worship of numerous gods and goddesses.
Brahman, the ultimate reality, is understood as the ‘soul’,
or inner essence, of all things. It is infinite and beyond all
concepts; it cannot be comprehended by the intellect, nor
can it be adequately described in words: ‘Brahman, beginning-
less, supreme: beyond what is and beyond what is not.‘3-
‘Incomprehensible is that supreme Soul, unlimited, unborn,
not to be reasoned about, unthinkable.‘4 Yet, people want to
talk about this reality and the Hindu sages with their charac-
teristic penchant for myth have pictured Brahman as divine
and talk about it in mythological language. The various aspects
of the Divine have been given the names of the various gods
worshipped by the Hindus, but the scriptures make it clear
that all these gods are but reflections of the one ultimate
reality :
This that people say, Worship this god! Worship that
god!-one after another-this is his‘[Brahman’s]
creation
indeed! And he himself is all the gods.5
The manifestation of Brahman in the human soul is called
Atman and the idea that Atman and Brahman, the individual
and the ultimate reality, are one is the essence of the Upanishads:
That which is the finest essence-this whole world has that
as its soul. That is Reality. That is Atman. That art thou.6
The basic recurring theme in Hindu mythology is the creation
of the world by the self-sacrifice of Cod-‘sacrifice’ in the
original sense of ‘making sacred’-whereby Cod becomes the
world which, in the end, becomes again God. This creative
activity of the Divine is called Ma, the play of God, and the
world is seen as the stage of the divine play. Like most of
Hindu mythology, the myth of Ma has a strong magical flavour.


Brahman is the great magician who transforms himself into the
world and he performs this feat with his ‘magic creative power’,
which is the original meaning of maya in the Rig Veda. The
word maya-one of the most important terms in Indian
philosophy-has changed’ its meaning over the centuries.
From the ‘might’, or ‘power’, of the divine actor and magician,
it came to signify the psychological state of anybody under
the spell of the magic play. As long as we confuse the myriad
forms of the divine /i/a with reality, without perceiving the
unity of Brahman underlying all these forms, we are under the
spell of maya.
Maya, therefore, does not mean that the world is an illusion,
as is often wrongly stated. The illusion merely lies in our point
of view, if we think that the shapes and structures, things and
events, around us are realities of nature, instead of realizing that
they are concepts of our measuring and categorizing minds.
Maya is the illusion of taking these concepts for reality, of
confusing the map with the territory.
In the Hindu view of nature, then, all forms are relative, fluid
and ever-changing maya, conjured up by the great magician
of the divine play. The world of maya changes continuously,
because the divine /i/a is a rhythmic, dynamic play. The dynamic
force of the play is karma, another important concept of
Indian thought. Karma means ‘action’. It is the active principle
of the play, the total universe in action, where everything is
dynamically connected with everything else. In the words of
the Cita, ‘Karma is the force of creation, wherefrom all things
have their life.”
The meaning of karma, like that of maya, has been brought
down from its original cosmic level to the human level where
it has acquired a psychological sense. As long as our view of
the world is fragmented, as long as we are under the spell of
maya and think that we are separated from our environment
and can act independently, we are bound by karma. Being
free from the bond of karma means to realize the unity and
harmony of all nature, including man, and to act accordingly.
The Cita is very clear on this point:
All actions take place in time by the interweaving of the
forces of nature, but the man lost in selfish delusion thinks
that he himself is the actor.

But the man who knows the relation between the forces
of Nature and actions, sees how some forces of Nature
work upon other forces of Nature, and becomes not their
slave.8

To be free from the spell of maya, to break the bonds of
karma means to realize that all the phenomena we perceive
with our senses are part of the same reality. It means to ex-
perience, concretely and personally, that everything, including
our own self, is Brahman. This experience is called moksha, or
‘liberation’ in Hindu philosophy and it is the very essence of
Hinduism.
Hinduism holds that there are innumerable ways of liberation.
It would never expect all its followers to be able to approach
the Divine in the same way and therefore it provides different
concepts, rituals and spiritual exercises for different modes of
awareness. The fact that many of these concepts or practices
are contradictory does not worry the Hindus in the least,
because they know that Brahman is beyond concepts and
images anyway. From this attitude comes the great tolerance
and inclusiveness which is characteristic of Hinduism.
The most intellectual school is the Vedanta which is based
on the Upanishads and emphasizes Brahman as a nonpersonal,
metaphysical concept, free from any mythological content.
In spite of its high philosophical and intellectual level, however,
the Vedantist way of liberation is very different from any school
of Western philosophy, involving as it does daily meditation
and other spiritual exercises to bring about the union with
Brahman.
Another important and influential method of liberation is
known as yoga, a word which means ‘to yoke’, ‘to join’, and
which refers to the joining of the individual soul to Brahman.
There are several schools, or ‘paths’ of yoga involving some
basic physical training and various mental disciplines designed
for people of different types and at different spiritual levels.
For the common Hindu, the most popular way of approaching
the Divine is to worship it in the form of a personal god or
goddess, The fertile Indian imagination has created literally
thousands of deities which appear in innumerable mani-
festations. The three most worshipped divinities in India today
are Shiva, Vishnu and the Divine Mother. Shiva is one of the


oldest Indian gods who can assume many forms. He is called
Mahesvara, the Great Lord, when he is represented as the
personification of the fullness of Brahman and he can also
impersonate many single aspects of the Divine, his most
celebrated appearance being the one as Nataraja, the King of
Dancers. As the Cosmic Dancer, Shiva is the god of creation
and destruction who sustains through his dance the endless
rhythm of the universe.
Vishnu, too, appears under many guises, one of them being
the god Krishna of the Bhagavad Gita. In general, Vishnu’s role
is that of the preserver of the universe. The third divinity of this
triad is Shakti, the Divine Mother, the archetypal goddess
representing in her many forms the female energy of the
universe.
Shakti also appears as Shiva’s wife and the two are often
shown in passionate embraces in magnificent temple sculptures
which radiate an extraordinary sensuousness of a degree
completely unknown in any Western religious art. Contrary to
most Western religions, sensuous pleasure has never been
suppressed in Hinduism, because the body has always been
considered to be an integral part of the human being and not
separated from the spirit. The Hindu, therefore, does not try
to control the desires of the body by the conscious will, but
aims at realizing himself with his whole being, body and mind.
Hinduism has even developed a branch, the medieval Tantrism,
where enlightenment is sought through a profound experience
of sensual love ‘in which each is both’, in accordance with the
words of the Upanishads:
As a man, when in the embrace of a beloved wife, knows
nothing within or without, so this person, when in the
embrace of the intelligent Soul, knows nothing within or
without.q
Shiva was closely associated with this medieval form of
erotic mysticism, and so were Shaktiand numerous other female
deities which exist in great numbers in Hindu mythology. This
abundance of goddesses shows again that in Hinduism the
physical and sensuous side of human nature, which has always
been associated with the female, is a fully integrated part of
the Divine. Hindu goddesses are not shown as holy virgins,

but in sensual embraces of stunning beauty.
The Western mind is easily confused by the fabulous number
of gods and goddesses which populate Hindu mythology in
their various appearances and incarnations. To understand
how the Hindus can cope with this multitude of divinities, we
must be aware of the basic attitude of Hinduism that in sub-
stance all these divinities are identical. They are all mani-
festations of the same divine reality, reflecting different aspects
of the infinite, omnipresent, and-ultimately-incomprehen-
sible k&man.
