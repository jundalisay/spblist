Buddhism arrived in China around the 1st century AD when Chinese culture was more than 2,000 years old.

Chinese philosophy had reached its culmination during the late Chou period (c. 500-221 B.C.), the golden age of Chinese philosophy, and from then on had always been held in the highest esteem.

From the beginning, this philosophy had two complementary
aspects. The Chinese being practical people with a highly
developed social consciousness, all their philosophical schools
were concerned, in one way or the other, with life in society,
with human relations, moral values and government. This,
however, is only one aspect of Chinese thought. Complementary
to it is that corresponding to the mystical side of the Chinese
character, which demanded that the highest aim of philosophy
should be to transcend the world of society and everyday life
and to reach a higher plane of consciousness. This is the plane
of the sage, the Chinese ideal of the enlightened man who has
achieved mystical union with the universe.

The Chinese sage, however, does not dwell exclusively on
this high spiritual plane, but is equally concerned with worldly
affairs. He unifies in himself the two complementary sides of
human nature-intuitive wisdom and practical knowledge,
contemplation and social action-which the Chinese have
associated with the images of the sage and of the king. Fully
realized human beings, in the words of Chuang Tzu, ‘by their
stillness become sages, by their movement kings’.’
During the sixth century B.C., the two sides of Chinese
philosophy developed into two distinct philosophical schools, 

Confucianism and Taoism. Confucianism was the philosophy
of social organization, of common sense and practical know’-
ledge. It provided Chinese society with a system of education
and with strict conventions of social etiquette. One of its main
purposes was to form an ethical basis for the traditional Chinese
family system with its complex structure and its rituals of
ancestor worship. Taoism, on the other hand, was concerned
primarily with the observation of nature and the discovery of
its Way, or Tao. Human happiness, according to the Taoists,
is achieved when men follow the natural order, acting spon-
taneously and trusting their intuitive knowledge.
These two trends of thought represent opposite poles in
Chinese philosophy, but in China they were always seen as
poles of one and the same human nature, and thus as com-
plementary. Confucianism was generally emphasized in the
education of children who had to learn the rules and con-
ventions necessary for life in society, whereas Taoism used to
be pursued by older people in order to regain and develop the
original spontaneity which had been destroyed by social
conventions. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the Neo-
Confucian school attempted a synthesis of Confucianism,
Buddhism and Taoism, which culminated in the philosophy of
Chu Hsi, one of the greatest of all Chinese thinkers. Chu Hsi
was an outstanding philosopher who combined Confucian
scholarship with a deep understanding of Buddhism and
Taoism, and incorporated elements of all three traditions in
his philosophical synthesis.
Confucianism derives its name from Kung Fu Tzu, or Confucius,
a highly influential teacher with a large number of students
who saw his main function as transmitting the ancient cultural
heritage to his disciples. In doing so, however, he went beyond
a simple transmission of knowledge for he interpreted the
traditional ideas according to his own moral concepts. His
teachings were based on the so-called Six Classics, ancient
books of philosophical thought, rituals, poetry, music and
history, which represented the spiritual and cultural heritage
of the ‘holy sages’ of China’s past. Chinese tradition has
associated Confucius with all of these works, either as author

commentator or editor; but according to modern scholarship
he was neither the author, commentator, nor even the editor
of any of the Classics. His own ideas became known through
the Lun Yij, or Confucian Analects, a collection of aphorisms
which was compiled by some of his disciples.
The originator of Taoism was Lao Tzu, whose name literally
means the ‘Old Master’ and who was, according to tradition,
an older contemporary of Confucius. He is said to have been
the author of a short book of aphorisms which is considered
as the main Taoist scripture. In China, it is generally just called
the Lao-tzu and in the West it is usually known as the Tao Te
Ching, the ‘Classic of the Way and Power’, a name which was
given to it in later times. I have already mentioned the para-
doxical style and the powerful and poetic language of this
book which Joseph Needham considers to be ‘without exception
the most profound and beautiful work in the Chinese language’.*
The second important Taoist book is the Chuang-tzu, a
much larger book than the Tao Te Ching, whose author,
Chuang Tzu, is said to have lived about two hundred years
after Lao Tzu. According to modern scholarship, however, the
Chuang-tzu, and probably also the Lao-tzu, cannot be seen as
the work of a single author, but rather constitute a collection
of Taoist writings compiled by different authors at different
times.
Both the Confucian Analects and the Tao Te Ching are written
in the compact suggestive style which is typical of the Chinese
way of thinking. The Chinese mind was not given to abstract
logical thinking and developed a language which is very
different from that which evolved in the West. Many of its
words could be used as nouns, adjectives or verbs, and their
sequence was determined not so much by grammatical rules
as by the emotional content of the sentence. The classical
Chinese word was very different from an abstract sign repre-
senting a clearly delineated concept. It was rather a sound
symbol which had strong suggestive powers, bringing to mind
an indeterminate complex of pictoriai images and emotions.
The intention of the speaker was not so much to express an
intellectual idea, but rather to affect and influence the listener.

Correspondingly, the written character was not just an abstract
sign, butLvas an organic pattern-a ‘gestalt’-which preserved
the full complex of images and the suggestive power of the
word.
Since the Chinese philosophers expressed themselves in a
language which was so well suited for their way of thinking,
their writings and sayings could be short and inarticulate, and
yet rich in suggestive images. It is clear that much of this
imagery must be lost in an English translation. A translation of
a sentence from the Tao Te Ching, for example, can only
render a small part of the rich complex of ideas contained in
the original, which is why different translations from this
controversial book often look like totally different texts. As
Fung Yu-Lan has said, ‘It needs a combination of all the trans-
lations already made and many others not yet made, to reveal
the richness of the Lao-&u and the Confucian Analects in
their original form.‘3
The Chinese, like the Indians, believed that there is an ultimate
reality which underlies and unifies the multiple things and
events we observe:
There are the three terms-‘complete’, ‘all-embracing’,
‘the whole’. These names are different, but the reality
sought in them is the same: referring to the One thing.4
They called this reality the Tao, which originally meant ‘the
Way’. It is the way, or process, of the universe, the order of
nature. In later times, the Confucianists gave it a different
interpretation. They talked about the Tao of man, or the Tao
of human society, and ‘understood it as the right way of life
in a inoral sense.
In its original cosmic sense, the Tao is the ultimate, undeftn-
able reality and as such it is the equivalent of the Hinduist
Brahman and the Buddhist Dharmakaya. It differs from these
Indian concepts, however, by its intrinsically dynamic quality
which, in the Chinese view, is the essence of the universe. The
Tao is the cosmic process in which all things are involved;
the world is seen as a continuous flow and change.
Indian Buddhism, with its doctrine of impermanence, had

quite a similar view, but it took this view merely as the basic
premise of the, human situation and went on to elaborate its
psychological consequences. The Chinese, on the other hand,
not only believed that flow and change were the essential
features of nature, but also that there are constant patterns in
these changes, to be observed- by man. The sage recognizes
these patterns and directs his actions according to them. In
this way, he becomes ‘one with the fao’, living in harmony
with nature and succeeding in everything he undertakes. In
the words of Huai Nan Tzu, a philosopher of the second century
B.C. :
He who conforms to the course of the Tao, following the
natural processes of Heaven and Earth, finds it easy to
manage the whole world.5
What, then, are the patterns of thecosmic Way which man
has to recognize? The principal characteristic of the Tao is the
cyclic nature of its ceaseless motion and change. ‘Returning
is the motion of the Tao,’ says Lao Tzu, and ‘Going far means
returning.‘6 The idea is that all developments in nature, those
in the physical world as well as those of human situations,
show cyclic patterns of coming and going, of expansion and
contraction.
This idea was no doubt deduced from the movements of
the sun and moon and from the change of the seasons, but it
was then also taken as a rule of life. The Chinese believe that
whenever a situation develops to its extreme, it is bound to
turn around and become its opposite. This basic belief has
in times of distress and
given them courage and perseverence
has made them cautious and modest in times of success. It
has led to the doctrine of the golden mean in which both
Taoists and Confucianists believe. ‘The sage’, says Lao Tzu,
‘avoids excess, extravagance and indulgence.”
In the Chinese view, it is better to have too little than to have
too much, and better to leave things undone than to overdo
them, because although one may not get very far this way
one is certain to go in the right direction. Just as the man who
wants to go further and further East will end up in the West,

those who accumulate more and more money in order to
increase their wealth will end up being poor. Modern industrial
society which is continuously trying to increase the ‘standard
of living’ and thereby decreases the quality of life for all its
members is an eloquent illustration of this ancient Chinese
wisdom.
The idea of cyclic patterns in the motion of the Tao was
given a definite structure by the introduction of the polar
opposites yin and yang. They are the two poles which set the
limits for the cycles of change:
The yang having reached its climax retreats in favour of
the yin; the yin having reached its climax retreats in favour
of the yang.8
In the Chinese view, all manifestations of the Tao are
generated by the dynamic interplay of these two polar forces.
This idea is very old and many generations worked on the
symbolism of the archetypal pair yin and yang until it became
the fundamental concept of Chinese thought. The original
meaning of the words yin and yang was that of the shady and
sunny sides of a mountain, a meaning which gives a good idea
of the relativity of the two concepts:
That which lets now the dark, now the light appear is
Tao.g
From the very early times, the two archetypal poles of nature
were represented not only by bright and dark, but also by male
and female, firm and yielding, above and below. Yang, the
strong, male, creative power, was associated with Heaven,
whereas yin, the dark, receptive, female and maternal element,
was represented by the Earth. Heaven is above and full of
movement, the Earth-in the old geocentric view-is below
and resting, and thus yang came to symbolize movement and
yin rest. In the realm of thought, yin is the complex, female,
intuitive mind, yang the clear and rational male intellect. Yin
is the quiet, contemplative stillness of the sage, yang the strong,
creative action of the king.
The dynamic character of yin and yang is illustrated by the

ancient Chinese symbol called rai-chi T’u, or ‘Diagram of the
Supreme Ultimate’:


This diagram is a symmetric arrangement of the dark yin and
the bright yang, but the symmetry is not static. It is a rotational
symmetry suggesting, very forcefully, a continuous cyclic
movement:
The yang returns cyclically to its beginning, the yin
attains its maximum and gives place to the yanglo
The two dots in the diagram symbolize the idea that each
time one of the two forces reaches its extreme, it contains
in itself already the seed of its opposite.
The pair of yin and yang is the grand leitmotiv that per-
meates Chinese culture and determines all features of the
traditional Chinese way of life. ‘Life’, says Chuang Tzu, ‘is the
blended harmony of the yin and yang.“’ As a nation of farmers,
the Chinese had always been familiar with the movements of
the sun and moon and with the change of the seasons. Seasonal
changes and the resulting phenomena of growth and decay in
organic nature were thus seen by them as the clearest expres-


In the Changes there are images to reveal, there are
judgements appended in order to interpret, good fortune
and misfortune are determined in order to decide.13
The purpose of consulting the I Ching was thus not merely
to know the future, but rather to discover the disposition of
the present situation so that proper action could be taken.
This attitude lifted the I Ching above the level of an ordinary
book of soothsaying and made it a book of wisdom.
The use of the I Ching as a book of wisdom is, in fact, of far
greater importance than its use as an oracle. It has inspired
the leading minds of China throughout the ages, among them
Lao Tzu, who drew some of his profoundest aphorisms from
this source. Confucius studied it intensively and most of the
commentaries on the text which make up the later strata of
the book go back to his school. These commentaries, the
so-called Ten Wings, combine the structural interpretation of
the hexagrams with philosophical explanations.
At the centre of the Confucian commentaries, as of the
entire I Ching, is the emphasis on the dynamic aspect of all
phenomena. The ceaseless transformation of all things and
situations is the essential message of the Book of Changes:
The Changes is a book
From which one may not hold aloof.
Its tao is forever changing-
Alteration, movement without rest,
Flowing through the six empty places,
Rising and sinking without fixed law,
Firm and yielding transform each other
They cannot be confined within a rule,
It is only change that is at work here.14


greatest and most significant in the three thousand years
of Chinese cultural history has either taken its inspiration
from this book, or has exerted’an influence on the inter-
pretation of its text. Therefore it may safely be said that
the seasoned wisdom of thousands of years has gone into
the making of the I Ching.l*
The Book of Changes is thus a work that has grown organically
over thousands of years and consists of many layers stemming
from the most important periods of Chinese thought. The
starting point of the book was a collection of sixty-four figures,
or ‘hexagrams’, of the following type, which are based on the
yin-yang symbolism and were used as oracles. Each hexagram
consists of six lines which may be either broken (yin) or un-
broken (yang), the sixty-four of them constituting all possible
combinations of that kind. These hexagrams, which will be
-
-
discussed in greater detail later on, were considered as cosmic
archetypes representing the patterns of the Tao in nature and
in human situations. Each of them was given a title and was
supplemented with a brief text, called the Judgement, to in-
dicate the course of action appropriate to the cosmic pattern
in question. The so-called Image is another brief text, added at
a later date, which elaborates the meaning of the hexagram
in a few, often extremely poetic lines. A third text interprets
each of the hexagram’s six lines in a language charged with
mythical images which are often difficult to understand.
These three categories of texts form the basic parts of the
book which were used for divination. An elaborate ritual
involving fifty yarrow stalks Was used to determine the hexagram
corresponding to the personal situation of the questioner. The
idea was to make the cosmic pattern of that moment visible
in the hexagram and to learn from the oracle which course of
action was appropriate to it:

sions of the interplay between yin and yang, between the cold
and dark winter and the bright and hot summer. The seasonal
interplay of the two opposites is also reflected in the food we
eat which contains elements of yin and yang. A healthy diet
consists, for the Chinese, in balancing these yin and yang
elements.
Traditional Chinese medicine, too, is based on the balance
of yin and yang in the human body, and any illness is seen as a
disruption of this balance. The body is divided into yin and yang
parts. Globally speaking, the inside of the body is yang, the
body surface is yin; the back is yang, the front is yin; inside
the body, there are yin and yang organs. The balance between
all these parts is maintained by a continuous flow of ch’i, or
vital energy, along a system of ‘meridians’ which contain the
acupuncture points. Each organ has a meridian associated
with it in such a way that yang meridians belong to yin organs
and vice versa. Whenever the flow between the yin and yang
is blocked, the body falls ill, and the illness is cured by sticking
needles into the acupuncture points to stimulate and restore
the flow of ch’i.
The interplay of yin and yang, the primordial pair of opposites,
appears thus as the principle that guides all the movements
of the Tao, but the Chinese did not stop there. They went on
to study various combinations of yin and yang which they
developed into a system of cosmic archetypes. This system is
elaborated in the I Ching, or Book of Changes.
The Book of Changes is the first among the six Confucian
Classics and must be considered as a work which lies at the very
heart of Chinese thought and culture. The authority and esteem
it has enjoyed in China throughout thousands of years is
comparable only to those of sacred scriptures, like the Vedas
or the Bible, in other cultures. The noted sinologue Richard
Wilhelm begins the introduction to his translation of the book
with the following words:
The Book of Changes-/ Ching in Chinese-is unquestion-
ably one of the most important books in the world’s
literature. Its origin go&back to mythical antiquity, and
it has occupied the attention of the most eminent scholars
of China down to the- present day. Nearly all that is
