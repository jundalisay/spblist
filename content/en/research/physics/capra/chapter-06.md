Buddhism has been, for many centuries, the dominant spiritual tradition in most parts of Asia, including the countries of
Indochina, as well as Sri Lanka, Nepal, Tibet, China, Korea and Japan. As with Hinduism in India, it has had a strong influence
on the intellectual, cultural and artistic life of these countries.

Unlike Hinduism, however, Buddhism goes back to a single founder, Siddhartha Gautama, the so-called ‘historic’ Buddha.
He lived in India in the middle of the sixth century BC, during the extraordinary period that saw the birth of so many spiritual and philosophical geniuses: Confucius and Lao Tzu in China, Zarathustra in Persia, Pythagoras and Heraclitus in Greece. 

If the flavour of Hinduism is mythological and ritualistic, that of Buddhism is definitely psychological. The Buddha was not
interested in satisfying human curiosity about the origin of the world, the nature of the Divine, or similar questions. He
was concerned exclusively with the human situation, with the suffering and frustrations of human beings. His doctrine,
therefore, was not one of metaphysics, but one of psychotherapy.

He pointed out the origin of human frustrations and the way to overcome them, taking up for this purpose the
traditional Indian concepts of maya, karma, nirvana, etc., and
giving them a fresh, dynamic and directly relevant psychological
interpretation.

After the Buddha’s death, Buddhism developed into 2 main schools, the Hinayana and the Mahayana. The Hinayana,
or Small Vehicle, is an orthodox school which sticks to the letter
of the Buddha’s teaching, whereas the Mahayana, or Great
Vehicle, shows a more flexible attitude, believing that the spirit
of the doctrine is more important than its original formulation.

The Hinayana school established itself in Ceylon, Burma and Thailand, whereas the Mahayana spread to Nepal, Tibet, China,
and Japan and became, eventually, the more important of the two schools. In India itself, Buddhism was absorbed, after many
centuries, by the flexible and assimilative Hinduism, and the Buddha was finally adopted as an incarnation of the many-
faced god Vishnu.

As Mahayana Buddhism spread across Asia, it came into
contact with peoples of many different cultures and mentalities
who interpreted the Buddha’s doctrine from their own point
of view, elaborating many of its subtle points in great detail
and adding their own original ideas. In this way they kept
Buddhism alive over the centuries and developed highly
sophisticated philosophies with profound psychological in-
sights.
In spite of the high intellectual level of these philosophies,
however, Mahayana Buddhism never loses itself in abstract
speculative thought. As always in Eastern mysticism, the
intellect is seen merely as a means to clear the way for the
direct mystical experience, which Buddhists call the/awakening’.
The essence of this experience is to pass beyond the world of
intellectual distinctions and opposites to reach the world of
acintya, the unthinkable, where reality appears as undivided
and undifferentiated ‘suchness’.
This was the experience Siddhartha Cautama had one night,
after seven years of strenuous discipline in the forests. Sitting
in deep meditation under the celebrated Bodhi Tree, the Tree
of Enlightenment, he suddenly obtained the final and definite
clarification of all his searches and doubts in the act of ‘un-
excelled, complete awakening’ which made him the Buddha,
that is, ‘the Awakened’. For the Eastern world, the Buddha’s
image in the state of meditation is as significant as the image
of the crucified Christ for the West, and has inspired countless
artists all over Asia who have created magnificent sculptures
of meditating Buddhas.
According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha went to the Deer
Park of Benares immediately after his awakening to preach his
doctrine to his former fellow hermits. He expressed it in the
celebrated form of the Four Noble Truths, a compact presenta-

tion of the essential doctrine which is not unlike the statement
of a physician, who first identifies the cause of humanity’s
sickness, then affirms that the sickness can be cured, and
finally prescribes the remedy.
The First Noble Truth states the outstanding characteristic
of the human situation, duhkha, which is suffering or frustration.
This frustration comes from our difficulty in facing the basic
fact of life, that everything around us is impermanent and
transitory. ‘All things arise and pass away,” said the Buddha,
and the notion that flow and change are basic features of
nature lies at the root of Buddhism. Suffering arises, in the
Buddhist view, whenever we resist the flow of life and try to
cling to fixed forms which are all maya, whether they are
things, events, people or ideas. This doctrine of impermanence
includes also the notion that there is no ego, no self which is
the persistent subject of our varying experiences. Buddhism
holds that the idea of a separate individual self is an illusion,
just another form of maya, an intellectual concept which has
no reality. To cling to this concept leads to the same frustration
as adherence to any other fixed category of thought.
The Second Noble Truth deals with the cause of all suffering,
trishna, which is clinging, or grasping. It is the futile grasping
of life based on a wrong point of view which is called aviciya,
or ignorance, in Buddhist philosophy. Out of this ignorance,
we divide the perceived world into individual and separate
things and thus attempt to confine the fluid forms of reality in
fixed categories created by the mind. As long as this view
prevails, we are bound to experience frustration after frustra-
tion. Trying to cling to things which we see as firm and per-
sistent, but which in fact are transient and ever-changing, we
are trapped in a vicious circle where every action generates
further action and the answer to each question poses new
questions. This vicious circle is known in Buddhism as samsara,
the round of birth-and-death, and it is driven by karma, the
never-ending chain of cause and effect.
The Third Noble Truth states that the suffering and frustration
can be ended. It is possible to transcend the vicious circle of
samsara, to free oneself from the bondage of karma, and to
reach a state of total liberation called nirvana. In this state, the
false notions of a separate self have for ever disappeared and


the oneness of all life has become a constant sensation.
Nirvana is the equivalent of moksha in Hindu philosophy and,
being a state of consciousness beyond all intellectual concepts,
it defies further description. To reach nirvana is to attain
awakening, or Buddhahood.
The Fourth Noble Truth is the Buddha’s prescription to end
all suffering, the Eightfold Path of self-development which leads
to the state of Buddhahood. The first two sections of this path,
as already mentioned, are concerned with right seeing and
right knowing, that is with the clear insight into the human
situation that is the necessary starting point. The next four
sectionsdealwithrightaction.TheygivetherulesfortheBuddhist
way of life, which is a Middle Way between opposite extremes.
The last two sections are concerned with right awareness and
right meditation and describe the direct mystical experience of
reality that is the final goal.
The Buddha did not develop his doctrine into a consistent
philosophical system, but regarded it as a means to achieve
enlightenment. His statements about the world were confined
to emphasizing the impermanence of all ‘things’. He insisted
on freedom from spiritual authority, including his own, saying
that he could only show the way to Buddhahood, and that it
was up to every individual to tread this way to the end through
his or her own efforts. The Buddha’s last words on his deathbed
are characteristic of his world view and of his attitude as a
teacher. ‘Decay is inherent in all compounded things,’ he said
before passing away; ‘Strive on with diligence.‘*
In the first few centuries after the Buddha’s death, several
Great Councils were held by the leading monks of the Buddhist
order at which the entire teaching was recited aloud and
differences in interpretation were settled. At the fourth of
these councils, which took place on the island of Ceylon (Sri
Lanka) in the first century A.D., the memorized doctrine, which
had been passed on orally for more than five hundred years, was
for the first time recorded in writing. This record, written in the
Pali language, is known as the Pali Canon and forms the basis of
the orthodox Hinayana school. The Mahayana school, on the
other hand, is based on a number of so-called s&as, scriptures
of huge dimensions, which were written in Sanskrit one or two


hundred years later and present the Buddha’s teaching in a
much more elaborate and subtle way than the Pali Canon.
The Mahayana school calls itself the Great Vehicle of
Buddhism because it offers its adherents a great variety of
methods, or ‘skilful means’ to attain Buddhahood. These range
from doctrines emphasizing religious faith in the teachings of
the Buddha, to elaborate philosophies involving concepts
which come very close to modern scientific thought.
The first expounder of the Mahayana doctrine, and one of
the deepest thinkers among the Buddhist patriarchs, was
Ashvaghosha, who lived in” the first century A.D. He spelled
out the fundamental thoughts of Mahayana Buddhism-in
particular those relating to the Buddhist concept of ‘suchness’-
in a small book called The Awakening of Faith. This lucid and
extremely beautiful text, which reminds one of the Bhagavad
Gita in many ways, constitutes the first representative treatise
on the Mahayana doctrine and has become a principal
authority for all schools of Mahayana Buddhism.
Ashvaghosha probably had a strong influence on Nagarjuna,
the most intellectual Mahayana philosopher, who used a highly
sophisticated dialectic to show the limitations of all concepts
of reality. With brilliant arguments he demolished the meta-
physical propositions of his time and thus demonstrated that
reality, ultimately, cannot be grasped with concepts and ideas.
Hence, he gave it the name sunyata, ‘the void’, or ‘emptiness’,
a term which is equivalent to Ashvaghosha’s tathata, or ‘such-
ness’; when the futility of all conceptual thinking is recognized,
reality is experienced as pure suchness.
Nagarjuna’s statement that the essential nature of reality
is emptiness is thus far from being the nihilist statement for
which it is often taken. It merely means that all concepts about
reality formed by the human mind are ultimately void. Reality,
or Emptiness, itself is not a state of mere nothingness, but is
the very source of all life and the essence of all forms.
The views of Mahayana Buddhism presented so far reflect
its intellectual, speculative side. This, however, is only one
side of Buddhism. Complementary to it is the Buddhist’s
religious consciousness which involves faith, love and com-
passion. True enlightened wisdom (bodhi) is seen in the
Mahayana as being composed of two elements which D. T.


Suzuki has called the ‘two pillars supporting the great edifice
of Buddhism’. They are prajna, which is transcendental wisdom,
or intuitive intelligence, and Karuna, which is love or corn-
passion.
Accordingly, the essential nature of all things is described
in Mahayana Buddhism not only by the abstract metaphysical
terms Suchness and Void, but also by the term Dharmakaya,
the ‘Body of Being’, which describes reality as it appears to the
Buddhist’s religious consciousness. The Dharmakaya is similar
to the Brahman in Hinduism. It pervades all material things in
the universe and is also reflected in the human mind as bodhi,
the enlightened wisdom. It is thus spiritual and material at the
same time.
The emphasis on love and compassion as essential parts of
wisdom has found its strongest expression in the ideal of the
Bodhisattva, one of the characteristic developments of
Mahayana Buddhism. A Bodhisattva is a highly evolved human
being on the way to becoming a Buddha, who is not seeking en-
lightenment for himself alone, but has vowed to help all other
beings achieve Buddhahood before he enters into nirvana. The
origin of this idea lies in the decision of the Buddha-presented
in Buddhist tradition as a conscious and not at all easy decision-
not simply to enter nirvana, but to return to the world in order
to show the path to salvation to his fellow human beings. The
Bodhisattva ideal is also consistent with the Buddhist doctrine
of non-ego, because if there is no separate individual self, the
idea of one individual entering nirvana alone obviously does
not make much sense.
The element of faith, finally, is emphasized in the so-called
Pure Land school of Mahayana Buddhism. The basis of this
school is the Buddhist doctrine that the original nature of all
human beings is that of a Buddha, and it holds that in order
to enter nirvana, or the ‘Pure Land’, all one has to do is to
have faith in one’s original Buddha nature.
The culmination of Buddhist thought has been reached, accord-
ing to many authors, in the so-called Avatamsaka school which
is based on the sutra of the same name. This sutra is regarded
as the core of Mahayana Buddhism and is praised by Suzuki
in the most enthusiastic words:

As to the Avatamsaka-sutra,
it is really the consummation
of Buddhist thought, Buddhist sentiment, and Buddhist
experience. To my mind, no religious literature in the
world can ever approach the grandeur of conception, the
depth of feeling, and the gigantic scale of composition as
attained in this sutra. It is the eternal fountain of life from
which no religious mind will turn back athirst or only
partially satisfied.3
It was this sutra which stimulated Chinese and Japanese
minds more than anything else, when Mahayana Buddhism
spread across Asia. The contrast between the Chinese and
Japanese, on the one hand, and the Indians, on the other, is
so great that they have been said to represent two poles of
the human mind. Whereas the former are practical, pragmatic
and socially minded, the latter are imaginative, metaphysical
and transcendental. When the Chinese and Japanese philo-
sophers began to translate and interpret the Avatamsaka, one
of the greatest scriptures produced by the Indian religious
genius, the two poles combined to form a new dynamic unity
and the outcome were the ha-yen philosophy in China and
the Kegon philosophy in Japan which constitute, according
to Suzuki, ‘the climax of Buddhist thought which has been
developing in the Far East for the last two thousand years’.4
The central theme of the Avatamsaka is the unity and inter-
relation of all things and events; a conception which is not only
the very essence of the Eastern world view, but also one of the
basic elements of the world view emerging from modern
physics. It will therefore be seen that the Avatamsaka Sutra,
this ancient religious text, offers the most striking parallels to
the models and theories of modern physics.
