However, 

<!-- These laws were seen as the basic laws of nature and Newton’s mechanics was
considered to be the ultimate theory of natural phenomena.

And yet, it was less than a hundred years later that a new
physical reality was discovered which made the limitations of
the Newtonian model apparent and showed that none of its
features had absolute validity.

This realization did not come abruptly, but was initiated by
developments that had already started in the nineteenth
century and prepared the way for the scientific revolutions of
our time.  -->

The first of these developments was the discovery
and investigation of electric and magnetic phenomena which
could not be described appropriately by the mechanistic
model and involved a new type of force. 

The important step
was made by Michael Faraday and Clerk Maxwell-the first,
one of the greatest experimenters in the history of science,
the second, a brilliant theorist. When Faraday produced an
electric current in a coil of copper by moving a magnet near
it, and thus converted the mechanical work of moving the
magnet into electric energy, he brought science and tech-
nology to a turning point. 

His fundamental experiment gave
birth, on the one hand, to the vast technology of electrical
engineering; on the other hand, it formed the basis of his and
Maxwell’s theoretical speculations which, eventually, resulted
in a complete theory of electromagnetism. Faraday and
Maxwell did not only study the effects of the electric and magnetic forces, but made the forces themselves the primary
object of their investigation. They replaced the concept of a force by that of a force field, and in doing so they were the
first to go beyond Newtonian physics.

Instead of interpreting the interaction between a positive and a negative charge simply by saying that the two charges
attract each other like two masses in Newtonian mechanics, Faraday and Maxwell found it more appropriate to say that
each charge creates a ‘disturbance’, or a ‘condition’, in the
space around it so that the other charge, when it is present,
feels a force. This condition in space which has the potential
of producing a force is called a field. It is created by a single
charge and it exists whether or not another charge is brought
in to feel its effect.

This was a most profound change in man’s conception of physical reality. 

In the Newtonian view, the forces were rigidly connected with the bodies they act upon. 

Now the force concept was replaced by the much subtler concept of a field which had its own reality and could be studied without any reference to material bodies. The culmination of this theory,
called electrodynamics, was the realization that light is nothing but a rapidly alternating electromagnetic field travelling through space in the form of waves. 

Today we know that radio waves, light waves or X-rays, are all electromagnetic waves, oscillating
electric and magnetic fields differing only in the frequency of
their oscillation, and that visible light is only a tiny fraction of
the electromagnetic spectrum.

In spite of these far-reaching changes, Newtonian mechanics at first held its position as the basis of all physics. Maxwell
himself tried to explain his results in mechanical terms, interpreting the fields as states of mechanical stress in a very light space-filling medium, called ether, and the electromagnetic waves as elastic waves of this ether. This was only natural as waves are usually experienced as vibrations of something;
water waves as vibrations of water, sound waves as vibrations
of air. 

Maxwell, however, used several mechanical interpretations of his theory at the same time and apparently took none
of them really seriously. He must have realized intuitively, even
if he did not say so explicitly, that the fundamental entities in
his theory were the fields and not the mechanical models. It
was Einstein who clearly recognized this fact fifty years later
when he declared that no ether existed and that the electro-
magnetic fields were physical entities in their own right which
could travel through empty space and could not be explained
mechanically.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, then, physicists
had two successful theories which applied to different pheno-
mena : Newton’s mechanics and Maxwell’s electrodynamics.
Thus the Newtonian model had ceased to be the basis of all
physics.


MODERN PHYSICS

The first three decades of our century changed the whole
situation in physics radically. Two separate developments-
that of relativity theory and of atomic physics-shattered all
the principal concepts of the Newtonian world view: the notion
of absolute space and time, the elementary solid particles, the

strictly causal nature of physical phenomena, and the ideal of
an objective description of nature. None of these concepts
could be extended to the new domains into which physics was
now penetrating.
At the beginning of modern physics stands the extraordinary
intellectual feat of one man: Albert Einstein. In two articles,
both published in 1905, Einstein initiated two revolutionary
trends of thought. One was his special theory of relativity,
the other was a new way of looking at electromagnetic radiation
which was to become characteristic of quantum theory, the
theory of atomic phenomena. The complete quantum theory
was worked out twenty years later by a whole team of physicists.
Relativity theory, however, was constructed in its complete
form almost entirely by Einstein himself. Einstein’s scientific
papers stand at the beginning of the twentieth century as
imposing intellectual monuments-the pyramids of modern
civilization.
Einstein strongly believed in nature’s inherent harmony and
his deepest concern throughout his scientific life was to find a
unified foundation of physics. He began to move towards this
goal by constructing a common framework for electrodynamics
and mechanics, the two separate theories of classical physics.
This framework is known as the special theory of relativity. It
unified and completed the structure of classical physics, but
at the same time it involved drastic changes in the traditional
concepts of space and time and undermined one of the
foundations of the Newtonian world view.
According to relativity theory, space is not three-dimensional
and time is not a separate entity. Both are intimately connected
and form a four-dimensional continuum, ‘space-time’. In
relativity theory, therefore, we can never talk about space
without talking about time and vice versa. Furthermore, there
is no universal flow of time as in the Newtonian model. Different
observers will order events differently in time if they move
with different velocities relative to the observed events. In such
a case, two events which are seen as occurring simultaneously
by one observer may occur in different temporal sequences
for other observers. All measurements involving space and
time thus lose their absolute significance. In relativity theory,
the Newtonian concept of an absolute space as the stage of


physical phenomena is abandoned and so is the concept of
an absolute time. Both space and time become merely elements
of the language a particular observer uses for his description of
the phenomena.
The concepts of space and time are so basic for the des-
cription of natural phenomena that their modification entails
a modification of the whole framework that we use to describe
nature. The most important consequence of this modification
is the realization that mass is nothing but a form of energy.
Even an object at rest has energy stored in its mass, and the
relation between the two is given by the famous equation
E= mc2, c being the speed of light.
This constant c, the speed of light, is of fundamental im-
portance for the theory of relativity. Whenever we describe
physical phenomena involving velocities which approach the
speed of light, our description has to take relativity theory into
account. This applies in particular to electromagnetic pheno-
mena, of which light is just one example and which led Einstein
to the formulation of his theory.
In 1915, Einstein proposed his general theory of relativity in
which the framework of the special theory is extended to include
gravity, i.e. the mutual attraction of all massive bodies. Whereas
the special theory has been confirmed by innumerable experi-
ments, the general theory has not yet been confirmed con-
clusively. However, it is so far the most accepted, consistent
and elegant theory of gravity and is widely used in astrophysics
and cosmology for the description of the universe at large.
The force of gravity, according to Einstein’s theory, has the
effect of ‘curving’ space and time. This means that ordinary
Euclidean geometry is no longer valid in such a curved space,
just as the two-dimensional geometry of a plane cannot be
applied on the surface of a sphere. On a plane, we can draw,
for example, a square by marking off one metre on a straight line,
making a right angle and marking off another metre, then
making another right angle and marking off another metre,
and finally making a third right angle and marking off one metre
again, after which we are back at the starting point and the
square is completed. On a sphere, however, this procedure
does not work because the rules of Euclidean geometry do not
hold on curved surfaces. In the same way, we can define a 

three-dimensional curved space to be one in which Euclidean
geometry is no longer valid. Einstein’s theory, now, says that
three-dimensional space is actually curved, and that the curva-
ture is caused by the gravitational field of massive bodies 

Wherever there is a massive object, e.g. a star or a planet, the
space around it is curved and the degree of curvature depends
on the mass of the object. And as space can never be separated
from time in relativity theory, time as well is affected by the
presence of matter, flowing at different rates in different parts
of the universe. Einstein’s general theory of relativity thus
completely abolishes the concepts of absolute space and
time. Not only are all measurements involving space and time
relative; the whole structure of space-time depends on the
distribution of matter in the universe, and the concept of
‘empty space’ loses its meaning.
The mechanistic world view of classical physics was based on
the notion of solid bodies moving in empty space. This notion
is still valid in the region that has been called the ‘zone of
middle dimensions’, that is, in the realm of our daily experience
where classical physics continues to be a useful theory. Both
concepts-that of empty space and that of solid material
bodies-are deeply ingrained in our habits of thought, so it is
extremely difficult for us to imagine a physical reality where
they do not apply. And yet, this is precisely what modern
physics forces us to do when we go beyond the middle dimen-
sions. ‘Empty space’ has lost its meaning in astrophysics and
cosmology, the sciences of the universe at large, and the 

concept of solid objects was shattered by atomic physics, the
science of the infinitely small.
At the turn of the century, several phenomena connected
with the structure of atoms and inexplicable in terms of classical
physics were discovered. The first indication that atoms had
some structure came from the discovery of X-rays; a new
radiation which rapidly found its now well known application
in medicine. X-rays, however, are not the only radiation emitted
by atoms. Soon after their discovery, other kinds of radiation
were discovered which are emitted by the atoms of so-called
radioactive substances. The phenomenon of radioactivity gave
definite proof of the composite nature of atoms, showing that
the atoms of radioactive substances not only emit various
types of radiation, but also transform themselves into atoms of
completely different substances.
Besides being objects of intense study, these phenomena
were also used, in most ingenious ways, as new tools to probe
deeper into matter than had ever been possible before. Thus
Max von Laue used X-rays to study the arrangements of atoms
in crystals, and Ernest Rutherford realized that the so-called
alpha particles emanating from radioactive substances were
high-speed projectiles of subatomic size which could be used
to explore the interior of the atom. They could be fired at
atoms, and from the way they were deflected one could draw
conclusions about the atoms’ structure.
When Rutherford bombarded atoms with these alpha
particles, he obtained sensational and totally unexpected
results. Far from being the hard and solid particles they were
believed to be since antiquity, the atoms turned out to consist
of vast regions of space in which extremely small particles-the
electrons-moved around the nucleus, bound to it by electric
forces. It is not easy to get a feeling for the order of magnitude
of atoms, so far is it removed from our macroscopic scale. The
diameter of an atom is about one hundred millionth of a centi-
metre. In order to visualize this diminutive size, imagine an
orange blown up to the size of the Earth. The atoms of the
orange will then have the size of cherries. Myriads of cherries,
tightly packed into a globe of the size of the Earth-that’s a
magnified picture of the atoms in an orange.
An atom, therefore, is extremely small compared to macro-

scopic objects, but it is huge compared to the nucleus in its
centre. In our picture of cherry-sized atoms, the nucleus of an
atom will be so small that we will not be able to see it. If we
blew up the atom to the size of a football, or even to room size,
the nucleus would still be too small to be seen by the naked
eye. To see the nucleus, we would have to blow up the atom
to the size of the biggest dome in the world, the dome of St
Peter’s Cathedral in Rome. In an atom of that size, the nucleus
would have the size of a grain of salt! A grain of salt in the
middle of the dome of St Peter’s, and specks of dust whirling
around it in the vast space of the dome-this is how we can
picture the nucleus and electrons of an atom.
Soon after the emergence of this ‘planetary’ model of the
atom, it was discovered that the number of electrons in the
atoms of an element determine the element’s chemical pro-
perties, and today we know that the whole periodic table of
elements can be built up by successively adding protons and
neutrons to the nucleus of the lightest atom-hydrogen*-and
the corresponding number of electrons to its atomic ‘shell’.
The interactions between the atoms give rise to the various
chemical processes, so that all of chemistry can now in principle
be understood on the basis of the laws of atomic physics.
These laws, however, were not easy to recognize. They were
discovered in the 1920s by an international group of physicists
including Niels Bohr from Denmark, Louis De Broglie from
France, Erwin Schrddinger and Wolfgang Pauli from Austria,
Werner Heisenberg from Germany, and Paul Dirac from
England. These men joined their forces across all national
borders and shaped one of the most exciting periods in modern
science, which brought man, for the first time, into contact
with the strange and unexpected reality of the subatomic
world. Every time the physicists asked nature a question in an
atomic experiment, nature answered with a paradox, and the
more they tried to clarify the situation, the sharper the paradoxes
became. It took them a long time to accept the fact that these
paradoxes belong to the intrinsic structure of atomic physics,
and to realize that they arise whenever one attempts to
describe atomic events in the traditional terms of physics.

Once this was perceived, the physicists began to learn to ask
the right questions and to avoid contradictions. In the words
of Heisenberg, ‘they somehow got into the spirit of the quantum
theory’, and finally they found the precise and consistent
mathematical formulation of this theory.
The concepts of quantum theory were not easy to accept
even after their mathematical formulation had been completed.
Their effect on the physicists’ imaginations was truly shattering.
Rutherford’s experiments had shown that atoms, instead of
being hard and indestructible, consisted of vast regions of
space in which extremely small particles moved, and now
quantum theory made it clear that even these particles were
nothing like the solid objects of classical physics. The subatomic
units of matter are very abstract entities which have a dual
aspect. Depending on how we look at them, they appear
sometimes as particles, sometimes as waves; and this dual
nature is also exhibited by light which can take the form of
electromagnetic waves or of particles.
This property of matter and of light is very strange. It seems
impossible to accept that something can be, at the same time,
a particle-i.e. an entity confined to a very small volume-and

a wave, which is spread out over a large region of space. This
contradiction gave rise to most of the koan-like paradoxes
which finally led to the formulation of quantum theory. The
whole development started when Max Planck discovered that
the energy of heat radiation is not emitted continuously, but
appears in the form of ‘energy packets’. Einstein called these
energy packets ‘quanta’ and recognized them as a fundamental
aspect of nature. He was bold enough to postulate that light
and every other form of electromagnetic radiation can appear
not only as electromagnetic waves, but also in the form of
these quanta. The light quanta, which gave quantum theory
its name, have since been accepted as bona fide particles and
are now called photons. They are particles of a special kind,
however, massless and always travelling with the speed of
light.

The apparent contradiction between the particle and the
wave picture was solved in a completely unexpected way
which called in question the very foundation of the mechanistic
world view-the concept of the reality of matter. At the sub-
atomic level, matter does not exist with certainty at definite
places, but rather shows ‘tendencies to exist’, and atomic events
do not occur with certainty at definite times and in definite
ways, but rather show ‘tendencies to occur’. In the formalism
of quantum theory, these tendencies are expressed as prob-
abilities and are associated with mathematical quantities
which take the form of waves. This is why particles can be
waves at the same time. They are not ‘real’ three-dimensional
waves like sound or water waves. They are ‘probability waves’,
abstract mathematical quantities with all the characteristic
properties of waves which are related to the probabilities of
finding the particles at particular points in space and at parti-
cular times. All the laws of atomic physics are expressed in
terms of these probabilities. We can never predict an atomic
event with certainty; we can only say how likely it is to happen.
Quantum theory has thus demolished the classical concepts
of solid objects and of strictly deterministic laws of nature. At
the subatomic level, the solid material objects of classical
physics dissolve into wave-like patterns of probabilities, and
these patterns, ultimately, do not represent probabilities of
things, but rather probabilities of interconnections. A careful
analysis of the process of observation in atomic physics has
shown that the subatomic particles have no meaning as
isolated entities, but can only be understood as interconnections
between the preparation of an experiment and the subsequent
measurement. Quantum theory thus reveals a basic oneness
of the universe. It shows that we cannot decompose the world
into independently existing smallest units. As we penetrate
into matter, nature does not show us any isolated ‘basic
building blocks’, but rather appears as a complicated web of
relations between the various parts of the whole. These re-
lations always include the observer in an essential way. The
human observer constitutes the final link in the chain of ob-
servational processes, and the properties of any atomic object
can only be understood in terms of the object’s interaction
with the observer. This means that the classical ideal of an
 
objective description of nature is no longer valid. The Cartesian
partition between the I and the world, between the observer
and the observed, cannot be made when dealing with atomic
matter. In atomic physics, we can never speak about nature
without, at the same time, speaking about ourselves.
The new atomic theory could immediately solve several
puzzles which had arisen in connection with the structure of
atoms and could not be explained by Rutherford’s planetary
model. First of all, Rutherford’s experiments had shown that
the atoms making up solid matter consist almost entirely of
empty space, as far as the distribution of mass is concerned.
But if all the objects around us, and we ourselves, consist
mostly of empty space, why can’t we walk through closed
doors? In other words, what is it that gives matter its solid
aspect?
A second puzzle was the extraordinary mechanical stability
of atoms. In the air, for example, atoms collide millions of times
every second and yet go back to their original form after each
collision. No planetary system following the laws of classical
mechanics would ever come out of these collisions unaltered.
But an oxygen atom will always retain its characteristic con-
figuration of electrons, no matter how often it collides with
other atoms. This configuration, furthermore, is exactly the
same in all atoms of a given kind. Two iron atoms, and con-
sequently two pieces of pure iron, are completely identical,
no matter where they come from or how they have been
treated in the past.
Quantum theory has shown that all these astonishing pro-
perties of atoms arise from the wave nature of their electrons.
To begin with, the solid aspect of matter is the consequence of
a typical ‘quantum effect’ connected with the dual wave/particle
aspect of matter, a feature of the subatomic world which has
no macroscopic analogue. Whenever a particle is confined to
a small region of space it reacts to this confinement by moving
around, and the smaller the region of confinement is, the faster
the particle moves around in it. In the atom, now, there are
two competing forces. On the one hand, the electrons are
bound to the nucleus by electric forces which try to keep them
as close as possible. On the other hand, they respond to their
confinement by whirling around, and the tighter they are

bound to the nucleus, the higher their velocity will be; in fact,
the confinement of electrons in an atom results in enormous
velocities of about 600 miles per second! These high velocities
make the atom appear as a rigid sphere, just as a fast rotating
propeller appears as a disc. It is very difficult to compress atoms
any further and thus they give matter its familiar solid aspect.
In the atom, then, the electrons settle in orbits in such a
way that there is an optimal balance between the attraction
of the nucleus and their reluctance to be confined. The atomic
orbits, however, are very different from those of the planets in
the solar system, the difference arising from the wave nature
of the electrons. An atom cannot be pictured as a small
planetary system. Rather than particles circling around the
nucleus, we have to imagine probability waves arranged in
different orbits. Whenever we make a measurement, we will
find the electrons somewhere in these orbits, but we cannot
say that they are ‘going around the nucleus’ in the sense of
classical mechanics.
In the orbits, the electron waves have to be arranged in
such a way that ‘their ends meet’, i.e. that they form patterns
known as ‘standing waves’. These patterns appear whenever
waves are confined to a finite region, like the waves in a vibrating
guitar string, or in the air inside a flute (see diagram overleaf). It is
well known from these examples that standing waves can
assume only a limited number of well-defined shapes. In the case
of the electron waves inside an atom, this means that they can
exist only in certain atomic orbits with definite diameters. The
electron of a hydrogen atom, for example, can only exist in a
certain first, second or third orbit, etc., and nowhere in between.
Under normal conditions, it will always be in its lowest orbit,
called the ‘ground state’ of the atom. From there, the electron
can jump to higher orbits if it receives the necessary amount of
energy, and then the atom is said to be in an ‘excited state’
from which it will go back to its ground state after a while,
the electron giving off the surplus energy in the form of a
quantum of electromagnetic radiation, or photon. The states
of an atom, i.e. the shapes and mutual distances of its electron
orbits, are exactly the same for all atoms with the same number
of electrons. This is why any two oxygen atoms, for example,

will be completely identical. They may be in different excited
states, perhaps due to collisions with other atoms in the air,
but after a while they will invariably return to exactly the same
ground state. The wave nature of the electrons accounts thus
for the identity of atoms and for their great mechanical
stability.
A further characteristic feature of atomic states is the fact
that they can be completely specified by a set of integral
numbers, called ‘quantum numbers’, which indicate the loca-
tion and shape of the electron orbits. The first quantum number
is the number of the orbit and determines the energy an
electron must have to be in that orbit; two more numbers
specify the detailed shape of the electron wave in the orbit
and are related to the speed and orientation of the electron’s

rotation.* The fact that these details are expressed by integral
numbers means that the electron cannot change its rotation
continuously, but can only jump from one value to another,
just as it can only jump from one orbit to another. Again the
higher values represent excited states of the atom, the ground
state being the one where all the electrons are in the lowest
possible orbits and have the smallest possible amounts of
rotation.
Tendencies to exist, particles reacting to confinement with
motion, atoms switching suddenly from one ‘quantum state’
to another, and an essential interconnectedness of all pheno-
mena-these are some of the unusual features of the atomic
world. The basic force, on the other hand, which gives rise to
all atomic phenomena is familiar and can be experienced in
the macroscopic world. It is the force of electric attraction
between the positively charged atomic nucleus and the
negatively charged electrons. The interplay of this force with
the electron waves gives rise to the tremendous variety of
structures and phenomena in our environment. It is responsible
for all chemical reactions, and for the formation of molecules,
that is, of aggregates of several atoms bound to each other by
mutual attraction. The interaction between electrons and
atomic nuclei is thus the basis of all solids, liquids and gases,
and also of all living organisms and of the biological processes
associated with them.
In this immensely rich world of atomic phenomena, the
nuclei play the role of extremely small, stable centres which
constitute the source of the electric force and form the
skeletons of the great variety of molecular structures. To
understand these structures, and most of the natural.pheno-
mena around us, it is not necessary to know more about the
nuclei than their charge and their mass. In order to understand
the nature of matter, however, to know what matter is ultimately
made of, one has to study the atomic nuclei which contain
practically all of its mass. In the 193Os, after quantum theory
had unravelled the world of atoms, it was therefore the main


*The ‘rotation’ of an electron in its orbit must not be understood in the classical
sense; it is determined by the shape of the electron wave in terms of the
probabilities for the particle’s existence in certain parts of the orbit.



task of physicists to understand the structure of nuclei, their
constituents and the forces which hold them together so
tightly.
The first important step towards an understanding of nuclear
structure was the discovery of the neutron as the second
constituent of the nucleus, a particle which has roughly the
same mass as the proton (the first nuclear constituent)-about
two thousand times the mass of the electron-but does not
carry an electric charge. This discovery not only explained
how the nuclei of all chemical elements were built up from
protons and neutrons, but also revealed that the nuclear force,
which kept these particles so tightly bound within the nucleus,
was a completely new phenomenon. It could not be of electro-
magnetic origin since the neutrons were electrically neutral.
Physicists soon realized that they were here confronted with a
new force of nature which does not manifest itself anywhere
outside the nucleus.
An atomic nucleus is about one hundred thousand times
smaller than the whole atom and yet it contains almost all of
the atom’s mass. This means that matter inside the nucleus
must be extremely dense compared to the forms of matter
we are used to. Indeed, if the whole human body were com-
pressed to nuclear density it would not take up more space
than a pinhead. This high density, however, is not the only
unusual property of nuclear matter. Being of the same quantum
nature as electrons, the ‘nucleons’-as the protons and
neutrons are often called-respond to their confinement with
high velocities, and since they are squeezed into a much smaller
volume their reaction is all the m-ore violent. They race about
in the nucleus with velocities of about 40,000 miles per second!
Nuclear matter is thus a form of matter entirely’different from
anything we experience ‘up here’ in our macroscopic environ-
ment. We can, perhaps, picture it best as tiny drops of an
extremely dense liquid which is boiling and bubbling most
fiercely.
The essential new aspect of nuclear matter which accounts
for all its unusual properties is the strong nuclear force, and
the feature that makes this force so unique is its extremely
short range. It acts only when the nucleons come very near
to each other, that is, when their distance is about two to

three times their diameter. At such a distance, the nuclear
force is strongly attractive, but when the distance becomes
less the force becomes strongly repulsive so that the nucleons
cannot approach each other any closer. In this way, the nuclear
force keeps the nucleus in an extremely stable, though extremely
dynamic equilibrium.
The picture of matter which emerges from the study of
atoms and nuclei shows that most of it is concentrated in tiny
drops separated by huge distances. In the vast space between
the massive and fiercely boiling nuclear drops move the
electrons. These constitute only a tiny fraction of the total
mass, but give matter its solid aspect and provide the links
necessary to build up the molecular structures. They are also
involved in the chemical reactions and are responsible for the
chemical properties of matter. Nuclear reactions, on the other
hand, generally do not occur naturally in this form of matter
because the available energies are not high enough to disturb
the nuclear equilibrium.
This form of matter, however, with its multitude of shapes
and textures and its complicated molecular architecture, can
exist only under very special conditions, when the temperature
is not too high, so that the molecules do not jiggle too much.
When the thermal energy increases about a hundredfold, as
it does in most stars, all atomic and molecular structures are
destroyed. Most of the matter in the universe exists, in fact, in
a state which is very different from the one just described. In
the centre of the stars exist large accumulations of nuclear
matter, and nuclear processes which occur only very rarely on
earth predominate there. They are essential for the great variety
of stellar phenomena observed in astronomy, most of which
arise from a combination of nuclear and gravitational effects.
For our planet, the nuclear processes in the centre of the Sun
are of particular importance because they furnish the energy
which sustains our terrestrial environment. It has been one of
the great triumphs of modern physics to discover that the
constant energy flow from the Sun, our vital link with the
world of the very large, is a result of nuclear reactions, of
phenomena in the world of the infinitely small.
In the history of man’s penetration into this submicroscopic


world, a stage was reached in the early 1930s when scientists
thought they had now finally discovered the ‘basic building
blocks’ of matter. It was known that all matter consisted of
atoms and that all atoms consisted of protons, neutrons and
electrons. These so-called ‘elementary particles’ were seen as
the ultimate indestructible units of matter: atoms in the Demo-
critean sense. Although quantum theory implies, as mentioned
previously, that we cannot decompose the world into in-
dependently existing smallest units, this was not generally
perceived at that time. The classical habits of thought were
still so persistent that most physicists tried to understand matter
in terms of its ‘basic building blocks’, and this trend of thought
is, in fact, quite strong even today.
Two further developments in modern physics have shown,
however, that the notion of elementary particles as the primary
units of matter has to be abandoned. One of these develop-
ments was experimental, the other theoretical, and both began
in the 1930s. On the experimental side, new particles were
discovered as physicists refined their experimental techniques
and developed ingenious new devices for particle detection.
Thus the number of particles increased from three to six by
1935, then to eighteen by 1955, and today we know over two
hundred ‘elementary’ particles. The two tables overleaf,
taken from a recent publication,” show most of the particles
known today. They illustrate convincingly that the adjective
‘elementary’ is no longer very attractive in such a situation.
As more and more particles were discovered over the years,
it became clear that not all of them could be called ‘elementary’,
and today there is a widespread belief among physicists that
none of them deserves this name.
This belief is enforced by the theoretical developments
which paralleled the discovery of an ever-increasing number of
particles. Soon after the formulation of quantum theory, it
became clear that a complete theory of nuclear phenomena
must not only be a quantum theory, but must also incorporate
relativity theory. This is because the particles confined to
dimensions of the size of nuclei often move so fast that their
speed comes close to the speed of light. This fact is crucial for
the description of their behaviour, because every description
of natural phenomena involving velocities close to the speed

of light has to take relativity theory into account. It has to be,
as we say, a ‘relativist/c’ description. What we need, therefore,
for a full understanding of the nuclear world is a theory which
incorporates both quantum theory and relativity theory. Such
a theory has not yet been found, and therefore we have as
yet been unable to formulate a complete theory of the nucleus.
Although we know quite a lot about nuclear structure and
about the interactions between nuclear particles, we do not
yet understand the nature and complicated form of the
nuclear force on a fundamental level. There is no complete
theory of the nuclear particle world comparable to quantum
theory for the atomic world. We do have several ‘quantum-
relativistic’ models which describe some aspects of the world
of particles very well, but the fusion of quantum and relativity
theory into a complete theory of the particle world is still the

central problem and great challenge of modern fundamental
physics.
Relativity theory has had a profound influence on our picture
of matter by forcing us to modify our concept of a particle in
an essential way. In classical physics, the mass of an object
had always been associated with an indestructible material
substance, with some ‘stuff’ of which all things were thought
to be made. Relativity theory showed that mass has nothing
to do with any substance, but is a form of energy. Energy,
however, is a dynamic quantity associated with activity, or
with processes. The fact that the mass of a particle is equivalent
to a certain amount of energy means that the particle can
no longer be seen as a static object, but has to be conceived
as a dynamic pattern, a process involving the energy which
manifests itself as the particle’s mass.
This new view of particles was initiated by Dirac when he
formulated a relativistic equation describing the behaviour of
electrons. Dirac’s theory was not only extremely successful in
accounting for the fine details of atomic structure, but also
revealed a fundamental symmetry between matter and anti-
matter. It predicted the existence of an anti-electron with the
same mass as the electron but with an opposite charge. This
positively charged particle, now called the positron, was
indeed discovered two years after Dirac had predicted it. The
symmetry between matter and antimatter implies that for
every particle there exists an antiparticle with equal mass and
opposite charge. Pairs of particles and antiparticles can be
created if enough energy is available and can be made to
turn into pure energy in the reverse process of annihilation.
These processes of particle creation and annihilation had
been predicted from Dirac’s theory before they were actually
discovered in nature, and since then they have been observed
millions of times.
The creation of material particles from pure energy is
certainly the most spectacular effect of relativity theory, and it
can only be understood in terms of the view of particles out-
lined above. Before relativistic particle physics, the constituents
of matter had always been considered as being either elementary
units which were indestructible and unchangeable, or as composite objects which could be broken up into their constituent
parts; and the basic question was whether one could divide
rnatter again and again, or whether one would finally arrive at
some smallest indivisible units. After Dirac’s discovery, the
whole question of the division of matter appeared in a new
light. When two particles collide with high energies, they
generally break into pieces, but these pieces are not smaller
than the original particles. They are again particles of the same
kind and are created out of the energy of motion (‘kinetic
energy’) involved in the collision process. The whole problem
of dividing matter is thus resolved in an unexpected sense.
The only way to divide subatomic particles further is to bang
them together in collision processes involving high energies.
This way, we can divide matter again and again, but we never
obtain smaller pieces because we just create particles out of
the energy involved in the process. The subatomic particles are
thus destructible and indestructible at the same time.
This state of affairs is bound to remain paradoxical as long
as we adopt the static view of composite ‘objects’ consisting
of ‘basic building blocks’. Only when the dynamic, relativistic
view is adopted does the paradox disappear. The particles are
then seen as dynamic patterns, or processes, which involve a
certain amount of energy appearing to us as their mass. In a
collision process, the energy of the two colliding particles is
redistributed to form a new pattern, and if it has been increased
by a sufficient amount of kinetic energy, this new pattern
may involve additional particles.
High-energy collisions of subatomic particles are the
principal method used by physicists to study the properties
of these particles, and particle physics is therefore also called
‘high-energy physics’. The kinetic energies required for the
collision experiments are achieved by means of huge particle
accelerators: enormous circular machines with circumferences
of several miles in which protons are accelerated to velocities
near the speed of light and are then made to collide with other
protons or with neutrons. It is impressive that machines of

that size are needed to study the world of the infinitely small.
They are the supermicroscopes of our time.
Most of the particles created in these collisions live for only
an extremely short time-much less than a millionth of a
second-after which they disintegrate again into protons,
neutrons and electrons. In spite of their exceedingly short
lifetime, these particles can not only be detected and their
properties measured but are actually made to leave tracks
which can be photographed! These particle tracks are pro-
duced in so-called bubble chambers in a manner similar to
the way a jet plane makes a trail in the sky. The actual particles
are many orders of magnitude smaller than the bubbles making
up the tracks, but from the thickness and curvature of a track
physicists can identify the particle that caused it. The picture
overleaf shows such bubble chamber tracks. The points from
which several tracks emanate are points of particle collisions,
and the curves are caused by magnetic fields which the
experimenters use to identify the particles. The collisions of
particles are our main experimental method to study their
properties and interactions, and the beautiful lines, spirals and
curves traced by the particles in bubble chambers are thus of
paramount importance for modern physics.


The high-energy scattering experiments of the past decades
have shown us the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the
particle world in the most striking way. Matter has appeared
in these experiments as completely mutable. All particles can
be transmuted into other particles; they can be created from
energy and can vanish into energy. In this world, classical
concepts like ‘elementary particle’, ‘material substance’ or
‘isolated object’, have lost their meaning; the whole universe
appears as a dynamic web of inseparable energy patterns. So
far, we have not yet found a complete theory to describe this
world of subatomic particles, but we do have several theoretical
models which describe certain aspects of it very well. None of
these models is free from mathematical difficulties, and they
all contradict each other in certain ways, but all of them reflect
the basic unity and the intrinsically dynamic character of
matter. They show that the properties of a particle can only be
understood in terms of its activity-of its interaction with the
surrounding environment-and that the particle, therefore,
cannot be seen as an isolated entity, but has to be understood
as an integrated part of the whole.
Relativity theory has not only affected our conception of
particles in a drastic way, but also our picture of the forces
between these particles. In a relativistic description of particle
interactions, the forces between the particles-that is their
mutual attraction or repulsion-are pictured as the exchange
of other particles. This concept is very difficult to visualize. It is
a consequence of the four dimensional space-time character of
the subatomic world and neither our intuition nor our language
can deal with this image very well. Yet it is crucial for an under-
standing of subatomic phenomena. It links the forces between
constituents of matter to the properties of other constituents
of matter, and thus unifies the two concepts, force and matter,
which had seemed to be so fundamentally different ever since
the Greek atomists. Both force and matter are now seen to
have their common origin in the dynamic patterns which we
call particles.
The fact that particles interact through forces which manifest
themselves as the exchange of other particles is yet another
reason why the subatomic world cannot be decomposed into
constituent parts. From the macroscopic level down to the

nuclear level, the forces which hold things together are relatively
weak and it is a good approximation to say that things consist
of constituent parts. Thus a grain of salt can be said to consist
of salt molecules, the salt molecules of two kinds of atoms,
those atoms to consist of nuclei and electrons, and the nuclei
of protons and neutrons. At the particle level, however, it is
no longer possible to see things that way.
In recent years, there has been an increasing amount of
evidence that the protons and neutrons, too, are composite
objects; but the forces holding them together are so strong
or-what amounts to the same-the velocities acquired by the
components are so high, that the relativistic picture has to be
applied, where the forces are also particles. Thus the distinction
between the constituent particles and the particles making up
the binding forces becomes blurred and the approximation
of an object consisting of constituent parts breaks down.
The particle world cannot be decomposed into elementary
components.
In modern physics, the universe is thus experienced as a dynamic,
inseparable whole which always includes the observer in an
essential way. In this experience, ,the traditional concepts of
space and time, of isolated objects, and of cause and effect,
lose their meaning. Such an experience, however, is very
similar to that of the Eastern mystics. The similarity becomes
apparent in quantum and relativity theory, and becomes even
stronger in the ‘quantum-relativistic’ models of subatomic
physics where both these theories combine to produce the
most striking parallels to Eastern mysticism.
Before spelling out these parallels in detail, I shall give a
brief account of the schools of Eastern philosophy which are
relevant to the comparison for the reader who is not familiar
with them. They are the various schools in the religious philo-
sophies of Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism. In the following
five chapters, the historical background, characteristic features
and philosophical concepts of these spiritual traditions will be
described, the emphasis being on those aspects and concepts
which will be important for the subsequent comparison with
physics.
