Before studying the parallels between modern physics and Eastern mysticism, we have to deal with the question of how we can make any comparison at all between an exact science,
expressed in the highly sophisticated language of modern
mathematics, and spiritual disciplines which are mainly based
on meditation and insist on the fact that their insights cannot
be communicated verbally.

What we want to compare are the statements made by scientists and Eastern mystics about their knowledge of the world. To establish the proper framework for this comparison, we must firstly ask ourselves what kind of ‘knowledge’ we are talking about; does the Buddhist monk from Angkor Wat or
Kyoto mean the same thing by ‘knowledge’ as the physicist from Oxford or Berkeley? Secondly, what kind of statements are we going to compare? 

What are we going to select from the experimental data, equations and theories on the one side,
and from the religious scriptures, ancient myths, or philo-
sophical treatises on the other? 

This chapter is intended to clarify these two points: the nature of the knowledge involved
and the language in which this knowledge is expressed.

Throughout history, it has been recognized that the human mind is capable of two kinds of knowledge, or two modes of consciousness, which have often been termed the rational and the intuitive, and have traditionally been associated with science and religion, respectively. 

In the West, the intuitive, religious type of knowledge is often devalued in favour of
rational, scientific knowledge, whereas the traditional Eastern
attitude is in general just the opposite. The following statements
about knowledge by two great minds of the West and the East
typify the two positions. 

Socrates in Greece made the famous statement ‘I know that I know nothing’, and Lao Tzu in China
said, ‘Not knowing that one knows is best.’ In the East, the
values attributed to the two kinds of knowledge are often
already apparent from the names given to them. The Upanishads,
for example, speak about a higher and a lower knowledge and
associate the lower knowledge with various sciences, the higher
with religious awareness. Buddhists talk about ‘relative’ and
‘absolute’ knowledge, or about ‘conditional truth’ and ‘trans-
cendental truth’. Chinese philosophy, on the other hand, has
always emphasized the complementary nature of the intuitive
and the rational and has represented them by the archetypal
pair yin and yang which form the basis of Chinese thought.
Accordingly, two complementary philosophical traditions-
Taoism and Confucianism-have developed in ancient China
to deal with the two kinds of knowledge.

Rational knowledge is derived from the experience we have
with objects and events in our everyday environment. It
belongs to the realm of the intellect whose function it is to
discriminate, divide, compare, measure and categorize. In this
way, a world of intellectual distinctions is created; of opposites
which can only exist in relation to each other, which is why
Buddhists call this type of knowledge ‘relative’.

Abstraction is a crucial feature of this knowledge, because in
order to compare and to classify the immense variety of shapes,
structures and phenomena around us we cannot take all their
features into account, but have to select a few significant ones.


Thus we construct an intellectual map of reality in which things are reduced to their general outlines. Rational knowledge is thus a system of abstract concepts and symbols, characterized
by the linear, sequential structure which is typical of our
thinking and speaking. In most languages this linear structure
is made explicit by the use of alphabets which serve to communicate experience and thought in long lines of letters.


The natural world, on the other hand, is one of infinite
varieties and complexities, a multidimensional world which
contains no straight lines or completely regular shapes, where
things do not happen in sequences, but all together; a world
where-as modern physics tells us-even empty space is
curved. It is clear that our abstract system of conceptual
thinking can never describe or understand this reality com-
pletely. In thinking about the world we are faced with the same
kind of problem as the cartographer who tries to cover the
curved face of the Earth with a sequence of plane maps. We
can only expect an approximate representation of reality from
such a procedure, and all rational knowledge is therefore
necessarily limited.

The realm of rational knowledge is, of course, the realm of
science which measures and quantifies, classifies and analyses.
The limitations of any knowledge obtained by these methods
have become increasingly apparent in modern science, and in
particular in modern physics which has taught us, in the words
of Werner Heisenberg, ‘that every word or concept, clear as
it may seem to be, has only a limited range of applicability.”
For most of us it is very difficult to be constantly aware of the
limitations and of the relativity of conceptual knowledge.
Because our representation of reality is so much easier to grasp
than reality itself, we tend to confuse the two and to take our
concepts and symbols for reality. It is one of the main aims of
Eastern mysticism to rid us of this confusion. Zen Buddhists
say that a finger is needed to point at the moon, but that we
should not trouble ourselves with the finger once the moon
is recognized; the Taoist sage Chuang Tzu wrote:

Fishing baskets are employed to catch fish; but when the
fish are got, the men forget the baskets; snares are em-
ployed to catch hares; but when the hares are got, men
forget the snares. Words are employed to convey ideas;
but when the ideas are grasped, men forget the words.*
In the West, the semanticist Alfred Korzybski made exactly
the same point with his powerful slogan, ‘The map is not the
territory.’

What the Eastern mystics are concerned with is a direct
experience of reality which transcends not only intellectual

thinking but also sensory perception. In the words of the
Upanishads,
What is soundless, touchless, formless, imperishable,
Likewise tasteless, constant, odourless,
Without beginning, without end, higher than the great,
stable-
By discerning That, one is liberated from the mouth of
death.3
Knowledge which comes from such an experience is called
‘absolute knowledge’ by Buddhists because it does not rely
on the discriminations, abstractions and classifications of the
intellect which, as we have seen, are always relative and
approximate. It is, so we are told by Buddhists, the direct
experience of undifferentiated, undivided, indeterminate ‘such-
ness’. Complete apprehension of this suchness is not only the
core of Eastern mysticism, but is the central characteristic of
all mystical experience.
The Eastern mystics repeatedly insist on the fact that the
ultimate reality can never be an object of reasoning or of
demonstrable knowledge. It can never be adequately des-
cribed by words, because it lies beyond the realms of the senses
and of the intellect from which our words and concepts are
derived. The Upanishads say about it:
There the eye goes not,
Speech goes not, nor the mind.
We know not, we understand not
How one would teach it.4
Lao Tzu, who calls this reality the Tao, states the same fact in
the opening line of the Tao Te Ching: ‘The Tao that can be
expressed is not the eternal Tao.’ The fact-obvious from any
reading of the newspapers-that mankind has not become
much wiser over the past two thousand years, in spite of a
prodigious increase in rational knowledge, is ample evidence
of the impossibility of communicating absolute knowledge by
words. As Chuang Tzu said, ‘If it could be talked about, every-
body would have told their brother.‘5
Absolute knowledge is thus an entirely non-intellectual
