a new and completely unexpected development took place.
The study of the world of atoms forced physicists to realize
that our common language is not only inaccurate, but totally

Quantum theory and relativity theory, the two bases of
modern physics, have made it clear that this reality transcends
classical logic and that we cannot talk about it in ordinary
language. Thus Heisenberg writes :

with concepts of ordinary language; and the only thing
