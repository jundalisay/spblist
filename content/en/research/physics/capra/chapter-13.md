The central aim of Eastern mysticism is to experience all
phenomena in the world as manifestations of the same ultimate
reality. This reality is seen as the essence of the universe,
underlying and unifying the multitude of things and events
we observe. The Hindus call it &&man, the Buddhists Dharma-
kaya (the Body of Being), or Tathata (Suchness), and the Taoists
Tao; each affirming that it transcends our intellectual concepts
and defies further description. This ultimate essence, however,
cannot be separated from its multiple manifestations. It is
central to its very nature to manifest itself in myriad forms
which come into being and disintegrate, transforming them-
selves into one another without end. In its phenomenal aspect,
the cosmic One is thus intrinsically dynamic, and the appre-
hension of its dynamic nature is basic to all schools of Eastern
mysticism. Thus D. T. Suzuki writes about the Kegon school of
Mahayana Buddhism,
The central idea of Kegon is to grasp the universe dynamic-
ally whose characteristic is always to move onward, to be
forever in the mood of moving, which is life.’
This emphasis on movement, flow and change is not only
characteristic of the Eastern mystical traditions, but has been
an essential aspect of the world view of mystics throughout
the ages. In ancient Greece, Heraclitus taught that ‘everything
flows’ and compared the world to an ever-living fire, and in
Mexico, the Yaqui mystic Don Juan talks about the ‘fleeting
world’ and affirms that ‘to be a man of knowledge one needs
to be light and fluid.‘*


In Indian philosophy, the main terms used by Hindus and
Buddhists have dynamic connotations. The word Brahman is
derived from the Sanskrit root brih-to grow-and thus
suggests a reality which is dynamic and alive. In the words of
S. Radhakrishnan, The word Brahman means growth and is
suggestive of life, motion and progress.‘3 The &an&ha& refer
to Brahman as ‘this unformed, immortal, moving’,4 thus
associating it with motion even though it transcends all
forms.
The Rig Vecfa uses another term to express the dynamic
nature of the universe, the term Rita. This word comes from
the root ri-to move; its original meaning in the Rig Veda
being ‘the course of all things’, ‘the order of nature’. It plays
an important role in the legends of the Veda and is connected
with all the Vedic gods. The order of nature was conceived by
the Vedic seers, not as a static divine law, but as a dynamic
principle which is inherent in the universe. This idea is not
unlike the Chinese conception of Tao-The Way’-as the
way in which the universe works, i.e. the order of nature. Like
the Vedic seers, the Chinese sages saw the world in terms of
flow and change, and thus gave the idea of a cosmic order an
essentially dynamic connotation. Both concepts, Rita and Tao,
were later brought down from their original cosmic level to
the human level and were interpreted in a moral sense; Rita
as the universal law which all gods and men must obey, and
Tao as the right way of life.
The Vedic concept of Rita anticipates the idea of karma
which was developed later to express the dynamic interplay
of all things and events. The word karma means ‘action’ and
denotes the ‘active’, or dynamic, interrelation of all phenomena.
In the words of the Bhagavad Cita, ‘All actions take place in
time by the interweaving of the forces of nature.‘5 The Buddha
took up the traditional concept of karma and gave it a new
meaning by extending the idea of dynamic interconnections
to the sphere of human situations. Karma thus came to signify
the never-ending chain of cause and effect in human life which
the Buddha had broken in attaining the state of enlightenment.
Hinduism has also found many ways of’ expressing the
dynamic nature of the universe in mythical language. Thus
Krishna says in the Gita, ‘If I did not engage in action, these

worlds would perish,‘6 and Shiva, the Cosmic Dancer, is
perhaps the most perfect personification of the dynamic
universe. Through his dance, Shiva sustains the manifold
phenomena in the world, unifying all things by immersing
them in his rhythm and making them participate in the dance-
a magnificent image of the dynamic unity of the universe.
The general picture-emerging from Hinduism is one of an
organic, growing and rhythmically moving cosmos; of a
universe in which everything is fluid and ever-changing, all
static forms being maya, that is, existing only as illusory con-
cepts. This last idea-the impermanence of all forms-is the
starting point of Buddhism. The Buddha taught that ‘all com-
pounded things are impermanent’, and that all suffering in the
world arises from our trying to cling to fixed forms-objects,
people or ideas-instead of accepting the world as it moves
and changes. The dynamic world view lies thus at the very
root of Buddhism. In the words of S. Radhakrishnan:
191
The
Dynamic
Universe
A wonderful philosophy of dynamism was formulated by
Buddha 2,500 years ago . . . Impressed with the transitori-
ness of objects, the ceaseless mutation and transformation
of things, Buddha formulated a philosophy of change. He
reduces substances, souls, monads, things to forces,
movements, sequences and processes, and adopts a
dynamic conception of reality.’
Buddhists call this world of ceaseless change samsara,
which means, literally, ‘incessantly in motion’; and they affirm
that there is nothing in it which is worth clinging to. So for the
Buddhists, an enlightened being is one who does not resist
the flow of life, but keeps moving with it. When the Ch’an
monk’ Yin-men was asked, What is the Tao?’ he answered
simply, Walk on!’ Accordingly, Buddhists also call the Buddha
the Tathagata, or ‘the one who comes and goes thus’. In
Chinese philosophy, the flowing and ever-changing reality is
called the Tao and is seen as a cosmic process in which all
things are involved. Like the Buddhists, the Taoists say that one
should not resist the flow, but should adapt one’s actions to it.
This, again, is characteristic of the sage-the enlightened
being. If the Buddha is one who ‘comes and goes thus’, the


Taoist sage is one who ‘flows’, as Huai Nan Tzu says,* ‘in the
current of the Tao’.
The more one studies the religious and philosophical texts of
the Hindus, Buddhists and Taoists, the more it becomes
apparent that in all of them the world is conceived in terms of
movement, flow and change. This dynamic quality of Eastern
philosophy seems to be one of its most important features.
The Eastern mystics see the universe as an inseparable web,
whose interconnections are dynamic and not static. The cosmic
web is alive; it moves, grows and changes continually. Modern
physics, too, has come to conceive of the universe as such a
web of relations and, like Eastern mysticism; has recognized
that this web is intrinsically dynamic. The dynamic aspect of
matter arises in quantum theory as a consequence of the
wave-nature of subatomic particles, and is even more essential
in relativity theory, as we shall see, where the unification of
space and time implies that the being of matter cannot be
separated from its activity. The properties of subatomic particles
can therefore only be understood in a dynamic context; in
terms of movement, interaction and transformation.
According to quantum theory, particles are also waves, and
this implies that they behave in a very peculiar way. Whenever
a subatomic particle is confined to a small region of space, it
reacts to this confinement by moving around. The smaller the
region of confinement, the faster will the particle ‘jiggle’ around
in it. This behaviour is a typical ‘quantum effect’, a feature of
the subatomic world which has no macroscopic analogy. To
see how it comes about, we have to remember that particles
are represented, in quantum theory, by wave packets. As
discussed previously,** the length of such a wave packet
represents the uncertainty in the location of the particle. The
following wave pattern, for example, corresponds to a particle
located somewhere in the region X; where exactly we cannot
say with certainty. If we want to localize the particle more
precisely, i.e. if we want to confine it to a smaller region, we
have to squeeze its wave packet into this region (see diagram


below ). This, however, will affect the wavelength of the wave
packet, and consequently the velocity of the particle. As a result,
the particle will move around; the more it is confined, the faster
it will move.

The tendency of particles to react to confinement with
motion implies a fundamental ‘restlessness’ of matter which is
characteristic of the subatomic world. In this world, most of
the material particles are bound to the molecular, atomic and
nuclear structures, and therefore are not at rest but have an
inherent tendency to move about-they are intrinsically
restless. According to quantum theory, matter is thus never
quiescent, but always in a state of motion. Macroscopically,
the material objects around us may seem passive and inert,
but when we magnify such a ‘dead’ piece of stone or metal


we see that it is full of activity. The closer we look at it, the
more alive it appears. All the material objects in our environ-
ment are made of atoms which link up with each other in
various ways to form an enormous variety of molecular
structures which are not rigid and motionless, but oscillate
according to their temperature and in harmony with the
thermal vibrations of their environment. In the vibrating atoms,
the electrons are bound to the atomic nuclei by electric forces
which try to keep them as close as possible, and they respond
to this confinement by whirling around extremely fast. In the
nuclei, finally, the protons and neutrons are pressed into a
minute volume by the strong nuclear forces, and consequently
race about with unimaginable velocities.
Modern physics, then, pictures matter not at all as passive
and inert, but as being in a continuous dancing and vibrating
motion whose rhythmic patterns are determined by the
molecular, atomic and nuclear structures. This is also the way
in which the Eastern mystics see the material world. They all
emphasize that the universe has to be grasped dynamically,
as it moves, vibrates and dances; that nature is not in a static,
but a dynamic equilibrium. In the words of a Taoist text,
The stillness in stillness is not the real stillness. Only
when there is stillness in movement can the spiritual
rhythm appear which pervades heaven and earth.8
In physics, we recognize the dynamic nature of the universe
not only when we go to small dimensions-to the world of
atoms and nuclei-but also when we turn to large dimensions-
to the world of stars and galaxies. Through our powerful tele-
scopes we observe a universe in ceaseless motion. Rotating
clouds of hydrogen gas contract to form stars, heating up in
the process until they become burning fires in the sky. When
they have reached that stage, they still continue to rotate,
some of them ejecting material into space which spirals out-
wards and condenses into planets circling around the star.
Eventually, after millions of years, when most of its hydrogen
fuel is used up, a star expands, and then contracts again in the
final gravitational collapse. This collapse may involve gigantic
explosions, and may even turn the star into a black hole. All

these activities-the formation of stars out of interstellar gas
clouds, their contraction and subsequent expansion, and their
final collapse-can all actually be observed somewhere in the
skies.
The spinning, contracting, expanding or exploding stars
cluster into galaxies of various shapes-flat discs, spheres,
spirals, etc.-which, again, are not motionless but rotate. Our
galaxy, the Milky Way, is an immense disc of stars and gas
turning in space like a huge wheel, so that all its stars-in-
cluding the Sun and its planets-move around the galaxy’s
centre. The universe is, in fact, full of galaxies strewn through
all the space we can see; all spinning like our own.
When we study the universe as a whole, with its millions of
galaxies, we have reached the largest scale of space and time;
and again, at that cosmic level, we discover that the universe
is not static-it is expanding! This has been one of the most
important discoveries in modern astronomy. A detailed analysis
of the light received from distant galaxies has shown that the
whole swarm of galaxies expands and that it does so in a well
orchestrated way; the recession velocity of any galaxy we
observe is proportional to the galaxy’s distance. The more
distant the galaxy, the faster it moves away from us; at double
the distance, the recession velocity will also double. This is
true not only for distances measured from our galaxy, but
applies to any point of reference. Whichever galaxy you happen
to be in, you will observe the other galaxies rushing away from
you; nearby galaxies at several thousand miles per second,
farther ones at higher speeds, and the farthest at velocities
approaching the speed of light. The light from galaxies beyond
that distance will never reach us, because they move away
from us faster than the speed of light. Their light is-in the
words of Sir Arthur Eddington-‘like a runner on an expanding
track with the winning post receding faster than he can run’.
To have a better idea of the way in which the universe
expands, we have to remember that the proper framework for
studying its large-scale features is Einstein’s general theory of
relativity. According to this theory, space is not ‘flat’, but is
‘curved’, and the precise way in which it is curved is related to
the distribution of matter by Einstein’s field equations. These
equations can be used to determine the structure of the

universe as a whole; they are the starting point of modern
cosmology.
When we talk about an expanding universe in the framework
of general relativity, we mean an expansion in a higher dimen-
sion. Like the concept of curved space, we can only visualize
such a concept with the help of a two-dimensional analogy.
Imagine a balloon with a large number of dots on its surface.
The balloon represents the universe, its two-dimensional
curved surface representing the three-dimensional curved

space, and the dots on the surface the galaxies in that space.
When the balloon is blown up, all the distances between the
dots increase. Whichever dot you choose to sit on, all the other
dots will move away from you. The universe expands in the
same way: whichever galaxy an observer happens to be in,
the other galaxies will all move away from him.
An obvious question to be asked about the expanding
universe is: how did it all start? From the relation between the
distance of a galaxy and its recession velocity-which is
known as Hubble’s law-one can calculate the starting point
of the expansion, in other words, the age of the universe.
Assuming that there has been no change in the rate of expan-
sion, which is by no means certain, one arrives at an age of
the order of 10,000 million years. This, then, is the age of the
universe. Most cosmologists believe today that the universe
came into being in a highly dramatic event about 10,000
million years ago, when its total mass exploded out of a small

primeval fireball. The present expansion of the universe is seen
as the remaining thrust of this initial explosion. According to
this ‘big-bang’ model, the moment of the big bang marked
the beginning of the universe and the beginning of space and
time. If we want to know what happened before that moment,
we run-again-into severe difficulties of thought and language.
-It-r the words of Sir Bernard Lovell,
There we reach the great barrier of thought because we
begin to struggle with the concepts of time and space
before they existed in terms of our everyday experience.
I feel as though I’ve suddenly driven into a great fog
barrier where the familiar world has disappeared.g
As far as the future of the expanding universe is concerned,
Einstein’s equations do not provide a unique answer. They
allow for several different solutions corresponding to different
models of the universe. Some models predict that the expansion
will continue for ever; according to others, it is slowing down
and will eventually change into a contraction. These models
describe an oscillating universe, expanding for billions of
years, then contracting until its total mass has condensed into
a small ball of matter, then expanding again, and so on without
end.
This idea of a periodically expanding and contracting universe,
which involves a scale of time and space of vast proportions,
has arisen not only in modern cosmology, but also in ancient
Indian mythology. Experiencing the universe as an organic and
rhythmically moving cosmos, the Hindus were able to develop
evolutionary cosmologies which come very close to our modern
scientific models. One of these cosmologies is based on the
H i n d u m y t h o f / i / a - t h e d i v i n e p l a y - i n w h i c h Brahman
transforms himself into the world.* Lila is a rhythmic play
which goes on in endless cycles, the One becoming the
many and the many returning into the One. In the Bhagavad
Cita, the god Krishna describes this rhythmic play of creation
in the following words:

At the end of the night of time all things return to my
nature; and when the new day of time begins I bring them
again into light.
Thus through my nature I bring forth all creation and
this rolls around in the circles of time.
But I am not bound by this vast work of creation. I am and
I watch the drama of works.
I watch and in its work of creation nature brings forth all
that moves and moves not: and thus the revolutions of
the world go round.‘0
The Hindu sages were not afraid to identify this rhythmic
divine play with the evolution of the cosmos as a whole. They
pictured the universe as periodically expanding and con-
tracting and gave the name kalpa to the unimaginable time
span between the beginning and the end of one creation. The
scale of this ancient myth is indeed staggering; it has taken
the human mind more than two thousand years to come up
again with a similar concept.
From the world of the very large, from the expanding cosmos,
let us now return to the world of the infinitely small. Physics in
the twentieth century has been characterized by an ever-
progressing penetration into this world of submicroscopic
dimensions, down into the realms of atoms, nuclei and their
constituents. This exploration of the submicroscopic world
has been motivated by one basic question which has occupied
and stimulated human thought throughout the ages: what is
matter made of? Ever since the beginning of natural philosophy,
man has speculated about this question, trying to find the
‘basic stuff’ of which all matter is made; but only in our century
has it been possible to seek an answer by undertaking experi-
ments. With the help of a highly sophisticated technology,
physicists were able to explore first the structure of atoms,
finding that they consisted of nuclei and electrons, and then
the structure of the atomic nuclei which were found to consist
of protons and neutrons, commonly called nucleons. In the
last two decades, they have gone yet another step farther and


have begun to investigate the structure of the nucleons-the
constituents of the atomic nuclei-which, again, do not seem
to be the ultimate elementary particles, but seem to be
composed of other entities.
The first step in the penetration into ever deeper layers of
matter-the exploration of the world of atoms-has led to
several profound modifications of our view of matter which
have been discussed in the previous chapters. The second step
was the penetration of the world of atomic nuclei and their
constituents, and it has forced us to change our views in a
way which is no less profound. In this world, we deal with
dimensions which are a hundred thousand times smaller than
atomic dimensions, and consequently the particles confined to
such small dimensions move considerably faster than those
confined to atomic structures. They move, in fact, so fast that
they can only be described adequately in the framework of
the special theory of relativity. To understand the properties
and interactions of subatomic particles, it is thus necessary to
use a framework which takes into account both quantum
theory and relativity theory, and it is relativity theory which
forces us to modify our view of matter once more.
The characteristic feature of the relativistic framework is,
as mentioned previously, that it unifies basic concepts which
seemed totally unrelated before. One of the most important
examples is the equivalence of mass and energy which is
expressed mathematically by Einstein’s famous equation
E=mc*. To understand the profound significance of this
equivalence, we first have to understand the meaning of energy,
and the meaning of mass.
Energy is one of the most important concepts used in the
description of natural phenomena. As in everyday life, we say
that a body has energy when it has the capacity for doing
work. This energy can take a great variety of forms. It can be
energy of motion, energy of heat, gravitational energy, electrical
energy, chemical energy, and so on. Whatever the form is,
it can be used to do work. A stone, for example, can be given
gravitational energy by lifting it up to some height. When
it is dropped from that height, its gravitational energy is
transformed into energy of motion (‘kinetic energy’), and when
the stone hits the ground it can do work by breaking some-

thing. Taking a more constructive example, electrical energy
or chemical energy can be transformed into heat energy and
used for domestic purposes. In physics, energy is always
associated with some process, or some kind of activity, and its
fundamental importance lies in the fact that the total energy
involved in a process is always conserved. It may change its
form in the most complicated way, but none of it can get lost.
The conservation of energy is one of the most fundamental
laws of physics. It governs all known natural phenomena and
no violation of the law has so far been observed.
The mass of a body, on the other hand, is a measure of its
weight, i.e. of the pull of gravity on the body. Besides that, mass
measures the inertia of an object, i.e. its resistance against
being accelerated. Heavy objects are harder to accelerate
than light objects, a fact which is well known to anybody who
has ever pushed a car. In classical physics, mass was further-
more associated with an indestructible material substance,
i.e. with the ‘stuff’ of which all things were thought to be made.
Like energy, it was believed to be rigorously conserved, so that
no mass could ever get lost.
Now, relativity theory tells us that mass is nothing but a
form of energy. Energy can not only take the various forms
known in classical physics, but can also be locked up in the
mass of an object. The amount of energy contained, for
example, in a particle is equal to the particle’s mass, m, times
c2, the square of the speed of light; thus
Once it is seen to be a form of energy, mass is no longer
required to be indestructible, but can be transformed into other
forms of energy. This can happen when subatomic particles
collide with one another. In such collisions, particles can be
destroyed and the energy contained in their masses can be
transformed into kinetic energy, and distributed among the
other particles participating in the collision. Conversely, when
particles collide with very high velocities, their kinetic energy
can be used to form the masses of new particles. The photo-

graph below shows an extreme example of such a collision: a
proton enters the bubble chamber from the left, knocks an
electron out of an atom (spiral track), and then collides with

another proton to create sixteen new particles in the collision
process.
The creation and destruction of material particles is one of
the most impressive consequences of the equivalence of mass
and energy. In the collision processes of high-energy physics,
mass is no longer conserved. The colliding particles can be
destroyed and their masses may be transformed partly into
the masses, and partly into the kinetic energies of the newly
created particles. Only the total energy involved in such a
process, that is, the total kinetic energy plus the energy
contained in all the masses, is conserved. The collisions of
subatomic particles are our main tool to study their properties
and the relation between mass and energy is essential for
their description. It has been verified innumerable times and
particle physicists are completely familiar with the equivalence
of mass and energy; so familiar, in fact, that they measure
the masses of particles in the corresponding energy units.
The discovery that mass is nothing but a form of energy has
forced us to modify our concept of a particle in an essential
way. In modern physics, mass is no longer associated with a
material substance, and hence particles are not seen as con-
sisting of any basic ‘stuff’, but as bundles of energy. Since
energy, however, is associated with activity, with processes,
the implication is that the nature of subatomic particles is]

intrinsically dynamic. To understand this better, we must
remember that these particles can only be conceived in re-
lativistic terms, that is, in terms of a framework where space and
time are fused into a four-dimensional continuum. The particles
must not be pictured as static three-dimensional objects, like
billiard balls or grains of sand, but rather as four-dimensional
entities in space-time. Their forms have to be understood
dynamically, as forms in space and time. Subatomic particles
are dynamic patterns which have a space aspect and a time
aspect. Their space aspect makes them appear as objects
with a certain mass, their time aspect as processes involving
the equivalent energy.
These dynamic patterns, or ‘energy bundles’, form the stable
nuclear, atomic and molecular structures which build up
matter and give it its macroscopic solid aspect, thus making us
believe that it is made of some material substance. At the
macroscopic level, this notion of substance is a useful approxi-
mation, but at the atomic level it no longer makes sense. Atoms
consist of particles and these particles are not made of any
material stuff. When we observe them, we never see any
substance; what we observe are dynamic patterns continually
changing into one another-a continuous dance of energy.
Quantum theory has shown that particles are not isolated
grains of matter, but are probability patterns, interconnections
in an inseparable cosmic web. Relativity theory, so to speak,
has made these patterns come alive by revealing their in-
trinsically dynamic character. It has shown that the activity of
matter is the very essence of its being. The particles of the
subatomic world are not only active in the sense of moving
around very fast; they themselves are processes! The existence
of matter and its activity cannot be separated. They are but
different aspects of the same space-time reality.
It has been argued in the previous chapter that the awareness
of the ‘interpenetration’ of space and time has led the Eastern
mystics to an intrinsically dynamic world view. A study of their
writings reveals that they conceive the world not only in terms
of movement, flow and change, but also seem to have a strong
intuition for the ‘space-time’ character of material objects
which is so typical of relativistic physics. Physicists have to
take into account the unification of space and time when they

study the subatomic world and, consequently, they view the
objects of this world-the particles-not statically, but
dynamically, in terms of energy, activity and processes. The
Eastern mystics, in their non-ordinary states of consciousness,
seem to be aware of the interpenetration of space and time at
a macroscopic level, and thus they see the macroscopic
objects in a way which is very similar to the physicists’ con-
ception of subatomic particles. This is particularly striking in
Buddhism. One of the principal teachings of the Buddha was
that ‘all compounded things are impermanent’. In the original
Pali version of this famous saying,” the term used for ‘things’
is sankhara (Sanskrit: samskara), a word which means first of all
‘an event’ or ‘a happening’-also ‘a deed’, ‘an act’-and only
secondarily ‘an existing thing’. This clearly shows that Buddhists
haveadynamic conception of things asever-changing processes.
In the words of D. T. Suzuki,
Buddhists have conceived an object as an event and not
as a thing or substance . . . The Buddhist conception of
‘things’ as samskara (or sankhara), that is, as ‘deeds’, or
‘events’, makes it clear that Buddhists understand our
experience in terms of time and movement.12
Like modern physicists, Buddhists see all objects as processes
in a universal flux and deny the existence of any material
substance. This denial is one of the most characteristic features
of all schools of Buddhist philosophy. It is also characteristic of
Chinese thought which developed a similar view of things as
transitory stages in the ever-flowing Tao and was more con-
cerned with their interrelations than with their reduction to a
fundamental substance. While European philosophy tended
to find reality in substance,’ writes Joseph Needham, ‘Chinese
philosophy tended to find it in relation.“3
In the dynamic world views of Eastern mysticism and of
modern physics, then, there is no place for static shapes, or
for any material substance. The basic elements of the universe
are dynamic patterns; transitory stages in the ‘constant flow
of transformation and change’, as Chuang Tzu calls it.
According to our present knowledge of matter, its basic
patterns are the subatomic particles, and the understanding of

their properties and interactions is the principal aim of modern
fundamental physics. We know today over two hundred
particles, most of them being created artificially in collision
processes and living only an extremely short time; far less than
a millionth of a second! It is thus quite obvious that these
short-lived particles represent merely transitory patterns of
dynamic processes. The main questions with regard to these
patterns, or particles, are the following. What are their dis-
tinguishing features? Are they composite and, if so, what do
they consist of or-better-what other patterns do they
involve? How do they interact with one another, i.e. what are
the forces between them? Lastly, if the particles themselves
are processes, what kind of processes are they?
We have become aware that in particle physics all these
questions are inseparably connected. Because of the relativistic
nature of subatomic particles, we cannot understand their
properties without understanding their mutual interactions,
and because of the basjc interconnectedness of the subatomic
world we shall not understand any one particle before under-
standing all the others. The following chapters will show how
far we have come in understanding the particles’ properties
and interactions. Although we are still lacking a complete
quantum-relativistic theory of the subatomic world, several
partial theories and models have been developed which
describe some aspects of this world very successfully. A dis-
cussion of the most important of these models and theories
will show that they all involve philosophical conceptions which
are in striking agreement with those in Eastern mysticism.
