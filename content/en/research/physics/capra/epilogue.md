The Eastern religious philosophies are concerned with timeless
mystical knowledge which lies beyond reasoning and cannot
be adequately expressed in words. The relation of this knowledge
to modern physics is but one of its many aspects and, like all
the others, it cannot be demonstrated conclusively but has to
be experienced in a direct intuitive way. What I hope to have
achieved, to some extent, therefore, is not a rigorous demonstra-
tion, but rather to have given the reader an opportunity to
relive, every now and then, an experience which has become
for me a source of continuing joy and inspiration; that the
principal theories and models of modern physics lead to a
view of the world which is internally consistent and in perfect
harmony with the views of Eastern mysticism.
For those who have experienced this harmony, the sig-
nificance of the parallels between the world views of physicists
and mystics is beyond any doubt. The interesting question,
then, is not whether these parallels exist, but why; and, further-
more, what their existence implies.
In trying to understand the mystery of Life, man has followed
many different approaches. Among them, there are the ways
of the scientist and mystic, but there are many more; the ways
of poets, children, clowns, shamans, to name but a few. These
ways have resulted in different descriptions of the world, both
verbal and non-verbal, which emphasize different aspects.
All are valid and useful in the context in which they arose. All
of them, however, are only descriptions, or representations, of
reality and are therefore limited. None can give a complete
picture of the world.
The mechanistic world view of classical physics is useful for


the description of the kind of physical phenomena we en-
counter in our everyday life and thus appropriate for dealing
with our daily environment, and it has also proved extremely
successful as a basis for technology. It is inadequate, however,
for the description of physical phenomena in the submicro-
scopic realm. Opposed to the mechanistic conception of the
world is the view of the mystics which may be epitomized by
the word ‘organic’, as it regards all phenomena in the universe
as integral parts of an inseparable harmonious whole. This
world view emerges in the mystical traditions from meditative
states of consciousness. In their description of the world, the
mystics use concepts which are derived from these non-
ordinary experiences and are, in general, inappropriate for a
scientific description of macroscopic phenomena. The organic
world view is not advantageous for constructing machines,
nor for coping with the technical problems in an overpopulated
world.
In everyday life, then, both the mechanistic and the organic
views of the universe are valid and useful; the one for science
and technology, the other for a balanced and fulfilled spiritual
life. Beyond the dimensions of our everyday environment,
however, the mechanistic concepts lose their validity and have
to be replaced by organic concepts which are very similar to
those used by the mystics. This is the essential experience of
modern physics which has been the subject of our discussion.
Physics in the twentieth century has shown that the concepts
of the organic world view, although of little value for science
and technology on the human scale, become extremely useful
at the atomic and subatomic level. The organic view, therefore,
seems to be more fundamental than the mechanistic. Classical
physics, which is based on the latter, can be derived from
quantum theory, which implies the former, whereas the reverse
is not possible. This seems to give a first indication why we
might expect the world views of modern physics and Eastern
mysticism to be similar. Both emerge when man enquires into
the essential nature of things- into the deeper realms of matter
in physics; into the deeper realms of consciousness in mysticism
-when he discovers a different reality behind the superficial
mechanistic appearance of everyday life.

The parallels between the views of physicists and mystics

become even more plausible when we recall the other similarities
which exist in spite of their different approaches. To begin with,
their method is thoroughly empirical. Physicists derive their
knowledge from experiments; mystics from meditative insights.
Both are observations, and in both fields these observations
are acknowledged as the only source of knowledge. The object
of observation is of course very different in the two cases. The
mystic looks within and explores his or her consciousness at
its various levels, which include the body as the physical
manifestation of the mind. The experience of one’s body is,
in fact, emphasized in many Eastern traditions and is often seen
as the key to the mystical experience of the world. When we
are healthy, we do not feel any separate parts in our body but
are aware of it as an integrated whole, and this awareness
generates a feeling of well-being and happiness. In a similar
way, the mystic is aware of the wholeness of the entire cosmos
which is experienced as an extension of the body. In the words
of Lama Covinda,
To the enlightened man . . . whose consciousness embraces
the universe, to him the universe becomes his ‘body’,
while his physical body becomes a manifestation of the
Universal Mind, his inner vision an expression of the highest
reality, and his speech an expression of eternal truth and
mantric power.’
In contrast to the mystic, the physicist begins his enquiry
into the essential nature of things by studying the material
world. Penetrating into ever deeper realms of matter, he has
become aware of the essential unity of all things and events.
More than that, he has also learnt that he himself and his
consciousness are an integral part of this unity. Thus the mystic
and the physicist arrive at the same conclusion; one starting
from the inner realm, the other from the outer world. The
harmony between their views confirms the ancient Indian
wisdom that Brahman, the ultimate reality without, is identical
to Atman, the reality within.
A further similarity between the ways of the physicist and
mystic is the fact that their observations take place in realms
which are inaccessible to the ordinary senses. In modern physics,

these are the realms of the atomic and subatomic world; in
mysticism they are non-ordinary states of consciousness in
which the sense world is transcended. Mystics often talk about
experiencing higher dimensions in which impressions of
different centres of consciousness are integrated into a
harmonious whole. A similar situation exists in modern physics
where a four-dimensional ‘space-time’ formalism has been
developed which unifies concepts and observations belonging
to different categories in the ordinary three-dimensional world.
In both fields, the multi-dimensional experiences transcend the
sensory world and are therefore almost impossible to express
in ordinary language.
We see that the ways of the modern physicist and the
Eastern mystic, which seem at first totally unrelated, have, in
fact, much in common. It should not be too surprising, there-
fore, that there are striking parallels in their descriptions of the
world. Once these parallels between Western science and
Eastern mysticism are accepted, a number of questions will
arise concerning their implications. Is modern science, with all
its sophisticated machinery, merely rediscovering ancient
wisdom, known to the Eastern sages for thousands of years?
Should physicists, therefore, abandon the scientific method
and begin to meditate? Or can there be a mutual influence
between science and mysticism; perhaps even a synthesis?
I think all these questions have to be answered in the
negative. I see science and mysticism as two complementary
manifestations of the human mind; of its rational and intuitive
faculties. The modern physicist experiences the world through
an extreme specialization of the rational mind; the mystic
through an extreme specialization of the intuitive mind. The
two approaches are entirely different and involve far more than
a certain view of the physical world. However, they are com-
plementary, as we have learned to say in physics. Neither is
comprehended in the other, nor can either of them be reduced
to the other, but both of them are necessary, supplementing
one another for a fuller understanding of the world. To para-
phrase an old Chinese saying, mystics understand the roots of
the Tao but not its branches; scientists understand its branches
but not its roots. Sciencedoes not need mysticism and mysticism
does not need science; but man needs both. Mystical experi-

ence is necessary to understand the deepest nature of things,
and science is essential for modern life. What we need, there-
,fore, is not a synthesis but a dynamic interplay between
mystical intuition and scientific analysis.
So far, this has not been achieved in our society. At present,
our attitude is too yang-to use again Chinese phraseology-
too rational, male and aggressive. Scientists themselves are a
typical example. Although their theories are leading to a world
view which is similar to that of the mystics, it is striking how
littlethis hasaffected theattitudesof most scientists. In mysticism,
knowledge cannot be separated from a certain way of life
which becomes its living manifestation. To acquire mystical
knowledge means to undergo a transformation; one could
even say that the knowledge is the transformation. Scientific
knowledge, on the other hand, can often stay abstract and
theoretical. Thus most of today’s physicists do not seem to
realize the philosophical, cultural and spiritual implications of
their theories. Many of them actively support a society which
is still based on the mechanistic, fragmented world view,
without seeing that science points beyond such a view, towards
a oneness of the universe which includes not only our natural
environment but also our fellow human beings. I believe that
the world view implied by modern physics is inconsistent with
our present society, which does not reflect the harmonious
interrelatedness we observe in nature. To achieve such a state
of dynamic balance, a radically different social and economic
structure will be needed: a cultural revolution in the true sense
of the word. The survival of our whole civilization may depend
on whether we can bring about such a change. It will depend,
ultimately, on our ability to adopt some of the yin attitudes of
Eastern mysticism; to experience the wholeness of nature and
the art of living with it in harmony.
