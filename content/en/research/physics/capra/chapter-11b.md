In Tantric Buddhism, the male/female polarity is often illustrated with the help of sexual symbols. 

Intuitive wisdom is seen as the passive, female quality of human nature, love and compassion as the active, male quality, and the union of both in the process of enlightenment is represented by ecstatic sexual embraces of male and female deities. 

The Eastern mystics affirm that such a union of one’s male and female modes can only be experienced on a higher plane of consciousness where the realm of thought and language is transcended and all
opposites appear as a dynamic unity. 

A similar plane has been reached in modern physics. The exploration of the subatomic world
has revealed a reality which repeatedly transcends language
and reasoning, and the unification of concepts which had
hitherto seemed opposite and irreconcilable turns out to be
one of the most startling features of this new reality. 

These seemingly irreconcilable concepts are generally not the ones the Eastern mystics are concerned with-although sometimes they are-but their unification at a non-ordinary level of reality
provides a parallel to Eastern mysticism. 

Modern physicists should therefore be able to gain insights into some of the
central teachings of the Far East by relating them to experiences
in their own field. A small but growing number of young
physicists have indeed found thisa most valuableand stimulating
approach to Eastern mysticism.

Examples of the unification of opposite concepts in modern physics can be found at the subatomic level, where particles are both destructible and indestructible; where matter is
both continuous and discontinuous, and force and matter are
but different aspects of the same phenomenon. In all these
examples, which will be discussed extensively in subsequent
chapters, it turns out that the framework of opposite concepts,
derived from our everyday experience, is too narrow for the
world of subatomic particles. 

Relativity theory is crucial for the description of this world, and in the ‘relativistic’ framework the classical concepts are transcended by going to a higher dimension, the four-dimensional space-time. 

Space and time themselves are two concepts which had seemed entirely different, but have been unified in relativistic physics. This fundamental unity is the basis of the unification of the opposite concepts mentioned above. Like the unity of opposites experienced by the mystics, it takes place on a ‘higher plane’, i.e. in a higher dimension, and like that experienced by the mystics
it is a dynamic unity, because the relativistic space-time reality
is an intrinsically dynamic reality where objects are also
processes and all forms are dynamic patterns.

To experience the unification of seemingly separate entities in a higher dimension we do not need relativity theory. 

It can also be experienced by going from one to two dimensions, or
from two to three. In the example of a circular motion and its
projection given opposite the opposite poles of the oscillation
in one dimension (along a line) are unified in the circular movement in 2 dimensions (in one plane). The drawing overleaf represents another example, involving a transition from two
to three dimensions. 

It shows a ‘doughnut’ ring cut horizontally by a plane. In the two dimensions of that plane, the surfaces of the cut appear as two completely separate discs, but in three
dimensions they are recognized as being parts of one and the
same object. 

A similar unification of entities which seem
separate and irreconcilable is achieved in relativity theory by
going from three to four dimensions. The four-dimensional
world of relativistic physics is the world where force and matter
are unified; where matter can appear as discontinuous particles
or as a continuous field. In these cases, however, we can no
longer visualize the unity very well. Physicists can ‘experience’
the four-dimensional space-time world through the abstract
mathematical formalism of their theories, but their visual
imagination-like everybody else’s-is limited to the three-dimensional world of the senses. Our language and thought patterns have evolved in this three-dimensional world and
therefore we find it extremely hard to deal with the four-
dimensional reality of relativistic physics.

Eastern mystics, on the other hand, seem to be able to
experience a higher-dimensional reality directly and concretely. In the state of deep meditation, they can transcend the
three-dimensional world of everyday life, and experience a
totally different reality where all opposites are unified into an
organic whole. When the mystics try to express this experience
in words, they are faced with the same problems as the physicists
trying to interpret the multidimensional reality of relativistic
physics. 

In the words of Lama Covinda, An experience of higher dimensionality is achieved by
integration of experiences of different centres and levels
of consciousness. Hence the indescribability of certain
experiencesof meditation on the planeof three-dimensional
consciousness and within a system of logic which reduces
the possibilities of expression by imposing further limits
upon the process of thinking.5

The four-dimensional world of relativity theory is not the only example in modern physics where seemingly contradictory and irreconcilable concepts are seen to be nothing more than
different aspects of the same reality. Perhaps the most famous
case of such a unification of contradictory concepts is that of
the concepts of particles and waves in atomic physics.
At the atomic level, matter has a dual aspect: it appears as
particles and as waves. Which aspect it shows depends on the

situation. In some situations the particle aspect is dominant,
in others the particles behave more like waves; and this dual
nature is also exhibited by light and all other electromagnetic
radiation. Light, for example, is emitted and absorbed in the
form of ‘quanta’, or photons, but when these particles of light
travel through space they appear as vibrating electric and
magnetic fields which show all the characteristic behaviour
of waves. Electrons are normally considered to be particles,
and yet when a beam of these particles is sent through a small
slit it is diffracted just like a beam of light-in other words
electrons, too, behave like waves.

This dual aspect of matter and radiation is indeed most
startling and gave rise to many of the ‘quantum koans’ which
led to the formulation of quantum theory. The picture of a
wave which is always spread out in space is fundamentally
different from the particle picture which implies a sharp location.
It has taken physicists a long time to accept the fact that matter
manifests itself in ways which seem to be mutually exclusive;
that particles are also waves, waves also particles.

Looking at the two pictures, a lay person might be tempted to think that the contradiction can be resolved by saying that the picture on the right-hand side simply represents a particle
moving in a wave pattern. 

This argument, however, rests on a misunderstanding of the nature of waves. Particles moving in
wave patterns do not exist in nature. In a water wave, for example,
the water particles do not move along with the wave but move
in circles as the wave passes by. Similarly, the air particles in a
sound wave merely oscillate back and forth, but do not pro-
pagate along with the wave. What is transported along the
wave is the disturbance causing the wave phenomenon, but
not any material particle. In quantum theory, therefore, we do
not speak about a particle’s trajectory when we say that the
particle is also a wave. What we mean is that the wave pattern
as a whole is a manifestation of the particle. The picture of

travelling waves is thus totally different from that of travelling
particles; as different-in the words of Victor Weisskopf-‘as
the notion of waves on a lake from that of a school of fish
swimming in the same direction’.6
