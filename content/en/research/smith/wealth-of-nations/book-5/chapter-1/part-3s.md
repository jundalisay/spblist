<!-- ## Philosophy -->

{{< s v="151" >}} The ancient Greek philosophy was divided into 3 great branches: 

1. Physics or natural philosophy
2. Ethics or moral philosophy
3. Logic

**This general division is perfectly agreeable to the nature of things.**


### Physics

{{< s v="152" >}} The great phenomena of nature necessarily make people curious about their causes.

<!-- excite wonder:
- the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, eclipses, comets, thunder, lightning, and extraordinary meteors, and
- the generation, life, growth, and dissolution of plants and animals. -->

Superstition first tried to satisfy this curiosity by referring them all to the <!-- agency of the --> gods.

Afterwards, philosophy tried to account for them from more familiar causes.
- The first recorded philosophers were natural philosophers.

<!-- Those great phenomena are the first objects of human curiosity.
- The science which pretends to explain them must naturally have been the first branch of philosophy.
- Accordingly,  -->


### Ethics

{{< s v="153" >}} In every age and country, men must have attended to one another's characters, designs, and actions.

People then laid many reputable rules and maxims for the conduct of human life. This was then approved of by common consent.

 <!-- must have been laid down and  -->

As soon as writing came into fashion, wise men would naturally write those those maxims down and multiply them.

<!--  , and
- to express their own sense of what was proper or improper conduct sometimes in:  -->

- The artificial form of writing them was in the form of apologues, like Aesop's fables,
- The simpler form was of apophthegms or wise sayings like:
  - The Proverbs of Solomon
  - The verses of Theognis and Phocyllides
  - The works of Hesiod

<!-- They might continue in this way for a long time merely to multiply those maxims of prudence and morality, without even attempting to: -->

These did not:
- arrange them in any methodical order, and
- connect them by general principles as done in natural pholosophy

 <!-- from which they were all deducible, like effects from their natural causes. -->

<!-- There was a beautiful, systemic arrangement of their different observations, connected by a few common principles. This was first seen in the rude ancient essays about the system of natural philosophy. Something of the same kind was afterwards attempted in morals. -->

<!-- - They were connected together by a few common principles, in the same manner attempted in the arrangement and connection of natural phenomena. -->

In time, the maxims of common life were arranged in some methodical order. This led to moral philosophy as the science which explains those connecting principles.

<!-- pretends to investigate and is called . -->


### Logic

{{< s v="154" >}} Different authors gave different systems of natural and moral philosophy.

<!-- But the arguments which supported those systems were frequently very slender probabilities at best.

Sometimes those arguments were mere sophisms.

Their only foundation was the inaccuracy and ambiguity of common language. -->

Speculative systems have always been adopted for frivolous reasons.
- Gross sophistry has never influenced mankind's opinions, except in matters of philosophy and speculation.
- Gross sophistry was frequently the greatest in philosophy and speculation.

The patrons of each system of natural and moral philosophy naturally tried to expose the weakness of the arguments of opposing systems.

In examining those arguments, they had to consider the difference between:
- a probable and a demonstrative argument, and
- a fallacious and a conclusive one.


Logic is the science of the general principles of good and bad reasoning.
- It arose out of the scrutiny of this examination.
- It was originally posterior to physics and ethics.
- It was commonly taught in most of the ancient schools of philosophy, before physics and ethics.*

{{< n n="This is also why Superhysics Fundamentals is taught before Material Superphysics or Spiritual Superphysics">}}


The student was supposed thoughtto understand the difference between good and bad reasoning before he could reason on important subjects.



### Metaphysics

{{< s v="155" >}} This ancient division of philosophy into 3 parts was changed into 5 parts in most European universities.


{{< s v="156" >}} In the ancient philosophy, whatever concerned the nature of the human mind or the Deity was a part of physics.

<!-- Those beings were parts of the great system of the universe.
- They produced the most important effects. -->

<!-- Whatever human reason could conclude about them made two very important chapters, of the science which pretended to give an account of the origin and revolutions of the great system of the universe. -->

But in European universities, philosophy was taught as subservient to theology.

<!-- It was natural to dwell longer on these two chapters than any other chapter of the science. -->

Physics was gradually extended and divided into:

<!-- many inferior chapters such as:
- the doctrine of spirits, and
  - This is a study where so little can be known.
- the doctrine of bodies.
  - This is a study where so much can be known.

In the end, the doctrine of spirits took up as much room in philosophy as the doctrine of bodies.

Those 2 doctrines made 2 distinct sciences. -->

1. Physics

2. Metaphysics or Pneumatics

This was opposed to Physics as the more sublime and useful science than Physics.

This is because Physics required experiment and observation which required careful attention which was neglected in those days. 

<!--  is capable of making so many useful discoveries.
- Experiment and observation was almost entirely neglected. -->

In contrast, Metaphysics had a few very simple and obvious truths that did not require careful attention.
- In fact, careful attention on these truths would lead to subtleties and sophisms.

<!-- was greatly cultivated

- The most careful attention of these truths can only lead to obscurity and uncertainty.
- It can only produce  -->


### Ontology

{{< s v="157" >}} Ontology was created out of the natural comparison between Physics and Metaphysics. 

<!-- When those two sciences were set in opposition to one another, the 

 them naturally created a third science called .
 -->

This is the science which studied the qualities common to both Metaphysics and Physics subjects.
- This cobweb was made up of subtleties and sophisms

 <!-- composed most of Metaphysics or Pneumatics and the whole of the cobweb of Ontology. -->
Ontology was sometimes also called Metaphysics*.

{{< n n="This is probably a result of Aristotle just as Epistemology is a result of Kant" >}}


{{< s v="158" >}} The most important branch of philosophy is moral philosophy.

The ancient moral philosophy investigated the happiness and perfection of a man considered, in the current life, as an individual and a member of:
- a family
- a state
- the great human society

<!-- In moral philosophy, the duties of human life were treated as subservient to the happiness and perfection of human life. -->

When moral and natural philosophy became subservient to theology, the duties of human life were treated as subservient to afterlife. 

<!-- the happiness of a life to come. -->

- In the ancient philosophy, virtue led to happiness in this life.
- But in the modern philosophy, virtue was frequently inconsistent with happiness in this life.
  - Heaven was to be earned only by:
    - penance and mortification, and
    - the austerities and abasement of a monk.
  - Heaven was not to be earned by the liberal, generous, and spirited conduct of a man.
  - Casuistry and an ascetic morality made up most of the moral philosophy of the schools.
  - In this way, moral philosophy became the most corrupted science.
