### 2.1 Hyperfine Structure of Hydrogen

The hyperfine structure of the spectral lines is a result of the coupling of J, the total angluar momentum of the electron, and the total angular momentum of the proton I~ to the total angular momentum of the system: F~ = J~ + I.

In case of the 1s groundstate of hydrogen, the interaction between the proton and electron spin leads to a singlet state with F = 0 and a triplet state with F = 1 and M = −1, 0, 1, see figure 2.1.

Without an external magnetic field, the transition frequency between these two levels is [6][7]:
νHF = 1420405751.7667 ± 0.0009 Hz
(2.1)

which is one of the most accurately measured quantities .

In a magnetic field however, the degenerated F = 1 level splits up, see figure 2.2, the energies of all four states shift. 

Therefore, in the presence of an external magnetic field not only one but several transitions can be observed in the hydrogen atom.

Regarding their behaviour in an inhomogeneous magnetic field, these states can be classified into low- and high-field seeking states (LFS and HFS).

The energy of the atom in a B-field shifts according to ∆E = −~μB magnetic moment will align paralell ((F,MF ) = (1,1) and (0,0)) or antiparallel ((F,MF ) = (1,−1) and (1,0)) to the B-field. If now a field gradient is added,


the atoms with parallel magnentic moment will tend to move toward higher field regions where they will have lower energies. For the states (F,MF ) = (1,−1) and (1,0) the opposite is true.

Note, that the order of levels is different for hydrogen and antihydrogen. An overview is given in table 2.1.



Limits

Particles and their interactions are well described by the standard model - but only at the currently accessible energy scales i.e. starting at the electroweak scale mW and being small compared to the Planck mass. 

At energies in order of Mp the standard model is no longer able to describe nature properly since gravity is not included [9].

In this energy region, the standard model is expected to be superseded by a more fundamental theory that connects quantum theory and gravitation consistently [10].

Accelerators of today cannot reach the Planck scale - but low energy manifestations of this underlying theory may exist which are suppressed at ’common’ energies.

Though these effects will be very small due to the energy difference between the low energy scale and the Planck scale and only high precision experiments might be able to detect them [9][10].


One of these manifestations of the underlying theory might be the violation of the CPT symmetry, a fundamental symmetry embedded in the stardard model.
