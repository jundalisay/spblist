The hypothesis of vortices is problematic. 

It says that:
- each planet by a radius drawn to the sun may describe areas proportional to the times of description
- the periodic times of the several parts of the vortices should observe the square of their distances from the sun
- the periodic times of the planets may obtain the 3/2th power of their distances from the sun
- the periodic times of the parts of the vortex should be as the 3/2th power of their distances

<!-- - the periodic times of the planets may obtain the sesquiplicate proportion of their distances from the sun the periodic times of the parts of the vortex should be in the sesquiplicate proportion of their distances. -->
- the smaller vortices may maintain their lesser revolutions around Saturn, Jupiter, and other planets, and swim quietly and undisturbed in the greater vortex of the sun
- the periodic times of the parts of the sun's vortex should be equal 
- the rotation of the sun and planets around their axes should correspond with the motions of their vortices, but recede far from all these proportions.

I have explained that the motions of the comets are very regular*. These:
- are governed by the same laws with the motions of the planets
- cannot be accounted for by the hypothesis of vortices as axes because coments have very elliptical orbits
- have a freedom that is incompatible with the notion of a vortex


{{< n n="Newton obviously didn't understand Descartes' explanation for comets. Yes, Descartes made a mistake in the speed of comets beyond Pluto, but that doesn't mean his entire system is wrong." >}}



Bodies thrown in our air experience air resistance. Withdraw the air and the resistance ceases. 

In a vacuum, a piece of tine and a piece of solid gold fall with equal speed. 

The same thing happens in outer space* where:
- there is no air to resist their motions
- all bodies, planets, and comets will constantly pursue their revolutions in orbits according to the laws above


{{< n n="Here, Newton confuses the invisible air-aether with physical air. Tine and solid gold fall at the same speed in a vacuum because there is a single vortex of the Earth that draws in the air-aether to the center in a straight line." >}}


The 6 planets revolve around the sun:
- in concentric circles,
- with motions directed towards the same parts, and
- almost in the same plane

The moons revolve around their planets:
- in concentric circles
- with the same direction of motion nearly in the planes of the orbits of those planets


But mere mechanical causes cannot cause those regular motions, since comets travel in very eccentric orbits.
- Their eccentric orbits lets them pass through the orbits of the planets quickly
- They move slowest in their aphelions where they are least disturbed by the planets' attractions

This most beautiful system can only come from an intelligent and powerful Being. 
- The One also dominates over the fixed stars, especially since their starlight is of the same nature as sunlight and these lights pass into all the other systems
- The One separated those stars to prevent them from falling into each other

This Being governs all things, not as the soul of the universe, but as Lord overall. 
- I call Him Lord God or Universal Ruler
- This is because God is a relative word, and has a respect to servants
- Deity is the dominion of God not over his own body, as those imagine who fancy God to be the soul of the universe, but over servants. 

The Supreme God is a Being eternal, infinite, absolutely perfect. 
- A Lord God is a perfect God with a dominion
- The word God usually signifies Lord, but every lord is not a God
- God means the dominion of a spiritual being
- Thus a dominion makes a God
- A true dominion means that the true God is living, intelligent, and powerful
- He is not eternity or infinity, but eternal and infinite
- He is not duration or space, but He endures and is present

Since every particle of space is always, and every indivisible moment of duration is every where, certainly the Maker and Lord of all things cannot be never and no where. 

Every soul that has perception is still the same indivisible person. 
- There are given successive parts in duration, co-existent parts in space, but neither the one nor the
other in the person of a man, or his thinking principle and much less

<!-- can they be found in the thinking substance of God. -->

Every man, so far as he is a thing that has perception, is one and the same man during his whole life. 

God is the same God, always and every where.

He is omnipresent not virtually only, but also substantially, for virtue cannot exist without substance.

All things are contained and moved in Him, yet neither affects the other. God suffers nothing from the motion of bodies. Bodies find no resistance from the omnipresence of God. 


We have no idea how God perceives things just as a blind man has no idea of colours. 

He has no body or shape. He cannot be seen, heard, nor touched. He should not be worshipped represented by any physical thing. We have ideas of His attributes, but we know nothing of His real substance. 

We see objects, but know nothing of their real inner  substances. Thus we can have no knowledge of the substance of God. 

We know Him only by his most wise and excellent contrivances of things, and final causes. We revere and adore him because of His dominion, as his servants.

Fate and Nature are God without His dominion. A blind metaphysical cause and effect is the same always and every where. But it cannot produce any variety. The diversity can only come from the ideas and will of a Being. 


What is the cause of gravity?

It must:
- proceed from a cause that penetrates to the very centres of the sun and planets, without suffering the least diminution of its force. 
- operate on the quantity of the solid matter which they contain, not according to the surface area as mechanical causes do
- it propagates its virtue on all sides to immense distances, decreasing always in the duplicate proportion of the distances.

Gravitation towards the sun is made up of the gravitations towards the particles of the sun.


But I have not been able to discover the cause of gravity from phenomena. I have no hypotheses because hypotheses have no place in experimental philosophy. 

To me, it is enough that gravity exists and that it accounts for all the motions of the the celestial bodies, and of our sea. 


A Spirit pervades and lies hidden in all gross bodies. Its action and force causes the particles of bodies to:
- mutually attract one another at near distances (electric bodies operate farther)
- cohere if contiguous
- emit light and heat bodies

All animal bodies move at the command of the will through the vibrations of this Spirit. 
- these vibrations travel from our sense organs to the brain
- from the brain to the muscles

My work can lay the foundation to discover how this Spirit operates.

<!-- The six primary planets are revolved about the sun in circles concentric with the sun, and with motions directed towards the same parts, and almost in the same plane. Ten moons are revolved about the earth, Jupiter and Saturn, in circles concentric with them, with the same direction of motion, and nearly in the planes of the orbits of those planets; but it is not to be conceived that mere mechanical causes could give birth to so many regular motions, since the comets range over all parts of the heavens in very eccentric orbits; for by that kind of motion they pass easily through the orbs of the planets, and with great rapidity; and in their aphelions, where they move the slowest, and are detained the longest, they recede to the greatest distances from each other, and thence suffer the least disturbance from their mutual attractions. This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being. And if the fixed stars are the centres of other like systems, these, being formed by the like wise counsel, must be all subject to the dominion of One; especially since the light of the fixed stars is of the same nature with the light of the sun, and from every system light passes into all the other systems: and lest the systems of the fixed stars should, by their gravity, fall on each other mutually, he hath placed those systems at immense distances one from another.

This Being governs all things, not as the soul of the world, but as Lord over all; and on account of his dominion he is wont to be called Lord God παντοκράτωρ, or Universal Ruler; for God is a relative word, and has a respect to servants; and Deity is the dominion of God not over his own body, as those imagine who fancy God to be the soul of the world, but over servants. The Supreme God is a Being eternal, infinite, absolutely perfect; but a being, however perfect, without dominion, cannot be said to be Lord God; for we say, my God, your God, the God of Israel, the God of Gods, and Lord of Lords; but we do not say, my Eternal, your Eternal, the Eternal of Israel, the Eternal of Gods; we do not say, my Infinite, or my Perfect: these are titles which have no respect to servants. The word God[1] usually signifies Lord; but every lord is not a God. It is the dominion of a spiritual being which constitutes a God: a true, supreme, or imaginary dominion makes a true, supreme, or imaginary God. And from his true dominion it follows that the true God is a living, intelligent, and powerful Being; and, from his other perfections, that he is supreme, or most perfect. He is eternal and infinite, omnipotent and omniscient; that is, his duration reaches from eternity to eternity; his presence from infinity to infinity; he governs all things, and knows all things that are or can be done. He is not eternity or infinity, but eternal and infinite; he is not duration or space, but he endures and is present. He endures for ever, and is every where present; and by existing always and every where, he constitutes duration and space. Since every particle of space is always, and every indivisible moment of duration is every where, certainly the Maker and Lord of all things cannot be never and no where. Every soul that has perception is, though in different times and in different organs of sense and motion, still the same indivisible person. There are given successive parts in duration, co-existent parts in space, but neither the one nor the other in the person of a man, or his thinking principle; and much less can they be found in the thinking substance of God. Every man, so far as he is a thing that has perception, is one and the same man during his whole life, in all and each of his organs of sense. God is the same God, always and every where. He is omnipresent not virtually only, but also substantially; for virtue cannot subsist without substance. In him[2] are all things contained and moved; yet neither affects the other: God suffers nothing from the motion of bodies; bodies find no resistance from the omnipresence of God. It is allowed by all that the Supreme God exists necessarily; and by the same necessity he exists always and every where. Whence also he is all similar, all eye, all ear, all brain, all arm, all power to perceive, to understand, and to act; but in a manner not at all human, in a manner not at all corporeal, in a manner utterly unknown to us. As a blind man has no idea of colours, so have we no idea of the manner by which the all-wise God perceives and understands all things. He is utterly void of all body and bodily figure, and can therefore neither be seen, nor heard, nor touched; nor ought he to be worshipped under the representation of any corporeal thing. We have ideas of his attributes, but what the real substance of any thing is we know not. In bodies, we see only their figures and colours, we hear only the sounds, we touch only their outward surfaces, we smell only the smells, and taste the savours; but their inward substances are not to be known either by our senses, or by any reflex act of our minds: much less, then, have we any idea of the substance of God. We know him only by his most wise and excellent contrivances of things, and final causes: we admire him for his perfections; but we reverence and adore him on account of his dominion: for we adore him as his servants; and a god without dominion, providence, and final causes, is nothing else but Fate and Nature. Blind metaphysical necessity, which is certainly the same always and every where, could produce no variety of things. All that diversity of natural things which we find suited to different times and places could arise from nothing but the ideas and will of a Being necessarily existing. But, by way of allegory, God is said to see, to speak, to laugh, to love, to hate, to desire, to give, to receive, to rejoice, to be angry, to fight, to frame, to work, to build; for all our notions of God are taken from the ways of mankind by a certain similitude, which, though not perfect, has some likeness, however. And thus much concerning God; to discourse of whom from the appearances of things, does certainly belong to Natural Philosophy.

Hitherto we have explained the phenomena of the heavens and of our sea by the power of gravity, but have not yet assigned the cause of this power. This is certain, that it must proceed from a cause that penetrates to the very centres of the sun and planets, without suffering the least diminution of its force; that operates not according to the quantity of the surfaces of the particles upon which it acts (as mechanical causes use to do), but according to the quantity of the solid matter which they contain, and propagates its virtue on all sides to immense distances, decreasing always in the duplicate proportion of the distances. Gravitation towards the sun is made up out of the gravitations towards the several particles of which the body of the sun is composed; and in receding from the sun decreases accurately in the duplicate proportion of the distances as far as the orb of Saturn, as evidently appears from the quiescence of the aphelions of the planets; nay, and even to the remotest aphelions of the comets, if those aphelions are also quiescent. But hitherto I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from phænomena, and I frame no hypotheses; for whatever is not deduced from the phænomena is to be called an hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, whether of occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction. Thus it was that the impenetrability, the mobility, and the impulsive force of bodies, and the laws of motion and of gravitation, were discovered. And to us it is enough that gravity does really exist, and act according to the laws which we have explained, and abundantly serves to account for all the motions of the celestial bodies, and of our sea.

And now we might add something concerning a certain most subtle Spirit which pervades and lies hid in all gross bodies; by the force and action of which Spirit the particles of bodies mutually attract one another at near distances, and cohere, if contiguous; and electric bodies operate to greater distances, as well repelling as attracting the neighbouring corpuscles; and light is emitted, reflected, refracted, inflected, and heats bodies; and all sensation is excited, and the members of animal bodies move at the command of the will, namely, by the vibrations of this Spirit, mutually propagated along the solid filaments of the nerves, from the outward organs of sense to the brain, and from the brain into the muscles. But these are things that cannot be explained in few words, nor are we furnished with that sufficiency of experiments which is required to an accurate determination and demonstration of the laws by which this electric and elastic Spirit operates. 

 Dr. Pocock derives the Latin word Deus from the Arabic du (in the oblique case di), which signifies Lord. And in this sense princes are called gods, Psal. lxxxii. ver. 6; and John x. ver. 35. And Moses is called a god to his brother Aaron, and a god to Pharaoh (Exod. iv. ver. 16; and vii. ver. 1). And in the same sense the souls of dead princes were formerly, by the Heathens, called gods, but falsely, because of their want of dominion.
 This was the opinion of the Ancients. So Pythagoras, in Cicer. de Nat. Deor. lib. i Thales, Anaxagoros, Virgil, Georg. lib. iv. ver. 220; and Æneid, lib. vi. ver. 721. Philo Allegor, at the beginning of lib. i. Aratus, in his Phænom. at the beginning. So also the sacred writers; as St. Paul, Acts, xvii. ver 27, 28. St. John's Gosp. chap. xiv. ver. 2. Moses. in Deut. iv. ver. 39; and x ver. 14. David, Psal. cxxxix. ver. 7, 8, 9. Solomon, 1 Kings, viii. ver. 27. Job, xxii. ver. 12, 13, 14. Jeremiah, xxiii. ver. 23, 24. The Idolaters opposed the sun, moon, and stars, the souls of men, and other parts of the world, to be parts of the Supreme God, and therefore to be worshipped; but erroneously.
