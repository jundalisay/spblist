Book 1 laid down the principles of mathematical philosophy. This will be the basis of our reasonings on philosophical inquiries.

These mathematical principles are the laws and conditions of certain motions and forces. I use them to build a system of the universe.

To prevent them from being dry and barren, I have illustrated them here with some philosophical scholiums, such as:
- the density and the resistance of bodies
- spaces void of all bodies and
- the motion of light and sounds. 

I explain the principles as propositions. Readers should go through Books 1 and 2 first, specifically:
- the definitions
- laws of motion
- sections 1-3 of Book 1



## Rules Of Reasoning

### Rule 1: We only need to look for the causes of natural phenomena that are enough to explain their appearances.  

Nature is pleased with simpicity.

### Rule 2: The same natural effects come from the same natural causes

- Respiration is the same for humans and animals
- The light of our stove fire is the same as the light of the sun 




### Rule 3(!*): Universal qualities are those which are common to all the bodies which we experiment with 

The qualities of bodies are only known to us by experiments. We deem universal all those qualities that universally agree with experiments. <!--  nnd such as are not liable to diminution can never be quite taken away. -->

We will not relinquish the evidence of experiments for the sake of vain fictions. <!--  of our own devising nor are we to recede from
the analogy of Nature, which uses to be simple, and always consonant to
;
itself. -->

We can only know bodies by our senses.

and vis inertia of the whole, result from the extension, hardness,
impenetrability, mobility, and vires inertia of the parts; and thence we

conclude the least particles of all bodies to be also all extended, and hard
and impenetrable, and moveable, and endowed with their proper vires inertia.
And this is the foundation of all philosophy. Moreover, that the divided
but contiguous particles of bodies may be separated from one another, is
matter of observation and, in the particles that remain undivided, our
minds are able to distinguish yet lesser parts, as is mathematically demon

other, we cannot certainly determine.
Yet, had we the proof of but one
experiment that any undivided particle, in breaking a hard and solid body,
suffered a division, we might by virtue of this rule conclude that the un
divided as well as the divided particles may be divided and actually sep

arated to infinity.
Lastly, if it universally appears, by experiments and astronomical obser
vations, that all bodies about the earth gravitate towards the earth, and
that in proportion to the quantity of matter which they severally contain
that the moon likewise, according to the quantity of its matter, gravitates
towards the earth that, on the other hand, our sea gravitates towards the

This is immutable.

Their gravity is diminished as they recede from the earth. -->


<!-- In the preceding Books I have laid down the principles of philosophy, principles not philosophical, but mathematical: such, to wit, as we may build our reasonings upon in philosophical inquiries. These principles are the laws and conditions of certain motions, and powers or forces, which chiefly have respect to philosophy: but, lest they should have appeared of themselves dry and barren, I have illustrated them here and there with some philosophical scholiums, giving an account of such things as are of more general nature, and which philosophy seems chiefly to be founded on; such as the density and the resistance of bodies, spaces void of all bodies, and the motion of light and sounds. It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World. Upon this subject I had, indeed, composed the third Book in a popular method, that it might be read by many; but afterward, considering that such as had not sufficiently entered into the principles could not easily discern the strength of the consequences, nor lay aside the prejudices to which they had been many years accustomed, therefore, to prevent the disputes which might be raised upon such accounts, I chose to reduce the substance of this Book into the form of Propositions (in the mathematical way), which should be read by those only who had first made themselves masters of the principles established in the preceding Books: not that I would advise any one to the previous study of every Proposition of those Books; for they abound with such as might cost too much time, even to readers of good mathematical learning. It is enough if one carefully reads the Definitions, the Laws of Motion, and the first three Sections of the first Book. He may then pass on to this Book, and consult such of the remaining Propositions of the first two Books, as the references in this, and his occasions, shall require. -->

### Rule 4*: Induction from Phenomena over Imaginary Hypothesis

Our experiments<!--  philosophy -->, must be based on propositions collected by general induction from phenomena as accurately or very nearly true, despite any contrary imaginary hypotheses, until these are corrected by <!--  till such time as --> other phenomena. <!--  occur, by which they may either be made more accurate, or liable to exceptions. --> <!-- This rule we must follow, that --> The argument of induction cannot evaded by hypotheses.



{{< n n="Superhysics Note: Superphysics improves Physics-inductions by getting the general inductions from the feelings noted throughout history which may have escaped most people who have a limited view. These are then put into experiments to create new principles. We use data science instead of math to improve the quality of inductions, as well as aid in the expriments, since the brain can only process a limited data set" >}}
