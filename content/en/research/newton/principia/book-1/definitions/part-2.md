I classify time, space, place, and motion as:
- absolute and relative
- true and apparent
- mathematical and common.


## 1. Time

Absolute, true, and mathematical time flow equably without regard to anything external. It is also called duration. 

Relative, apparent, and common time, is a sensible and external measure of duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used. Examples are= an hour, a day, a month, a year.


## 2. Space

Absolute space has no regard to anything external. It remains always similar and immovable. 

Relative space is some movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces which our senses determine by its position to bodies and which is vulgarly taken for immovable space. Examples are= subterraneous, an aereal, or celestial space, all relative to the Earth. 

Absolute and relative space are the same in figure and magnitude. But they do not remain always numerically the same. 

For example, if the earth's atmosphere-space is increased vertically then the relative atmosphere-space will increase, but the absolute space will be the same. 


## 3. Place 

Place is a part of space which a body takes up. It is either absolute or relative depending on the space. 

<!-- I say, a part of space not the situation, nor the external surface of the body. For  -->

The places of equal solids are always equal, but their areas are often unequal.

Positions have no quantity and are properties of place.

The place of the whole motion is the sum of all the places of its parts. This is why place is internal and in the whole body. 


## 4. Motion 

Absolute motion is the translation of a body from one absolute place to another. 

Relative motion is the translation of a body from one relative place to another. 

The relative place of a moving ship is the current place of that ship which it has. 
- Its place of relative rest is that current place being continued

Real, absolute rest is the body being in the same part of that immovable space. 

If the earth does not move, then the ship, and its contents will also be moving as the ship is moving.  

But since the earth moves, then the contents of the ship will move partly from the absolute motion of the earth, and partly from the relative motion of the ship. 

The Earth moves to the East at a velocity of 10,010 parts. The ship goes  west, with a velocity of 10 parts. A sailor walks in the ship towards the east with 1 part velocity
- He will truly move East in the absolute space of the Earth with a velocity of 10001 parts
- He will relatively move towards the west, with a velocity of 9 parts


### Absolute Time


Absolute time, in astronomy, is distinguished from relative, by the correction of the apparent time. The natural days are absolutely unequal even if they are considered as equal and used to measure time. 

There is no such thing as an equable motion to be the basis of time. This is because all motions may be accelerated and retarded. But the flowing of absolute time does not change. 

The timespans of things remain the same whether they be fast, slow, or not moving [to an observer]. 

Therefore, this timespan should be distinguished from what measure by astronomical equation. This can be derived from:
- pendulum clock 
- eclipses of Jupiter's moons.


### Fixed Static Time and Space

The temporal order of time, and the spatial order of space, are immutable. 

If space moved, then it would move out of itself. Time and space are the places of themselves, as of all other things. 

All things are placed:
- in time as to order of succession
- in space as to order of location.

Space and time are places from their essence or nature. 

It is absurd for the primary places of things to be movable. 
- These are therefore the absolute places.
- The translations out of those places, are the only absolute motions.


The parts of space cannot be seen nor distinguished from one another by our senses. We judge them by using sensible measures of them. 

We define places based on immovable bodies. From there, we estimate all motions, considering bodies as transferred from place to place. 

And so, instead of absolute places and motions, we use relative ones.
