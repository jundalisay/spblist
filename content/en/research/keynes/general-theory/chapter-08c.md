Employment is a function of the expected consumption and the expected investment.

Consumption is, ceteris paribus, a function of net income, i.e. of net investment.

```bash
Net income = Consumption + Net investment 
```

An investment that withholds its actual spending <!-- before reckoning net income --> is less favourable to consumption, and therefore to employment.

<!-- The larger the financial provision which it is thought necessary to make , the , will a given level of investment prove to be.  -->

<!-- When the whole of this financial provision (or supplementary cost) is in fact currently expended in the upkeep of the already existing capital equipment, this point is not likely to be overlooked.  -->

<!-- But when the financial provision exceeds the actual expenditure on current upkeep, the practical results of this in its effect on employment are not always appreciated. For the amount of this excess neither directly gives rise to current investment nor is available to pay for consumption. 

It has, therefore, to be balanced by new investment, 

the demand for which has arisen quite independently of the current wastage of old equipment against which the financial provision is being made; with the result that the new investment available to provide current income is correspondingly diminished and a more intense demand for new investment is necessary to make possible a given level of employment. 

Moreover, much the same considerations apply to the allowance for wastage included in user cost, in so far as the wastage is not actually made good.  -->

An example is a house which continues to be habitable until it is demolished. 

<!-- If a certain sum is written off its value out of the -->

Let us assume that:
- an annual rent is paid by the tenants. 
- the landlord does not spend this money 

This money is a drag on employment throughout the life of the house. 
- This money suddenly becomes usable in a lump sum when the house has to be rebuilt. 

<!--  neither spends on upkeep nor regards as net income available for consumption, this provision, whether it is a part of U or of V, constitutes a  -->

In a stationary economy, all this might not be worth mentioning.
- This is because in each year, the depreciation of old houses would be exactly offset by the new houses built to replace those reaching the end of their lives in that year.

But such factors might be serious in a dynamic economy, especially after a lively burst of investment in long-term capital. 
- In such cases, a large amount of investment money is set aside to eventually be used to replace capital equipment.
- Incomes cannot increase until such money is spent. 
<!--  may be absorbed by the larger financial provisions made by entrepreneurs in respect of existing , upon the repairs and renewal of which, though it is wearing out with time, the date has not yet arrived for spending anything approaching the full financial provision which is being set aside;  -->

<!-- with the result that incomes cannot rise above a level which is low enough to correspond with a low aggregate of net investment.  -->

Thus sinking funds, etc. are provisions to pay for anticipated replacements. 
- These tend to withdraw spending power from the consumer long before the actual replacements are done. 
- They diminish the current effective demand
- They only increase it in the year in which the replacement is actually made. 

If the effect of this is aggravated by “financial prudence” then the cumulative result may be very serious.

Financial prudence here is the “writing off” of the initial cost more rapidly than the equipment actually wears out,  

For example, in the US in 1929, the rapid capital expansion of the previous 5 years had led cumulatively to the setting up of sinking funds and depreciation allowances on so huge a scale.
- It required an enormous volume of entirely new investment merely to absorb these financial provisions.
<!-- , in respect of plant which did not need replacement,  -->

It became almost hopeless to find still more new investment on a sufficient scale to provide for such new saving as a wealthy community in full employment would be disposed to set aside. 

**This factor alone was probably sufficient to cause a slump.** *

{{< n n="Generally overcapacity is not enough to cause a slump. It is when the investors demand a high rate of return for the capital that causes the slump" >}}

“Financial prudence” of this kind was continued to be exercised throughout the slump by those great corporations which were still in a position to afford it, it offered a serious obstacle to early recovery. 

In Great Britain at the present time (1935), the substantial amount of house-building and of other new investments since the war has led to an amount of sinking funds being set up much in excess of any present requirements for expenditure on repairs and renewals.

This tendency which has been accentuated, where the investment has been made by local authorities and public boards, by the principles of “sound” finance which often require sinking funds sufficient to write off the initial cost some time before replacement will actually fall due. 

This results that even if private individuals were ready to spend the whole of their net incomes it would be a severe task to restore full employment in the face of this heavy volume of statutory provision by public and semi-public authorities, entirely associated from any corresponding new investment. 

The sinking funds of local authorities now stand [4] at an annual figure of more than half the amount which these authorities are spending on the whole of their new developments.[5]

The Ministry of Health is not aware how much they may be aggravating unemployment when they insist on stiff sinking funds by local authorities.
