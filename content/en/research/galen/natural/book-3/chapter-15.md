Only a very little nutrient matter gets from the stomach into the arteries.

This is because these first become filled with lighter matter. 

There are 2 kinds of attraction that refills a vacuum:

 <!-- becomes refilled and that caused by appropriateness of quality;392  -->

1. Air Pressure
2. Magnetism

<!-- air is drawn into bellows in one way, and iron by the lodestone in another.  -->

<!-- The traction which results from evacuation acts primarily on what is light, whilst that from appropriateness of quality acts frequently, it may be, on what is heavier (if this should be naturally more nearly related393).  -->

The heart and the arteries are hollow organs capable of diastole.

They always attract the lighter matter first.

Their nourishment is actually into their coats.

 <!-- (which are the real bodies of these organs) that the appropriate matter is drawn.394  -->

Of the blood, then, which is taken into their cavities when they dilate, that part which is most proper to them and most able to afford nourishment is attracted by their actual coats.

<!-- Now, apart from what has been said,395  -->

The following is proof that something is taken over from the veins into the arteries.

Kill an animal by cutting a number of its large arteries.

The veins will become empty along with the arteries.

This could never occur if there were not anastomoses between them. 

Similarly, in the heart itself, the thinnest portion of the blood is drawn from the right ventricle into the left, owing to the perforations in the septum between them.
- These can be seen for a great part [of their length].
- They are like a kind of fossae [pits] with wide mouths.
- They get constantly narrower.

But it is not possible to observe their extreme terminations due to:
- the smallness of these and
- the fact that when the animal is dead all the parts are chilled and shrunken.396 

<!-- Here, too, however, our argument,397 starting from  -->

The principle is that nothing is done by Nature in vain. This manifests in the following ways:

1. The anastomoses between the ventricles of the heart

These could not be at random and by chance that there occurred fossae ending thus in narrow terminations.

2. The orifice of the right ventricle that gets blood in is much larger than the one that lets blood go out.

<!-- And secondly [the presence of these anastomoses has been assumed] from the fact that, 

of the two orifices in the right , the one conducting blood in and the other out, the former398 is much the larger.  -->

<!-- For, the fact that the insertion of the vena cava into the heart399 is larger than the vein which is inserted into the lungs400  -->

This suggests that not all the blood which the vena cava gives to the heart is driven away again from the heart to the lungs.*

{{< n n="This is because the blood is converted into animal spirits by the heart. These spirits do not need a large physical tube. They can move with smaller tubes but at greater speed. This is similar to a bullet train occuping 1 lane but transports as much as a large highway that is always full of cars" >}}

<!-- Nor can it be said that any of the blood is expended in the nourishment of the actual body of the heart, since there is another vein401 which breaks up in it and which does not take its origin nor get its share of blood from the heart itself.  -->

Even if a certain amount is so expended, still the vein leading to the lungs does not become smaller than that inserted into the heart as to make it likely that the blood is used as nutriment for the heart.

The disparity is much too great for such an explanation.

Therefore, something is taken over into the left ventricle.402

Moreover, of the two vessels connected with it, that which brings pneuma into it from the lungs403 is much smaller than the great outgrowing artery404 from which the arteries all over the body originate.

This suggests that it not merely gets pneuma from the lungs, but that it also gets blood from the right ventricle through the anastomoses mentioned.

The treatise “On the Use of Parts” shows that:
- some parts of the body is nourished by pure, thin, and vaporous blood
- other parts are nourished by thick, turbid blood
- Nature has overlooked nothing in this.

There are 2 kinds of attraction:

1. Some bodies exert attraction along wide channels during diastole.

This is by the principle by which a vacuum becomes refilled.

This can attract even from a distance.*

{{< n n="This is gravitation facilitated by the 2nd Element" >}}

2. Other bodies exert it by their appropriateness of quality

This can attract only in short-range. 

{{< n n="This is magnetism facilitated by virtual photons" >}}

 <!-- while the latter can only do so from among things which are quite close to them;  -->

The very longest tube let down into water can easily draw up the liquid into the mouth.

But if you go away from the lodestone, or corn from the jar, no further attraction can take place.

<!-- (an instance of this kind has in fact been already given405) -->

This can be observed most clearly in garden conduits.

These have a moisture distributed into every part lying close by.
- But it cannot reach those lying further off.

Therefore one has to arrange the flow of water into all parts of the garden by cutting a number of small channels leading from the large one.

The intervening spaces between these small channels have a size that best allows these spaces to satisfy their needs by drawing from the liquid which flows to them from every side.

So also is it in the bodies of animals.

Numerous conduits distributed through the various limbs bring them pure blood, much like the garden water-supply.

The intervals between these conduits have been wonderfully arranged by Nature from the outset so that the intervening parts will:
- be plentifully provided for when absorbing blood
- never be deluged by superfluous fluid running in at unsuitable times.

<!-- For the way in which they obtain nourishment is somewhat as follows.  -->

<!-- In the body406 which is -->

Erasistratus supposes his simple nerve vessel to be continuous throughout the body.

Its superficial parts first use of the nutriment that they get in contact with.

The parts coming next draw their share from these by their contiguity.

The deepers parts then draw from these. 

This does not stop until the quality of the nutrient substance has been distributed among all parts of the corpuscle in question.

For such parts as need the humour which is destined to nourish them to be altered still further.

Nature has provided a kind of storehouse, either in the form of:
- a central cavity or
- separate caverns 

<!-- 407 or something analogous to caverns.  -->

Thus the flesh of the viscera and of the muscles is nourished from the blood directly, this having undergone merely a slight alteration.

The bones, however, in order to be nourished, require very great change.

What blood is to flesh, marrow is to bone.

The small bones do not have central cavities. This marrow is distributed in their caverns. 

Whereas in the larger bones which do contain central cavities, the marrow is all concentrated in these.

<!-- For, as was pointed out in the first book,408  -->

Things having a similar substance can easily change into one another (Book 1). 

But it is impossible for those which are very different to be assimilated to one another without intermediate stages. 

- In cartilage, this is the myxoid substance which surrounds it.
- In ligaments, membranes, and nerves, this is the viscous liquid dispersed inside them.

Each of these consists of numerous fibres, which are homogeneous409—in fact, actual sensible elements.

In the intervals between these fibres is dispersed the humour most suited for nutrition.

They get this nutrition from the blood in the veins, choosing the most appropriate possible. They assimilate it step by step, changing it into their own substance.

All these considerations agree with one another.

 <!-- and bear sufficient witness to the truth of what has been already demonstrated; there is thus no need to prolong the discussion further. -->

<!-- For, from what has been said, anyone can readily discover in what way all the particular [vital activities] come about.  -->

For instance, this is why, in those who drink a lot of wine, the wine is rapidly absorbed410 through the body into the kidneys within a very short time. 

The speed of fluid absorption depends on:
- appropriateness of quality
- the thinness of the fluid
- the width of the vessels and their mouths
- the efficiency of the attractive faculty

The parts near the alimentary canal draw in the imbibed food for their own purposes by virtue of their appropriateness of quality.

Then the parts next to them in their turn snatch it away.

Then those next again take it from these, until it reaches the vena cava. 

Finally, the kidneys attract that part of it which is proper to them. 

This is why wine is taken up more rapidly than water due to its appropriateness of quality.
- Clear white wine is absorbed more rapidly due to its thinness.
- Black turbid wine is retarded on the way because of its thickness.

These facts will afford abundant proof of what has already been said about the arteries.

Everywhere, such blood as is both specifically appropriate and at the same time thin in consistency answers more readily to their traction than does blood which is not so.

This is why the arteries which, in their diastole, absorb vapour, pneuma, and thin blood attract either none at all or very little of the juices contained in the stomach and intestines.

301 For these terms (prosthesis and prosphysis in Greek) cf. p. 39, notes 5 and 6.

302 Lit. “through the energizing (or functioning) of the attractive faculty”; the faculty (δύναμις) in operation is an activity (ἐνέργεια). cf. p. 3, note 2.

303 This chapter is an excellent example of Galen’s method of reasoning a priori. The complementary inductive method, however, is employed in the next chapter. cf. p. 209, note 1.

304 The deductive.

305 The logos is the argument or “theory” arrived at by the process of λογικὴ θεωρία or “theorizing”; cf. p. 151, note 3; p. 205, note 1.

306 The Greek words for the uterus (mêtrae and hysterae) probably owe their plural form to the belief that the organ was bicornuate in the human, as it is in some of the lower species.

307 Note this expression. For Galen’s views on the origin of species, cf. Introduction, p. xxxi., footnote.

308 Herophilus of Chalcedon (circa 300 B.C.) was, like Erasistratus, a representative of the anatomical school of Alexandria. His book on Midwifery was known for centuries. cf. Introduction, p. xii.

309 Relaxation of utero-sacral ligaments as an important predisposing cause of prolapsus uteri.

310 That is, at the end of the first stage of labour.

311 The pylorus.

312 “Chylosis,” chylification. cf. p. 240, note 1.

313 Lit. barley-“chyle,” i.e. barley-water.

314 i.e. not the mere mechanical breaking down of food, but a distinctively vital action of “alteration.”

315 Pepsis.

316 Book I., chaps. x., xi.

317 cf. p. 222, note 1.

318 Choledochous.

319 More exactly peristolé; cf. p. 97, note 1.

320 Neuburger says of Erasistratus that “dissection had taught him to think in terms of anatomy.” It was chiefly the gross movements or structure of organs with which he concerned himself. Where an organ had no obvious function, he dubbed it “useless”; e.g. the spleen (cf. p. 143).

321 i.e. contracting and dilating; no longitudinal movements involved; cf. p. 263, note 2.

322 cf. p. 282, note 1.

323 Book II., chaps. ii. and viii.

324 Note use of psychological terms in biology. cf. also p. 133, note 3.

325 “In everything.” cf. p. 66, note 3.

326 Galen confuses the nutrition of organs with that of the ultimate living elements or cells; the stomach does not, of course, feed itself in the way a cell does. cf. Introduction, p. xxxii.

327 cf. Asclepiades’s theory regarding the urine, p. 51.

328 The process of application or prosthesis. cf. p. 223, note 3.

329 Mutual influence of organism and environment.

330 Qualitative change. cf. Book I., chap. ii.

331 Apparently skin-diseases in which a superficial crust (resembling the lichen on a tree-trunk) forms—e.g. psoriasis.

332 Note especially pneuma and innate heat, which practically stand for oxygen and the heat generated in oxidation. cf. p. 41, note 3.

333 Book I., chap. x.

334 That is to say, faeces are obviously altered food. This alteration cannot have taken place entirely in the small intestine: therefore alteration of food must take place in the stomach.

335 cf. p. 39.

336 Asclepiades held that there was no such thing as real qualitative change; the food was merely broken up into its constituent molecules, and absorbed unaltered. cf. p. 49, note 5.

337 i.e. denial of forethought in the Physis.

338 v. p. 9, et passim.

339 cf. p. 97.

340 It appears to me, from comparison between this and other passages in Galen’s writings (notably Use of Parts, iv., 8), that he means by the “two coats” simply the mucous and the muscular coats. In this case the “straight” or “longitudinal” fibres of the inner coat would be the rugae; the “circular” fibres of the inner intestinal coat would be the valvulae conniventes.

341 The term here rendered peristalsis is peristolé in Greek; it is applied only to the intermittent movements of muscles placed circularly round a lumen or cavity, and comprehends systolé or contraction and diastolé or dilatation. In its modern significance, peristalsis, however, also includes the movements of longitudinal fibres. cf. p. 97, note 1.

342 i.e. those containing non-striped or “involuntary” muscle fibres; organs governed by the “natural” pneuma; cf. p. 186, note 3.

343 By this term is meant only what we should call the “voluntary” muscles.

344 cf. p. 97.

345 For “symptom,” cf. p. 13, and p. 12, note 3. “Transitum namque materiae per angustum corpus id accidens consequitur” (Linacre). Less a “result” or “consequence” than an “accompaniment.”

346 i.e. this is a purely mechanical process.

347 i.e.. this phenomenon is a proof neither of peristolé nor of attraction. cf. p. 97, note 2.

348 Contraction and dilatation of course being reversed.

349 The channa is a kind of sea-perch; “a species of Serranus, either S. scriba or S. cabrilla” (D’Arcy W. Thompson). cf. Aristotle’s Nat. Hist. (D’Arcy Thompson’s edition, Oxford, 1910), IV., xi., 538 A, 20. The synodont “is not to be identified with certainty, but is supposed to be Dentex vulgaris,” that is, an edible Mediterranean perch. “It is not the stomach,” adds Prof. Thompson, “but the air-bladder that gets everted and hangs out of the mouth in fishes, especially when they are hauled in from a considerable depth.” cf. H. A., VIII., ii., 591 B, 5.

350 Under the term “neura,” tendons were often included as well as nerves. Similarly in modern Dutch the word zenuw (“sinew”) means both a tendon and a nerve; zenuwachtig = “nervous.”

351 Rather than the alternative reading, τὸν ἔσωθεν χιτῶνα. Galen apparently supposes that the outer coat will not be damaged, as the cuts will pass between its fibres. These cuts would be, presumably, short ones, at various levels, no single one of them involving the whole circumference of the gullet.

352 cf. p. 205.

353 Thus Galen elsewhere calls the spleen a mere emunctory (ἐκμαγεῖον) of the liver. cf. p. 214, note 1.

354 cf. p. 269.

355 The urinary bladders of pigs (such as Galen dissected) are thin, and appear to have only one coat.

356 cf. p. 243.

357 My suggestion is that Galen refers to (1) the mucous coat, with its valvulae conniventes, and (2) the muscular coat, of which the chief layer is made up of circular fibres. cf. p. 262, note 1.

358 Or utility.

359 Relationship between physiology and pathology again emphasized. cf. p. 188, note 2.

360 Or physicist—the investigator of the Physis or Nature. cf. p. 196, note 2. Note here the use of analogical reasoning. cf. p. 113, note 2.

361 cf. p. 95.

362 I. xiii.; II. ii.

363 Galen’s idea is that if reversal of the direction of flow can occur in the primae viae (in vomiting), it may also be expected to occur in the secundae viae or absorptive channels.

364 For this “delivery,” “up-yield,” or anadosis, v. p. 13, note 5.

365 The mesenteric veins.

366 Linacre renders: “Una omnium confluxio ac conspiratio”; and he adds the marginal note “Totum corpus nostrum est conspirabile et confluxile per meatus communes.” cf. p. 48.

367 The alimentary canal, as not being edible, is not considered a splanchnon or viscus.

368 Lit. rheums; hence our term rheumatism.

369 Here Galen apparently indicates that vital functions are at least partly explicable in terms of mechanical law. cf. Introduction, p. xxviii.

370 cf. pp. 211, 247.

371 See p. 298, note 1.

372 The ends of the veins in the alimentary canal from which absorption or anadosis had originally taken place.

373 Diathesis.

374 Diathesis.

375 Pathos.

376 He means, not only under the stress of special circumstances, but also normally.

377 Lit. “rough artery.” The air-passages as well as the arteries proper were supposed by the Greeks to carry air (pneuma); diastole of arteries was, like expansion of the chest, a movement for drawing in air. cf. p. 317, note 1.

378 cf. p. 39, chap. xi.

379 Lit. orexis.

380 Lit. a “physical” organ; that is, a mere instrument or organon of the Physis,—not one of the Psyche or conscious personality. cf. semen, p. 132, note 1.

381 cf. p. 317, note 2; p. 319, chap. xv.

382 Note that absorption takes place from the stomach as well as the intestines. cf. p. 118, note 1.

383 That is, among the ultimate tissues or cells.

384 Pp. 205-9.

385 By this term, of course, the air-passages are also meant; cf. p. 305.

386 cf. p. 34, note 1.

387 cf. p. 121, note 4.

388 Pulmonary vein, or rather, left auricle. Galen means a reflux through the mitral orifice; the left auricle was looked on rather as the termination of the pulmonary veins than as a part of the heart. cf. p. 323, note 4. He speaks here of a kind of “physiological” mitral incompetence.

389 Horror vacui.

390 cf. p. 305, note 2.

391 cf. p. 308, note 1.

392 The “mechanical” principle of horror vacui contrasted with the “physical” or semi-physiological principle of specific attraction. Appropriateness here might almost be rendered affinity or kinship. cf. note 2, infra.

393 “Related,” “akin.” cf. p. 36, note 2.

394 The coats exercise the vital traction, the cavities the merely mechanical. cf. p. 165, note 2.

395 Chap. xiv.

396 These fossae were probably the recesses between the columnae carnae.

397 On logos cf. p. 226, note 2.

398 He means the tricuspid orifice. cf. p. 121, note 4.

399 The right auricle was looked on less as a part of the heart than as an expansion or “insertion” of the vena cava.

400 This “vein” (really the pulmonary artery) was supposed to be the channel by which the lungs received nutriment from the right heart. cf. p. 121, note 3.

401 The coronary vein.

402 Galen’s conclusion, of course, is, so far, correct, but he has substituted an imaginary direct communication between the ventricles for the actual and more roundabout pulmonary circulation, of whose existence he apparently had no idea. His views were eventually corrected by the Renascence anatomists. cf. Introduction, pp. xxii.-xxiii.

403 He means the left auricle, considered as the termination of the pulmonary “arteries”; cf. p. 314, note 3.

404 The aorta, its orifice being circular, appears bigger than the slit-like mitral orifice.

405 p. 87.

406 Or we may render it “corpuscle”; Galen practically means the cell. cf. p. 153, note 2.

407 cf. the term “cavernous tissue.”

408 I. x.

409 Lit. homoeomerous, i.e. “the same all through,” of similar structure throughout, the elements of living matter, cf. p. 20, note 3, and cf. also the “cell” of Erasistratus, p. 153.

410 “Delivered,” “dispersed”; cf. p. 13, note 5.
