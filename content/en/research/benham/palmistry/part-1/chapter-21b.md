<!-- ## Part 2  -->

From every point of view the Apollonian is brilliant, full of the love of beauty, art, color, and form. 

The Mount, from its brilliancy, has also been called the Mount of the Sun, and the Line of Apollo, when strongly marked in the hand, has been called the Line of the Sun, or of Brilliancy, and to it has been ascribed a fortunate career, with wealth and fame as the reward. 

As this line shows the strength of development of the Apollonian qualities in a subject, making the Mount stronger, thus the type also, it is not unreasonable that wealth and fame should be secured by so brilliant a subject as is the Apollonian.

The Apollonian is highly intuitive. 

He sees through things more quickly than other people and especially is this perceptive faculty strong in art and literature. 

He does not labor to learn, as does his companion, the Saturnian, neither is he as profound and deep. 

But the Apollonian, no matter how little he may really know, will make a brilliant show of it, and in any company, from the seeming depth of his knowledge and research, is a surprise. This arises from the wonderful versatility of his nature, and the quick way he has of grasping a small idea and making a great deal out of it. He is inventive as well as an imitator, and can put old things in new ways. 

Thus he often gets credit for knowing a great deal more than he really does. He is always the centre of attraction in whatever company he may be found, and will adapt himself to circumstances and people. He can be thrown with scientists and will cope with them in whatever field of research they are working. 

He will, with equal facility and without thought or preparation, join a body of socialists, artists, anarchists, doctors, lawyers, or any profession or class, and will astonish those present with his seeming mastery of the particular subject. His adaptability and versatility are astonishing, and "brilliant" is the only word that fitly describes him. He fairly sparkles with intuition, and seems to learn without study.

This makes him sought by all classes of people. He is the life of the drawing-room, the hero of the athletic field, the daring and successful plunger either in the stock market or at the gaming table. In any and all walks of life he is found, full of dash, brilliancy, versatility. For him the beautiful in nature, women, home decorations, and dress, have always a fascination. Anything that lacks beauty is repulsive.

With this strong passion in him he is the artist always and in everything. He may not be the great painter, but if he have short nails, surely he is the critic. He adores art in every form, and owing to his versatility, he is always a dabbler in it. He loves fine clothes, luxurious home surroundings, and jewels. 

If he is the refined type with first phalanx the longest, he will have excellent taste in all these. If he belongs to the class who have the world of the third phalanx longest, he will be loud and shoddy in displaying his love of such matters. He is a good fellow. Health is good with him, so he feels kindly toward mankind, especially as he manages to cope with them so easily. He is a warm friend, but being somewhat changeable is not always constant. 

Being brilliant, he makes enemies among those less so than himself, and these enemies often become bitter and envious rivals. His brain is clear, and in all matters of business, religion, art, or literature he sees things from a logical point of view. He has a great facility of expression, and while not always deep is easy to understand. 

To him success is natural, it comes by the very force of circumstance. Friends and the world like him and gladly do much to forward his interests, and he is thus pushed by his admirers into many advantageous enterprises. He attains high positions and is a great money-maker. He is never economical and does not rely on putting away a part of his earnings, but by brilliant and successful spurts forges ahead. 

His tastes are luxurious and his expenditures follow them, but he makes so much that the expenses seem little.

He is always figuring in the thousands, and looks down on single dollars.

The Apollonian is never afraid to air his views, or to speak his mind freely. He loves to hear himself talk.

He is religious in his instincts. He understands religion as he does every other subject and problem of the universe.

He is not a fanatic, nor superstitious, nor is he a doubter. He embraces religious faith eagerly.

He is proficient in occult sciences, and does some wonderful things. He cannot explain how, but knows it is not from deep study. It is in reality his highly intuitive faculties that make him proficient here. 

He is cheerful, happy, and bright. But he is subject to bursts of quick temper which are fierce while they last, it is only a momentary flash, and he holds no resentment.

He does not harbor grudges and has the ability to win over his worst enemy to at least a seeming friendship. He does not make lasting friends, but by his brilliancy temporarily attracts and enslaves.

He himself is not a lasting friend, consequently he does not inspire true friendship in others. As much as he loves pleasure and gayety he is neither amorous nor sensual, - that is, in the high type. He loves a banquet as much for the after-dinner wit, the music, the decorations, the beauty of dress, as for the viands which grace the table. 

He loves women who are beautiful, finely or tastefully dressed. Base passions do not inflame him.

He does not fall a prey to dissipation, though he will not refuse pleasure when it has the proper accompaniments. He is a great traveller and fond of seeing the world.

He is honest, and acknowledges his faults, fully appreciates his own brilliancy and does not deny it. 

He does not need to steal for he can make money too easily. 

He honestly desires celebrity and gains it. If he relied more on effort and less on brilliancy, he would reach fame more frequently and in greater degree. 

If he could chain his talents, his brilliancy of mind, body, and endowment, down to a definite line of work, he would dominate the world. 

As it is, he moves among us a brilliant possibility, a magnificent specimen physically and mentally, a joy, a pleasure, a benefit, but too often, through his versatility, a "Jack-of-all-trades." In his marriage relations the Apollonian is often unhappy. 


<!-- ## Part 3  -->

He is predisposed to marry. 

<!-- He does not, like the Saturnian, withdraw from and hate mankind, but  -->

His ideal is very high. He is brilliant himself and he wants a mate who can shine with him. 

Humanity is frail. Those most brilliant often choose much less-favored helpmates. 

When this is the case the Apollonian finds himself disappointed and his marriage a failure. With a large percentage of the type this is true and should be so treated in your readings.
