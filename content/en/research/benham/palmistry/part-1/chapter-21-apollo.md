The Apollonian is identified by the Mount and finger of Apollo.
- This is a good type. 

The Apollonian sometimes becomes mercenary and shoddy. 
- But he does not often become bad or criminal.
- Saturn and Mercury, the bilious types, become bad and vicious. 

Apollonians do not often descend to criminality. 
- When they do, it is the result of sudden emotions or circumstances, and not as a result of inherent badness. 

The following strenthen the Mount of Apollo as single signs, or in combination:
- star
- triangle
- circle
- single vertical line
- square
- trident

The cross-bar, grille, cross, island, or dot, show defects of the Mount, either of health or character. Nails, color, etc., will determine which (102). 

The normal Apollonian is healthy and vigorous. Consequently, he is happy, genial, and attractive. 

He is a spontaneous type, and versatility, brilliancy, love of the beautiful and artistic in everything, are his attributes. Standing alongside the Saturnian, he is the direct opposite of that gloomy fellow. 

The dark side of life is in the background with him and, as the Saturnian was needed as a check to over-enthusiasm, so the Apollonian is needed in order that darkness and gloom may not dominate. 

Play and diversion must follow work if we are to keep healthy and vigorous. Someone must provide these recreative things. We must have comedians, for laughter is atonic to the tired brain. 

<!-- , these rests from seriousness.  -->

- The Jupiterian is engrossed in his schemes for aggrandizement
- The Saturnian is absorbed in wisdom, sobriety, or gloom

Who shall provide the bright things which shall make life worth living? That task is the Apollonian's. 

This type has been completely misunderstood. 

It has always stood for art and brilliancy. It is tempting to ascribe to every hand which has a good Mount of Apollo great artistic talent, frequently far in excess of that really possessed by the subject. 

All Apollonians are not artists or actors, and never can be. 

All Apollonians love beauty in dress, home, business surroundings. <!-- , and every walk in life in which they are found. --> 

They enjoy life by the force of their spontaneous natures, and cause those around them to enjoy it. 

All things beautiful and artistic appeal to them. 

They might be producers or creators of art, but they always love it. 

There is a wide difference between a creative person and a mere lover of the beautiful. 

Do not ascribe great artistic talent to one who is merely fond of beauty in dress and surroundings. 

The creative Apollonian has:
- a finely developed Mount
- apex in the centre
- finger long
- first phalanx long
- a fine, deep-cut Line of Apollo (103), often with stars in it


<!-- With the above strong markings, he will have creative power and will not be merely a lover of the beautiful (104).  -->

The Apollonian <!-- has another side. He --> is also highly successful in business. He carries his love of beauty here as everywhere else. 

He is richly endowed with graces which draw people to him, and with his natural brilliancy and versatility he adapts himself to the conditions of the times, the demands of the public, chooses his goods with a tasteful eye, and makes money thereby. 

The business Apollonian has:
- a strongly marked high Mount
- apex in the centre, but not necessarily cut with deep lines. 
  - if there are any, you will find several vertical ones on the Mount, showing diversity of talent, but not the creative power of the artist.

Generally you find a secondary, Mercurian development to accentuate the business shrewdness. 

With the Apollonian, it is necessary, above all, to distinguish these 2 classes:

1. Those capable of creative power in art
2. Those who are mere lovers of the beautiful and tasteful things of life.

The Apollonian is a handsome and a manly type. 

- He is of medium height, between the Jupiterian and Saturnian.
- He is not fleshy like the Jupiterian nor lean and lanky like the Saturnian, but is shapely, muscular, and athletic.

<!-- The lines of the body run in graceful curves, and he is light and supple.  -->

- His complexion is clear, his skin white, fine and firm in texture, and cheeks rosy. This pinkness of color gives the clue to a healthy condition and consequent attractiveness. 
- The hair is thick, wavy, and black or auburn in color, fine and silky in quality. 
- If he has a beard, it has the same fineness and abundance, growing over the chin, lip, and high on the cheeks.
- His forehead is broad and full, but not high
- His eyes are large, almond-shaped, brown or blue in color, with long lashes curling up at the ends. The eyes have a frank, honest expression, which changes to sweetness and sympathy when the emotions are in play, and they sparkle with the brilliancy and life of the brain behind them.
- His cheeks are firm and rounded, showing no hollows.
- The nose is straight and finely shaped, the nostrils beautifully proportioned, and dilating sensitively under the play of emotions; as is the case with all highly strung organizations. 
- The mouth is graceful in outline, the lips curved and set evenly, neither thin nor large and thick. 
- The teeth are finely shaped, strong, even, and white, firmly set in healthy red gums.
- The chin is shapely and rounded, neither retreating nor protruding, showing evenly balanced firmness. 
- The ears are of medium size, well formed, and pink, setting close to the head.
- The neck is long, muscular, and well shaped, but showing neither cord-like muscles, nor a prominent "Adam's apple."  This shapely neck connects the well-shaped head with strong shoulders, which are muscular and graceful.
- The chest is full and capacious, expands well under the inspiration, which fact undoubtedly contributes much to purifying the blood, pink color with healthy conditions following. 
- The voice is musical, but not full or resonant. The lower limbs are graceful, muscular, finely proportioned, and are never fat. 
- The feet are of medium size, the insteps arching and high, which gives spring and elasticity to the walk. 

This is a particularly distinguishing feature of the Apollonian. 

In this type is a picture of healthy conditions, beautiful proportions, grace and symmetry of body, and to these must be linked a mind full of similar charms and attributes.
