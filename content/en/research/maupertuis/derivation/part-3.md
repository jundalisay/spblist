<!-- II. Need to Identify Proofs of God's Existence in the General Laws of Nature;  -->

## The Laws Governing Motion's Conservation, Distribution, and Destruction are Based on the Attributes of a Supreme Intelligence

We should not seek the supreme Being in little details.

<!--  in the parts of the universe of whose relationships we
know too little;  -->

Rather, we should seek Him in universal phenomena that allow no exception and whose simplicity is entirely exposed to our view.

<!-- Such research is more difficult than studying an insect, a flower, or similar things that Nature offers
to our eyes every moment. But we can be aided in our difficult march by a guide, one who is sure-footed
although he has not yet gone where we would like to go. -->

Until now, the goals of mathematics have rarely gone beyond coarse needs of the body and useless speculations of the spirit. 

The truths that it has uncovered are mostly those relating to dimensions and numbers. One should not be deceived by philosophical works that pretend to be mathematical, but are merely dubious and murky metaphysics. 

Just because a philosopher can recite the words lemma, theorem and corollary doesn't mean that his work has the certainty of mathematics. 

That certainty does not derive from big words, or even from the method used by geometers, but rather from the utter simiplicity of the objects considered by mathematics. Let us see whether we can find a better use for mathematics. 

Mathematical arguments for God's existence would have the obvious certainty characteristic of geometrical truths.

Those who doubt metaphysical reasoning would believe a mathematical argument more readily, whereas those exposed to the usual arguments would find mathematical arguments more elevating and precise.


Therefore, let us not stop at simple speculation about the marvels of Nature. 

The organization of animals, the precise and many parts of insects, the enormous sizes and distances and revolutions of astronomical bodies, such arguments are better suited to amaze our mind than to clarify it. The supreme Being is everywhere.

But He is not equally visible everywhere. 

<!-- Let us seek Him in the simplest things, in the most fundamental laws of
Nature, in the universal rules by which movement is conserved, distributed or destroyed; and let us not seek
Him in phenomena that are merely complex consequences of these laws. -->

I could have started from mathematical laws that are confirmed by experience, and tried to show how they reflect the wisdom and power of the supreme Being. But those laws can be uncertain since they are often not based on rigorous proofs or purely geometrical hypotheses.

So I deduce mathematical laws from the attributes of an all-powerful and all-wise Being. 

If those derived laws are actually found in the universe, then the proof that this Being exists (and created those laws) is more certain. 

But, one might object, what if the laws of motion and equilibrium are a necessary consequence of the nature of matter, and contain no arbitrariness? Wouldn't it be wrong to ascribe to Providence something that is absolutely necessary?

The laws of motion and equilibrium are indeed absolutely necessary consequences of the nature of matter, that proves all the more the perfection of the supreme Being. Everything is so arranged that the blind logic of mathematics executes the will of the most enlightened and free Mind.

Certain philosophers of antiquity held that movement does not exist.

An overly subtle use of their minds denied the evidence of their own senses. The difficulties they had in conceiving how a body could move, made them deny that bodies moved or even could move. 

Without delving into the arguments upon which they tried to base their opinion, we note that one cannot deny motion except by arguments that deny the reality of objects outside ourselves, arguments that reduce the universe to us, and all phenomena to our perceptions.


We know motion only through our senses; but how many things do we know otherwise? 

The motive force is the ability of a moving body to move other bodies. This is just terminology filling in for
understanding and has no meaning beyond the results of phenomena.

It is only mental habit that prevents us from realizing how miraculous it is that motion can be passed from one body to another. 

Once our eyes have opened, nothing is so striking. For those who have never thought about it, it doesn't sem mysterious.

By contrast, those who have meditated on it may despair of ever understanding it.

Imagine someone who had never touched a body and had never seen them collide, but who had some
experience with mixing colors, and let this person see a blue body moving towards a yellow body. If asked
about what would happen when the two bodies collided, he might say that the blue body would turn green when
it hit the yellow body. But would he guess that the two bodies would join together and move at a common
speed? or that one body would transfer part of its motion to the other so that it moves in the same direction at a
different speed? or that it would be reflected in the opposite direction? I don't think it would be possible to guess
these things.

We have experienced the impenetrability of a material body, we have proven to ourselves that a certain force is
required to change its motion, we have seen that the collision of two bodies causes them to stop or be reflected
or displace a resting body or, more generally, change their speed. Yet how do such changes occur? What is this
power that bodies seem to have to act on one another?

We observe that some particles of matter are in motion, while others are at rest. Hence, motion is not an essential property of matter; rather, it is a state in which matter may find itself â€” or not. We see only that
material bodies can extract motion from each other.

The material particles moving in Nature received their motion from an external cause that is unknown hitherto.
The particles are themselves indifferent to motion or rest; if at rest, they stay so, whereas moving bodies
continue to move until something changes their motion. When a moving particle of matter encounters another
particle at rest, it passes on some or all of its motion. Every collision of two bodies (whether one is at rest and
the other moves, or both are moving) is accompanied by a change in motion. The impact causes this change; it
would be absurd to say that a particle moves another particle, given that it can't even move itself.
To identify the original cause of motion, the greatest philosopher of antiquity resorted to a Prime Mover, itself
unmovable and indivisible. A modern philosopher has not only recognized God as the author of all motion of
material particles, but also argued that God's direct intervention is continually necessary for every change and
redistribution of motion. Not being able to understand how bodies can move other bodies, he denied that they
did and concluded that when bodies hit or press on other bodies, it is God who makes them move; their impact
is nothing but a prompting for God to move them.

These philosophers assign the cause of motion to God because they don't know where else to put it; they resort
to an immaterial Being, since they can't imagine that matter should have the power to produce, distribute and
destroy motion. But it's important to realize that all the laws of motion and equilibrium should be based on a
suitable principle, if we are to use them to prove God's existence, regardless of whether bodies can act directly
on each other, or whether they use some other interaction as yet poorly understood.

Derivation of the laws of motion and equilibrium from a metaphysical principle - Wikisource, the free online library
The simplest law of Nature is that of equilibrium, which has been known for many centuries; but until now, it
has seemed to have no connection to the laws of motion, which were much more difficult to discover.
Research into motion was not to the liking (or perhaps not within the scope) of the ancients, so that we may
consider it as a completely new science. How could the ancients have discovered the laws of moiton, given that
some philosophers reduced all their speculations about motion to sophistic disputes,whereas others denied that
motion existed at all?

More industrious and sensible philosophers judged only that it would be difficult to understand the principles of
motion, and invented reasons to despair of ever knowing them, as an excuse to get out of doing experiments.
A true philosopher does not engage in vain disputes about the nature of motion; rather, he wishes to know the
laws by which it is distributed, conserved or destroyed, knowing that such laws are the basis for all natural
philosophy.

The great Descartes, boldest of the philosophers, sought such laws, but was mistaken. 

However, time brought the subject of mechanics to a kind of maturity and those laws, unknown for centuries, were developed suddenly in several places at once. Huygens, Wallis and Wren discovered them at the same time. Many mathematicians
after them have confirmed these laws, although they arrived at these laws by different routes.

Nevertheless, although mathematicians agree today on the more complicated case, they do not agree on the
simpler case. Everyone agrees about the distribution of motion in the collision of perfectly elastic bodies, but
not in the collision of perfectly inelastic bodies; some even believe that the distribution of motion cannot be
calculated in the latter case. This embarassing failure has caused some to deny the existence and even the
possibility of perfectly inelastic bodies, claiming that bodies believed to perfectly inelastic are actually elastic
bodies whose hardness prevents us from seeing the deformation and recovery of its shape.


These people point to experiments on bodies commonly called "hard" and "undeformable" showing that these
bodies are actually deformable and elastic. For example, when spheres made of ivory, or maple wood, or glass
collide, they seem to have deformed during the collision, only to recover their shape immediately afterwards.
This may be seen by painting one of the spheres with a color that comes off and stains the other sphere; the size
of the stain after the collision shows that the spheres were flattened during the collision, although no trace of the
deformation remains afterwards.

These people then add metaphysical arguments to these arguments. They require that every process in Nature
take a certain time, and obey a law of continuity. They object that when a perfectly inelastic body collides with
an impassable barrier, its speed must go to zero instantly, without passing through any intermediate values; or its
speed instantly is transformed into its opposite, without passing through zero.

I don't feel the force of this argument. I don't think we know enough of the means by which
motion can be produced or destroyed to say whether it must follow the law of continuity. If you assume that
speed must change by degrees, doesn't it change discontinuously between degrees? Even imperceptible
discontinuous changes would violate the law of continuity as much as the sudden destruction of the universe.
The experiments suggest that it is easy to confuse hardness with elasticity, but they do not show that all hard
bodies are elastic. 

On the contrary, those who have considered the impenetrability of bodies suggest that perfect
inelasticity is a necessary consequence of matter. Most bodies are deformable because they are made up of particles that can move relative to each other when stress is applied; however, the fundamental particles, the
elements that make up all other bodies, these must be bodies that are perfectly inelastic, undeformable and
unchangeable.

The more one considers elasticity, the more it seems to require that the elastic body have parts that can move
relative to one another under stress.

Hence, it is more reasonable to assert that the fundamental particles of matter are perfectly hard, rather than
to pretend that perfectly hard bodies do not exist in Nature.

Nevertheless, I do not know whether our present knowledge allows us to make either assertion definitely. 

However, one of the main reasons for denying that perfectly hard bodies exist was that we were unable to derive the laws of motion transfer for hard bodies.

Descartes agreed that perfectly hard bodies exist, and believed to have discovered the laws of their motion. It
started from a principle that seems reasonable, namely, that total momentum is conserved in Nature.

Unfortunately, he derived false laws, because his initial principle, the conservation of total momentum, is not
true.

The philosophers who followed Descartes noted another conservation law: that of kinetic energy.

It is one-half times the mass times the speed squared.

These philosophers did not derive their laws of motion from this conservation law, but rather the reverse; they derived the conservation law from their laws of motion. However, since kinetic energy is conserved only for perfectly elastic bodies, that reinforced them in their belief that only elastic bodies exist in Nature.

Momentum is conserved only in special cases.

Kinetic energy is conserved only for certain types of bodies.

Neither one represents a universal principle, a general law of motion.

If one studies these principles and the reasoning their authors used, it is surprising that they ever were able to derive them.

One suspects that they worked backwards from experience, rather than deducing them from basic
principles. 

Those who argue most rigorously recognize that the principle used to derive the collision laws for
elastic bodies would not be applicable to perfectly inelastic bodies. Moreover, the laws of mechanical
equilibrium are independent of the conservation laws used to derive laws for collisions of elastic and inelastic
bodies.

After so many great men have worked on this subject, I almost do not dare to say that I have discovered the
universal principle upon which all these laws are based, a principle that covers both elastic and inelastic
collisions and describes the motion and equilibrium of all material bodies.

This is the principle of least action, a principle so wise and so worthy of the supreme Being, and intrinsic to all
natural phenomena.

One observes it at work:
- in every change. and 
- in every constancy that Nature exhibits. 

In the collision of bodies, motion is distributed such that the quantity of action is as small as possible,
given that the collision occurs. 

At equilibrium, the bodies are arranged such that, if they were to undergo a small movement, the quantity of action would be smallest.

The laws of motion and equilibrium derived from this principle are exactly those observed in Nature. 

We may admire the applications of this principle in all phenomena: the movement of animals, the growth of plants, the
revolutions of the planets, all are consequences of this principle. The spectacle of the universe seems all the
more grand and beautiful and worthy of its Author, when one considers that it is all derived from a small
number of laws laid down most wisely. Only thus can we gain a fitting idea of the power and wisdom of the supreme Being, not from some small part of creation for which we know neither the construction, usage nor its relationship to other parts. What satisfaction for the human spirit in contemplating these laws of motion and
equilibrium for all bodies in the universe, and in finding within them proof of the existence of Him who governs
the universe!
