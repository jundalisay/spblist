<!-- ### Problem 2: Laws of Motion for Elastic Bodies -->

Let there be two elastic bodies of masses `m1` and `m2` moving in the same direction with speeds `v1` and `v2`, respectively. 

`v1` is faster so that it overtakes the `m2` and collides with it.

Let `u1` and `u2` represent the speeds of the 2 bodies after the collision.

The sum or difference of these speeds is the same as that before the collision. 


`m1` was moving at speed `v1` and was covering a distance `v1` per unit time. The universe changed so that now `m1` moves at speed `u1` and covers a distance `u1` per unit time.

`m2` was moving at speed `v2` covering a distance `v2` per unit time. Now it moves at speed `u2` and covers a distance `u2` per unit time.

This change would be the same if:

- while `Body 1` was moving at speed `v1` and was covering a distance `v1` per unit time, it was being transported backwards by an invisible, massless plane moving at speed `v1 - u1` and covering a distance `v1 - u1` per unit time
- while `Body 2` was moving at speed `v2` and was covering a distance `v2` per unit time, it was being transported forwards by an invisible, massless plane moving at speed `u2 - v2`, covering a distance `u2 - v2` per unit time.

The motion of these immaterial planes conveying the masses `m1` and `m2` are the same, regardless of whether the masses are moving relative to these planes or are at rest.

Hence, the quantities of action produced in Nature are m1(v1 - u1)^2 and m2(u2 - v2)^2, the sum of which should be minimized. 

Thus, we have:

...

For elastic bodies, the relative speed after the impact should equal the relative speed before the impact.

Hence, we have u2 - u1 = v1 - v2, as u2 = u1 + v1 - v2 and, thus, dv2 = dv1.

Substitution into the preceding equation yields the final speeds:

...

and

...

When 2 bodies are moving towards each other, we make the second speed negative. In that case, the final speeds are:

...

and

...


If the second body is at rest before the impact, then `v2 = 0`, then the final speeds are:

...

and

...


If the first body encounters an impassable barrier, one can consider that barrier as a body of infinite mass at rest.


In that case, the final speed `u1 = -v1` i.e., the first mass rebounds at the same speed with which it struck the barrier.

If one takes the sum of the kinetic energies, one sees that they are the same after the impact as before; thus:

...

the sum of the kinetic energies is conserved after the impact. However, this conservation applied only to elastic bodies, and not to inelastic bodies.

The general principle that applies to both types of bodies is that the quantity of action required to cause a change in Nature is as small as possible.

This principle is so universal and so fruitful that one can also derive the law of mechanical equilibrium from it. 

At equilibrium, there is no difference between elastic and inelastic bodies.*
