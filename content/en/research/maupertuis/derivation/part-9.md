<!-- ### Problem 2: Laws of Motion for Elastic Bodies -->

Let there be two elastic bodies of masses `m1` and `m2` moving in the same direction with speeds `v1` and `v2`, respectively. 

`v1` is faster so that it overtakes the `m2` and collides with it.

Let `u1` and `u2` represent the speeds of the 2 bodies after the collision.

The sum or difference of these speeds is the same as that before the collision. 


`m1` was moving at speed `v1` and was covering a distance `v1` per unit time. The universe changed so that now `m1` moves at speed `u1` and covers a distance `u1` per unit time.

`m2` was moving at speed `v2` covering a distance `v2` per unit time. Now it moves at speed `u2` and covers a distance `u2` per unit time.

This change would be the same if:

- while `Body 1` was moving at speed `v1` and was covering a distance `v1` per unit time, it was being transported backwards by an invisible, massless plane moving at speed `v1 - u1` and covering a distance `v1 - u1` 
per unit time
- while `Body 2` was moving at speed `v2` and was covering a distance `v2` per unit time, it was being transported forwards by an invisible, massless plane moving at speed `u2 - v2`, covering a distance `u2 - v2` per unit time.

The motion of these immaterial planes conveying the masses `m1` and `m2` are the same, regardless of whether the masses are moving relative to these planes or are at rest.

Hence, the quantities of action produced in Nature are m1(v1 - u1)^2 and m2(u2 - v2)^2, the sum of which should be minimized. 

Thus, we have:


For elastic bodies, the relative speed after the impact should equal the relative speed before the impact; hence,
we have
or, rather,
and, thus,
. Substitution into the
preceding equation yields the final speeds
and
It is easy to extend the same reasoning to the case where the two bodies are moving towards each other, by
making the second speed
negative. In that case, the final speeds are
and
If the second body is at rest before the impact,
, and the final speeds are
and

If the first body encounters an impassable barrier, one can consider that barrier as a body of infinite mass at rest.
In that case, the final speed
, i.e., the first mass rebounds at the same speed with which it struck the
barrier.

If one takes the sum of the kinetic energies, one sees that they are the same after the impact as before; thus,
the sum of the kinetic energies is conserved after the impact. However, this conservation applied only to elastic
bodies, and not to inelastic bodies. The general principle that applies to both types of bodies is that the quantity
of action required to cause a change in Nature is as small as possible.

This principle is so universal and so fruitful that one can also derive the law of mechanical equilibrium from it.
At equilibrium, there is no difference between elastic and inelastic bodies.


### Problem 3: Law of Mechanical Equilibrium for Bodies

Two bodies are attached to a lever. At what point will they remain in equilibrium?

Thus, I seek the point where, if the lever moves slightly, the quantity of action is as small as
possible.

Let `L` be the length of the lever (which I suppose to be massless), and let two masses and be placed at either end.

`z` is the distance from the `m1` to the equilibrium point being sought.

`L - z` is the distance to `m2`. 

If the lever rotates slightly around a point, the 2 masses describe geometrically similar arcs. 

Their size is proportional to their respective distances from the point of rotation. 

Thus, these arcs are the distances traveled by the bodies and also represent their speeds per unit time.

Hence, the quantity of action is proportional to the product of the mass of each body multiplied by the square of its arc length.

Or, equivalently (since the two arcs are geometrically similar), the quantity of action is proportional to the product of the mass of each body multiplied by the square of its distance to the point of rotation, i.e., the equation 

and

 

The sum of these two terms should be minimized, giving or, rather, from which the equilibrium position may be derived This is the basic law of mechanical equilibrium.
