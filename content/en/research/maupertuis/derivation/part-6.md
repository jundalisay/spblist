<!-- ### III. Research: Certain Laws of Motion and Equilibrium -->

Whether at rest or moving, all material bodies have a force that works to maintain them in their current state of motion.

This force, denoted inertia, is proportional to the amount of matter they contain.

The two properties, impenetrability and inertia, of material bodies are always opposed to one another in Nature,
making laws necessary to bring them into harmony. 

When two bodies encounter one another, they cannot penetrate one another and, therefore, the rest of one and the motion of the other (or the motion of both) must be changed. Since this change depends on the force with which the two bodies collide, let us examine the nature of the collision and the factors affecting its force; and if we cannot obtain a sufficiently clear idea of its force, at least let us determine the conditions under which the force is the same.

We make several assumptions here that are common to all researchers who have studied the laws of motion. Specifically, we assume that the bodies collide directly, i.e., that their centers of gravity move only along in the straight line that connects them; that the point of contact in the collision lies on this line; and that the tangent surfaces at the point of contact are penpendicular to this line. This last condition is always true if the two bodies are solid spheres composed of a homogenous material, as we assume here.

If a body moves with a certain speed and encounters a second body at rest, the impact would be the same as if the second body, moving with the speed of the first, had collided with the first body at rest. If two bodies move in opposite directions and collide, the impact would be the same as if one body were at rest and the second body moved with a speed equal to the sum of the original two speeds.

If two bodies move in the same direction and collide, the impact would be the same as if one body were at rest and the second body moved with a speed equal to the difference of the original two speeds. Thus, whenever two bodies collide, the impact is generally the same as long as their relative speed (i.e., the sum or difference of their speeds) is the same, regardless of their individual speeds. The magnitude of the impact depends only on the relative speed of the two colliding bodies.

The truth of this proposition is easy to see, by imaging both bodies being transported on an invisible, massless
plane moving such that the speed of one body vanishes and the second body has either the sum or the difference
of the original two speeds. The impact of the two bodies on the moving place would be the same as on a
stationary plane.

Let us now consider the effects of elasticity on the collision.

In a perfectly inelastic body, the parts are inseparable and inflexible; hence, its shape simply cannot be
changed.


In a perfectly elastic body, the parts may deform, but always recover to exactly their original shape and
situation. We do not undertake to explain the origin of this elasticity, merely its effects.

I will not discuss "squishy" or fluid bodies at all, since they are composed of inelastic or elastic bodies.
When two inelastic bodies collide, their parts are inseparable and inflexible; hence, the impact can affect only
their speed. The two bodies press and push until the speed of the first equals the speed of the second. After the
impact, inelastic bodies move with a common speed.

However, when two elastic bodies collide, while the are pressing and pushing, the impact serves to deform their
parts. The two bodies do not remain touching each other; the restoration of their former shape causes them to
rebound from one another, separating from one another at the same speed with which they approached. 

For their
relative speed was the sole cause of their initial collision and the rebounding should produce an effect equal to
that which caused the collision; thus, the final relative speed of the two bodies should equal the initial relative
speed, albeit with opposite direction. Hence, the final relative speed of two elastic bodies after the collision
should be the same as the initial relative speed.

Let us now seek the laws that govern the distribution of motion among colliding bodies, whether they be elastic
or inelastic.

We will derive these laws from only one principle and, from the same principle, we will derive the laws of
mechanical equilibrium.
