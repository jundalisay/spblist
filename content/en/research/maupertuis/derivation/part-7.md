## General Principle

When a change occurs in Nature, the quantity of action necessary for that change is as small as possible.

The quantity of action is the product of the mass of the bodies times their speed and the distance they travel.

When a body is transported from one place to another, the action is proportional to the mass of the body, to its speed and to the distance over which it is transported.

### Problem I: Laws of Motion for Inelastic Bodies

Two inelastic bodies of masses and moving in the same direction with speeds and , respectively. Let the first mass move more quickly, so that it overtakes the second mass and collides with it.

After the collision, let the common velocity of the two bodies be such that 

... 

The change in the universe is that, whereas the first mass was moving at a speed and was covering a distance per unit time, it now moves only at a speed and covers only a distance per unit time; and whereas the second mass was moving only at a speed and was covering only a distance per unit time, it now moves at speed and covers a distance per unit time.

This change would be the same if while the first body was moving at speed and was covering a distance per unit time, it were being transported backwards by an invisible, massless plane moving at speed and covering a distance per unit time; and while the second body was moving at speed and was covering a distance per unit time) it were being transported forwards by an invisible, massless plane moving at speed and covering a distance per unit time.

The motion of these immaterial planes conveying the masses and are the same, regardless of whether the masses are moving relative to these planes or are at rest. Hence, the quantities of action produced in Nature are and , the sum of which should be minimized. Thus, we have or, rather, from which one can derive the final speed In this case where the two bodies are moving in the same direction, the quantity of momentum produced and destroyed is the same; the total momentum is constant, being the same after the impact as beforehand. It is easy to extend the same reasoning to the case where the two bodies are moving towards each other, by making the second speed negative. In that case, the final speed is If the second body is at rest before the impact, , and the final speed is If the first body encounters an impassable barrier, one can consider that barrier as a body of infinite mass at rest; since is infinite, the final speed

..
.

Now let us consider what happens to elastic bodies, by which I mean perfectly elastic bodies.


### Problem II: Laws of Motion for Elastic Bodies

Let there be two elastic bodies of masses
and
moving in the same direction with speeds
and ,
respectively. Let the first mass move more quickly, so that it overtakes the second mass and collides with it. Let
and
represent the speeds of the two bodies after the collision; the sum or difference of these speeds is the
same as that before the collision.
The change in the universe is that, whereas the first mass was moving at speed
and was covering a distance
per unit time, now it moves at speed
and covers a distance
per unit time; and whereas the second mass
was moving at speed
and was covering a distance
per unit time, now it moves at speed
and covers a
distance
per unit time.

This change would be the same if
while the first body was moving at speed
and was covering a distance
per unit time, it were
being transported backwards by an invisible, massless plane moving at speed
and
covering a distance
per unit time; and
while the second body was moving at speed
and was covering a distance
per unit time, it
were being transported forwards by an invisible, massless plane moving at speed
and
covering a distance
per unit time.
The motion of these immaterial planes conveying the masses
and
are the same, regardless of whether
the masses are moving relative to these planes or are at rest. Hence, the quantities of action produced in Nature
are
and
, the sum of which should be minimized. Thus, we have
or, rather,
For elastic bodies, the relative speed after the impact should equal the relative speed before the impact; hence,
we have
or, rather,
and, thus,
. Substitution into the
preceding equation yields the final speeds
and
It is easy to extend the same reasoning to the case where the two bodies are moving towards each other, by
making the second speed
negative. In that case, the final speeds are
and
If the second body is at rest before the impact,
, and the final speeds are
and

If the first body encounters an impassable barrier, one can consider that barrier as a body of infinite mass at rest.
In that case, the final speed
, i.e., the first mass rebounds at the same speed with which it struck the
barrier.

If one takes the sum of the kinetic energies, one sees that they are the same after the impact as before; thus,
the sum of the kinetic energies is conserved after the impact. However, this conservation applied only to elastic
bodies, and not to inelastic bodies. The general principle that applies to both types of bodies is that the quantity
of action required to cause a change in Nature is as small as possible.

This principle is so universal and so fruitful that one can also derive the law of mechanical equilibrium from it.
At equilibrium, there is no difference between elastic and inelastic bodies.


### Problem III: Law of Mechanical Equilibrium for Bodies

Two bodies are attached to a lever, and I seek the point about which they remain in equilibrium. Thus, I seek the point about which, if the lever moves slightly, the quantity of action is as small as
possible. 

Let be the length of the lever (which I suppose to be massless), and let two masses and be placed at either end. 

If represents the distance from the first mass to the equilibrium point being sought, then represents the corresponding distance to the second mass . Obviously, if the lever rotates slightly about a point, the two masses describe geometrically similar arcs, whose size is proportional to their respective distances from the point of rotation. Thus, these arcs are the distances traveled by the bodies and also represent their speeds per unit time.

Hence, the quantity of action is proportional to the product of the mass of each body multiplied by the square of its arc length; or, equivalently (since the two arcs are geometrically similar), the quantity of action is proportional to the product of the mass of each body multiplied by the square of its distance to the point of rotation, i.e., the equation and . 

The sum of these two terms should be minimized, giving or, rather, from which the equilibrium position may be derived This is the basic law of mechanical equilibrium.
