<!-- Before beginning any spiritual text it is customary to clear the mind of all distracting thoughts, to calm the breath and to purify the heart. -->

<sup>1</sup> Now, instructions for Yoga (Union).

<!-- > atha yoga-anuaasanam -->


<sup>2</sup> Yoga is the stilling of the fluctuations of the mind <sup>3</sup> so that the meditator dwells in his true nature.

<!-- > yoga citta-vrtti-nirodha, tadaa drastuh svarupe ‘vasthânam -->

<!-- // -stuff (citta) -->

<sup>4</sup> Otherwise, he identifies with his thoughts.

<!-- > vrtti-sârûpyam itaratra -->

<!-- propensities -->
<sup>5</sup> The thoughts are five-fold, with positive and negative variations.

<!-- propensities -->

<!-- // painful and not painful: -->

<sup>6</sup> 

1. Correct thoughts

<sup>7</sup> The correct thoughts come from the direct senses, inference, and testimonies from teachers or established knowledge.

2. Erroneous thoughts

<sup>8</sup> The erroneous thoughts come from false knowledge, not based on truth.

3. Ideation

<sup>9</sup> Ideation comes from acoustic knowledge [mantra], applied on emptiness.

4. Sleep

<sup>10</sup> Deep sleep is the lack of perceptions.

5. Memory

<sup>11</sup> Memory is the retention of experiences

{{< n n="These come from the 5 layers: Matter (Erroneous thoughts), Convertible (Correct thoughts), Radiant (Memory), Spacetime (Sleep), Aethereal (Ideation)" >}}



<!-- without any object -->

<!-- Fancy is following after word-knowledge empty of substance. -->

<!-- modification of the mind which has for its substratum nothingness. -->

 <!-- not allowing mental impressions to escape. -->


## Meditation

<sup>12</sup> Two things are needed to still the mind:

1. Practice

<sup>13</sup> Practice is the sustained effort to secure that stillness. <sup>14</sup> This practice becomes firmly rooted when it is cultivated skillfully and continuously for a long time.

2. Non-reaction 

<!-- 1.12. These thought-streams are controlled by practice and non-attachment. -->

<!-- This practice becomes well-grounded when continued with reverent devotion and without interruption over a long period of time. -->

<sup>15</sup>  Non-reaction is fully achieved when no attachment arises in regard to anything at all, whether perceived directly or learned. <sup>16</sup> When the ultimate level of non-attachment is achieved, the mind can see pure consciousness.

<!-- Desirelessness towards the seen and the unseen gives the consciousness of mastery. -->

<!-- reaction has been reached, pure awareness can clearly see itself as
independent from the fundamental qualities of nature. -->


<!-- 1.16. This is signified by an indifference to the three attributes, due to knowledge of the Indweller. -->

<sup>17</sup> At first, the stilling process is accompanied by 4 kinds of cognition:

1. Analytical thinking
2. Insight
3. Bliss
4. Self-Awareness


<!-- 1.17. Cognitive meditation is accompanied by reasoning, discrimination, bliss and the sense of 'I am.' -->

<sup>18</sup> Later, with constant practice, these four kinds of cognition fall away, leaving only samskara. <sup>19</sup> After death, the soul is reborn according to these samskaras through Prakrti.

{{< n n="Samskara is potential karma. Throwing a rock into the air is action or karma. Its hitting the ground is the result of the action and is also karma. Samskara is the period right after throwing the rock and before it lands. By burning samskara then the consequences of the rock hitting the ground are nullified. The rock will still hit, but whatever it hits will not create a consequence for the thrower. Without consequence, then the thrower is not agitated or worried or hopeful about his throwing the rock. Another way to think of samskara is unfinished business. Without unfinished business, then the soul has no reason to reincarnate. " >}}



<!-- after one practices steadily to bring all thought to a standstill,  -->



<!--   latent impressions are dissolved in nature, they are inclined to be
reborn. -->

<sup>20</sup> For all others, faith, energy, mindfulness, integration, and wisdom form the path to realization. <sup>21</sup> For those who seek liberation passionately, realization is near.

<!-- 1.18. There is another meditation which is attained by the practice of alert mental suspension until only subtle impressions remain.

1.19. For those beings who are formless and for those beings who are merged in unitive consciousness, the world is the cause. -->

<!-- 1.20. For others, clarity is preceded by faith, energy, memory and equalminded contemplation. -->


<sup>22</sup> This nearness depends on whether the practice is mild, moderate, or intense, <sup>23</sup> or if the soul has surrendered to the Supreme Isvara*.

{{< n n="Isvara here means the controlling aspect of the Universe " >}}


<!-- 1.21. Equalminded contemplation is nearest to those whose desire is most ardent.

1.22. There is further distinction on account of the mild, moderate or intense means employed.

1.23. Or by surrender to God. -->

<!-- Isvara -->
<sup>24</sup> The Supreme is a distinct, incorruptible form of pure consciousness, utterly independent of cause and effect, and lacking any samskara.

 <!-- store of latent impressions. -->

<sup>25</sup> This makes it the source of all knowledge.

<!-- 1.24. God is a particular yet universal indweller, untouched by afflictions, actions, impressions and their results. -->

<!-- 1.25. In God, the seed of omniscience is unsurpassed. -->

<sup>26</sup> The Supreme was the guru of the ancients.

<!-- 1.26. Not being conditioned by time, God is the teacher of even the ancients. -->

<sup>27</sup> The Supreme's sound is Om*.

{{< n n="The Om sound is used to maintain the Universe. You can think of this as the rumble that a machine makes as a sign that it is running. Is the Om sound the cause or the effect? We think it is the effect and that's why some spiritual people can hear it." >}}


<sup>28</sup> By repetitively chanting the Om sound, the meaning of the Om sound is realized. <sup>29</sup> Then inner consciousness is attained and obstacles disappear. 

<!-- 1.28. The repetition of Om should be made with an understanding of its meaning. -->

<sup>30</sup> Sickness, apathy, doubt, carelessness, laziness, hedonism, delusion, lack of progress, and inconstancy are all distractions stir up consciousness and act as barriers to stillness.

<sup>31</sup> When distracted, one may experience distress, depression, or the inability to maintain steadiness of posture or breathing.


<!-- 1.29. From that is gained introspection and also the disappearance of obstacles.

1.30. Disease, inertia, doubt, lack of enthusiasm, laziness, sensuality, mind-wandering, missing the point, instability- these distractions of the mind are the obstacles. -->

<!-- 1.31. Pain, despair, nervousness, and disordered inspiration and expiration are co-existent with these obstacles. -->

<sup>32</sup> One can subdue these distractions by working with any one of the following principles of practice.

<sup>33</sup> Your consciousness settles:

- by radiating friendliness, compassion, delight, and equanimity toward all things, whether pleasant or painful, good or bad, or

<!-- 1.32. For the prevention of the obstacles, one truth should be practiced constantly. -->

- by <sup>34</sup> pausing after each breath flows in or out,

<!-- 1.33. By cultivating friendliness towards happiness and compassion towards misery, gladness towards virtue and indifference towards vice, the mind becomes pure. -->

<!-- 1.34. Optionally, mental equanimity may be gained by the even expulsion and retention of energy. -->

- by <sup>35</sup> steadily observing as new sensations materialize, <sup>36</sup> being free from light or dark, or <sup>37</sup> desire and attachment 

<!-- 1.35. Or activity of the higher senses causes mental steadiness. -->

<!-- - by <sup>35</sup>
1.36. Or the state of sorrowless Light. -->

- by <sup>38</sup> reflecting on the insights from dreams 

<!-- 1.37. Or the mind taking as an object of concentration those who are freed of compulsion.

1.38. Or depending on the knowledge of dreams and sleep. -->

- by <sup>39</sup> meditating whenever desired. <sup>40</sup> By doing so, one expands from small to the great.


<!-- 1.40. The mastery of one in Union extends from the finest atomic particle to the greatest infinity. -->


## Samadhi

<sup>41</sup> When the mind becomes still, it becomes like a transparent crystal which has the power of becoming whatever form is presented: knower, act of knowing, or what is known.

 <!-- agitations of the mind are under control, the mind  -->

<sup>42</sup> When the true essence of the sound is understood, then the mind is absorbed in the Supreme.

 <!-- The argumentative condition is the confused mixing of the word, its right meaning, and knowledge. -->


<sup>43</sup> Then the memory is purified and the mind becomes empty and goes beyond thought. 

<!-- 1.43. When the memory is purified and the mind shines forth as the object alone, it is called non-argumentative. -->

<sup>44</sup> In this way, the objects of the mind become either reflective or non-reflective. 

 <!-- meditative and the ultra-meditative having the subtle for their objects are also described. -->

<sup>45</sup> The essence of the subtle objects can be attained. 

 <!-- province of the subtle terminates with pure matter that has no pattern or distinguishing mark. -->


<sup>46</sup> These constitute the seed of samadhi.

<sup>47</sup> Samadhi is the state of attaining the pure innermost self without any reflections.  

<!-- On attaining the purity of the ultra-meditative state there is the pure flow of spiritual consciousness. -->

<sup>48</sup> It is the state of True Wisdom.

<!-- 1.48. Therein is the faculty of supreme wisdom. -->

<sup>49</sup> It can discern the wisdom from teachings.

<sup>50</sup> It prevents samskaras from creating new samskaras. 

<!-- 1.49. The wisdom obtained in the higher states of consciousness is different from that obtained by inference and testimony as it refers to particulars. -->

<sup>51</sup> Continued stillness allows the highest [seedless] Samadhi to be attained. 

<!-- 1.50. The habitual pattern of thought stands in the way of other impressions.

1.51. With the suppression of even that through the suspension of all modifications of the mind, contemplation without seed is attained. -->
