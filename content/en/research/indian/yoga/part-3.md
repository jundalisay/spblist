<sup>1</sup> Mental focus binds the mind into a single point.

<sup>2</sup> Dhyana is focusing all of the mind's perceptual flow into one object <sup>3</sup> so that the mind sheds its own form and attains samadhi with that object. 

<sup>4</sup> These three then become one discipline:

1. Dharana (Mental Focus)
2. Dhyana (Intense Meditation on an Object)
2. Samadhi (Realization)

<sup>5</sup> This leads to True Wisdom, <sup>6</sup> and is done in stages.

<sup>7</sup> These three limbs are are more interiorized and seedless than the preceding five (Yama, Niyama, Asanas, Pranayama, Pratyahara) <sup>8</sup> external limbs.



<!-- 3.2 Unbroken continuation of that mental ability is meditation.

3.3 That same meditation when there is only consciousness of the object of meditation and not of the mind is realization.

3.4 The three appearing together are self-control.

3.5 By mastery comes wisdom. -->

<!-- 3.6 The application of mastery is by stages.

3.7 The three are more efficacious than the restraints.

3.8 Even that is external to the seedless realization. -->


<sup>9</sup> The end of mental flow leads to the end of thought. These subjugate the external world and leads to the end of samskara, <sup>10</sup> letting the mind flow into tranquility.

<sup>11</sup> Through one-pointed focus, the mind flows into samadhi. 


<!--  end of the emergence of samskara. 

suppression of thoughts brought about by the external world. 

3.9 The significant aspect is the union of the mind with the moment of absorption, when the outgoing thought disappears and the absorptive experience appears.

3.10 From sublimation of this union comes the peaceful flow of unbroken unitive cognition. -->


<sup>12</sup> Through one-pointed focus, the rise and fall of thought-waves cancel each other out.  <sup>13</sup> Through this layer, the nature of the soul is revealed through time, condition, and dharma.

<sup>14</sup> The nature of the manifest, unmanifest, and soon-to-manifest follow the dharma.

<sup>15</sup> The variations of the flow cause a real transformation.  

<sup>16</sup> Observing the pattern of changes of the three (time, condition, and dharma) will lead to the knowledge of past and future. 

<sup>17</sup> Sound, words, and meaning get mixed up. Discernment through discipline sorts through the mess and reveals the knowledge of all the Layers of Reality. 

<sup>18</sup> Directly observing one's samkaras with perfect discipline yields insight into previous births.

<sup>19</sup> By applying perfect discipline on the perceptions of another person, one gains insights on that person’s mind <sup>20</sup>  even if such insights are not the acual reality now. 

<sup>21</sup> By applying perfect discipline on one's own body, it becomes invisible. The eyes of others are disengaged from incoming light, and their power to perceive is suspended.

<sup>22</sup> Likewise, through perfect discipline other percepts - sound, smell, taste, touch - can be made to disappear.

<sup>23</sup> The results of karma may come immediately or slowly. By applying perfect discipline on one's actions, knowledge on death or omens is gained.

<sup>24</sup> By focusing with perfect discipline on friendliness and positive traits, one gains such strengths. 

<sup>25</sup> For example, by focusing with perfect discipline on the strengths of an elephant, one acquires the strength of an elephant, and so on.

<sup>26</sup> Focusing on the brightness from activities yields insight about the subtle, hidden, and distant.

<sup>27</sup> Focusing with perfect discipline on the heart chakra or solar plexus [sun] yields insight about the universe.

<sup>28</sup> Focusing with perfect discipline on the third-eye chakra or lunar plexus [moon] yields insight about the stars’ positions [which is needed for predicting the future].

<sup>29</sup> Focusing with perfect discipline on the crown chakra [polestar] yields insight about their movements.

<sup>30</sup> Focusing with perfect discipline on the navel chakra yields insight about the organization of the body.

<sup>31</sup> Focusing with perfect discipline on the throat chakra eradicates hunger and thirst.

<sup>32</sup> Focusing with perfect discipline on the flow of air through the nostrils lets one cultiate steadiness.

<sup>33</sup> Focusing with perfect discipline on the crown chakra gives one visionary powers <sup>34</sup> or spontaneous illumination.

<sup>35</sup> Focusing with perfect discipline on the heart chakra, one understands the nature of consciousness.

<sup>36</sup> Perfect discipline on one's own nature leads to True Knowledge that separates the awareness of the sentient principle with the perceptions of the phenomenal world. 	 

<sup>37</sup>  Following this insight, the senses - hearing, feeling, seeing, tasting, smelling - may suddenly be enhanced.

<sup>38</sup> These powers may feel like attainments, but they distract one from samadhi.

<sup>39</sup> By relaxing one’s attachment to the body, and becoming profoundly sensitive to its currents, consciousness can enter another’s body.

<sup>40</sup>  By mastering the flow of energy in the head and neck, one can walk through water, mud, thorns, and other obstacles without touching down, but rather floating over them.

<sup>41</sup> By mastering the flow of energy through the heart chakra or solar plexus, one becomes radiant.

<sup>42</sup> By focusing with perfect discipline on the way sound travels through the ether, one acquires divine hearing.

<sup>43</sup> By focusing with perfect discipline on one's aethereal body, it becomes as light as cotton and can travel through space. 

<!-- the body’s relationship to the ether, and developing coalesced
contemplation on the lightness of cotton, one can travel through space. -->

<sup>44</sup> When consciousness completely disengages from external thought - as the ‘great disembodiment’ - then the veil that covers the brightness of the mind is lifted.

<sup>45</sup> By focusing with perfect discipline on the 5 Layers of Reality, one learns the function of the gross [material], subtle [aether], inherent [radiance], pervading [spacetime], and purposeful [convertible]. 

<!-- By observing the aspects of matter - gross, subtle, intrinsic, relational, purposive - with perfect
discipline, one masters the Layers . -->

<sup>46</sup> These lead to the power to perceive the minutely small and those beyond normal perception. This leads to the perfection of the body as true dharma.

<!-- 
be quantum 
Then extraordinary faculties appear, including the power to shrink to the size of an atom, as the body
attains perfection, transcending Physics. -->

<sup>47</sup> This perfection includes beauty, grace, strength, and the durability of a diamond.

<sup>48</sup> Perfect discipline leads to the understanding of ego which then leads to the mastery of the senses. 

<!-- By observing the various aspects of the sense organs - their processes of perception, intrinsic natures, identification as self, interconnectedness, purposes - with perfect discipline, one masters them. -->


<sup>49</sup> Then, free from the constraints of their organs, the senses perceive with the quickness of the mind, no longer in the sway of the phenomenal world.

<sup>50</sup> Through the awareness of the sentient principle, one can discern all the states of mind, leading to the mastery of the mind. 

 <!-- just sees the distinction between pure awareness and the luminous aspect of the phenomenal world, all conditions are known and mastered. -->

<sup>51</sup> When the soul is unattached even to this omniscience and mastery, the seeds of suffering wither, and pure consciousness stands alone.

<sup>52</sup> Even if the exalted praise you, you must avoid attachment and pride, or else suffering will recur.

<sup>53</sup> Focusing with perfect discipline on the nature of time gives an inborn discernment skill.

<sup>54</sup> This skill allows one to tell things apart which, through similarities of origin, feature, or situtation, had seemed continuous.

<sup>55</sup> In this way, discernment deconstructs all of the phenomenal world’s objects and conditions, setting them apart from pure awareness.

<sup>56</sup> Once the luminosity and transparency of consciousness have become as distilled as pure awareness, they can reflect the freedom of awareness back to itself.

<!-- 3.12 The mind becomes one-pointed when the subsiding and rising thought-waves are exactly similar.

3.13 In this state, it passes beyond the changes of inherent characteristics, properties and the conditional modifications of object or sensory recognition.

3.14 The object is that which preserves the latent characteristic, the rising characteristic or the yet-to-be-named characteristic that establishes one entity as specific.

3.15 The succession of these changes in that entity is the cause of its modification.

3.16 By self-control over these three-fold changes (of property, character and condition), knowledge of the past and the future arises.

3.17 The sound of a word, the idea behind the word, and the object the idea signfies are often taken as being one thing and may be mistaken for one another. By self-control over their distinctions, understanding of all languages of all creatures arises.

3.18 By self-control on the perception of mental impressions, knowledge of previous lives arises.

3.19 By self-control on any mark of a body, the wisdom of the mind activating that body arises.

3.20 By self-control on the form of a body, by suspending perceptibility and separating effulgence therefrom, there arises invisibility and inaudibilty.

3.21 Action is of two kinds, dormant and fruitful. By self-control on such action, one portends the time of death.

3.22 By performing self-control on friendliness, the strength to grant joy arises.

3.23 By self-control over any kind of strength, such as that of the elephant, that very strength arises.

3.24 By self-control on the primal activator comes knowledge of the hidden, the subtle, and the distant.

3.25 By self-control on the Sun comes knowledge of spatial specificities.

3.26 By self-control on the Moon comes knowledge of the heavens.

3.27 By self-control on the Polestar arises knowledge of orbits.

3.28 By self-control on the navel arises knowledge of the constitution of the body.

3.29 By self-control on the pit of the throat one subdues hunger and thirst.

3.30 By self-control on the tube within the chest one acquires absolute steadiness.

3.31 By self-control on the light in the head one envisions perfected beings.

3.32 There is knowledge of everything from intuition.

3.33 Self-control on the heart brings knowledge of the mental entity.

3.34 Experience arises due to the inability of discerning the attributes of vitality from the indweller, even though they are indeed distinct from one another. Self-control brings true knowledge of the indweller by itself.

3.35 This spontaneous enlightenment results in intuitional perception of hearing, touching, seeing and smelling.

3.36 To the outward turned mind, the sensory organs are perfections, but are obstacles to realization.

3.37 When the bonds of the mind caused by action have been loosened, one may enter the body of another by knowledge of how the nerve-currents function.

3.38 By self-control of the nerve-currents utilising the lifebreath, one may levitate, walk on water, swamps, thorns, or the like.

3.39 By self-control over the maintenance of breath, one may radiate light.

3.40 By self-control on the relation of the ear to the ether one gains distant hearing.

3.41 By self-control over the relation of the body to the ether, and maintaining at the same time the thought of the lightness of cotton, one is able to pass through space.

3.42 By self-control on the mind when it is separated from the body- the state known as the Great Transcorporeal- all coverings are removed from the Light.

3.43 Mastery over the elements arises when their gross and subtle forms,as well as their essential characteristics, and the inherent attributes and experiences they produce, is examined in self-control.

3.44 Thereby one may become as tiny as an atom as well as having many other abilities, such as perfection of the body, and non-resistence to duty.

3.45 Perfection of the body consists in beauty, grace, strength and adamantine hardness.

3.46 By self-control on the changes that the sense-organs endure when contacting objects, and on the power of the sense of identity, and of the influence of the attributes, and the experience all these produce- one masters the senses.

3.47 From that come swiftness of mind, independence of perception, and mastery over primoridal matter.

3.48 To one who recognizes the distinctive relation between vitality and indweller comes omnipotence and omniscience.

3.49 Even for the destruction of the seed of bondage by desirelessness there comes absolute independence.

3.50 When invited by invisible beings one should be neither flattered nor satisfied, for there is yet a possibility of ignorance rising up.

3.51 By self-control over single moments and their succession there is wisdom born of discrimination.

3.52 From that there is recognition of two similars when that difference cannot be distinguished by class, characteristic or position.

3.53 Intuition, which is the entire discriminative knowledge, relates to all objects at all times, and is without succession.

3.54 Liberation is attained when there is equal purity between vitality and the indweller. -->
