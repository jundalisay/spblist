What is elevation and depression; Then do ye, O Indra and Agni, Scatter my foes on every side. c To the Vasus thee, to the Rudras thee, to the Adityas thee! d Licking the anointed lot the birds go asunder. e May I not brush offispring and the organ. f Swell, ye waters and plants. g Ye are the spotted steeds of the Maruts. h Fare to the sky [1], thence bring us rain. i Guardian of life art thou, O Agni, guard my life. k Guardian of the eye art thou, O Agni, guard my eye. I Thou art the secure one. m The fence which thou didst put round thee When thou wast beset by the Panis, O god Agni, That do I bring here to thee that thou mayst rejoice in it, That it be not removed from thee. n Go ye two to the place of the gods. o Ye are sharers in the remains (of the oblation), well nourished, mighty Ye gods that are on the prastara and sit on the strew [2]. Accepting this supplication, do ye all, Seated on this strew enjoy yourselves. p I set thee in the seat of Agni whose abode is secure. q For goodwill, O ye two with goodwill, place me in goodwill. r Guard ye the yoke-horses at the yoke. s O Agni, with life unhurt, with not-cool body, guard me this day from the sky, guard from bondage, guard from error in sacrifice, guard from evil food, guard from ill deed. t Make our food free from poison, the lap pleasant to sit in; hail! u O ye gods that know the way, knowing the way, go ye the way. v O lord of mind, this sacrifice for us place among the gods, O god, hail! in speech, hail! in the wind, hail! i. 1. 14.

a Ye twain shall be summoned, O Indra and Agni. Ye twain shall rejoice together in the offering. You both givers of food and riches, You both I summon for the winning of strength. b For I have heard that ye both are more generous Than a worthless son-in-law or a wife's brother. So with the offering of Soma I make for you, O 1ndra and Agni, a new hymn of praise; c O Indra and Agni, ninety forts Of which the Dasas were lords ye overtbrew Together in one deed. d This pure new-born hymn of praise this day, O Indra and Agni, slayers of Vrtra, accept with joy [1]. 

For on you both I call that are ready to listen, You that are ever readiest to give strength to the eager. e We thee, O lord of the path, As a chariot to win the prize, Have yoked for our prayer, O Pusan. f Lord of each way with eloquence; Driven by love he went to Arka; May he give us the comfort of gold, May Pusan further our every prayer. g By the lord of the field As by a friend may we win What nourishes our kine and horses; May he be [2] favourable to such as we are. h O lord of the field, the honey-bearing wave, As a cow milk, so for us milk; May the lords of right graciously accord us That which drops honey and is well purified like ghee. i O Agni, lead us by a fair path to wealth, O god, knowing all the ways; Keep away from us the sin that makes us wander; We will accord to thee most abundant honour. k

We have come to the path of the gods To accomplish that which we have power to do; Let wise Agni sacrifice [3], let him be Hotr Let him arrange the offerings him the seasons. l What carrieth best is for Agni; Sing aloud, O thou of brilliant radiance. From thee wealth, like a cow, From thee strength riseth forth. m O Agni, once more lead us With thy favour over every trouble. Be a broad, thick, wide fortress for us, Health and wealth for our children and descendants. Thou, O Agni, art the guardian of law, Among the gods and mortals; Thou art to be invoked at the sacrifices. o If laws of you wise ones, O gods, In our ignorance we transgress, May Agni make good all that, He that knoweth the seasons wherein he may satisfy the gods.
