Friday, December 14, 1883

At 9AM Sri Ramakrishna was standing on the southeast verandah
near the door of his room, with Ramlal by his side. Rākhāl and Lātu were moving
about. M. arrived and prostrated himself before the Master. 

Sri Ramakrishna said to him affectionately: "You have come. That's very good. Today is an auspicious day."
It was the last day of the Bengali month and the day of the full moon. M. was going to
spend a few days with the Master practising spiritual discipline. The Master had said to
him, "If an aspirant practises a little spiritual discipline, then someone comes forward to
help him."

The Master had said to M: "You should not eat every day at the guesthouse of the Kāli
temple. The guest-house is intended to supply free food to monks and the destitute.
Bring your own cook with you." M. had accordingly done so. The Master arranged a
place for the man to cook and he asked Ramlal to speak to the milkman about milk.
A little later Ramlal began to read from the Adhyātma Rāmāyana. The Master and M.
listened while he read:

Rāma had married Sita after breaking the great bow of Śiva. On the way to Ayhodhya
with His bride, Rāma was confronted by the warrior sage Parasurama, who was about to
make trouble for Him. Parasurama threw a bow at Rāma and challenged Him to string
it. Dasaratha, Rāma's father, was seized with fear. With a smile, Rāma took the bow in
His left hand and strung it. Then twanging the bow-string, He fixed an arrow and asked
Parasurama where to shoot it. That curbed the pride of the warrior sage. Prostrating
himself before Rāma, Parasurama worshipped Him as the Supreme Brahman.
As Sri Ramakrishna listened to Parasurama's hymn, he went into a spiritual mood and
now and then chanted the name of Rāma in his melodious voice.

Then the Master asked Ramlal to read about Guhaka. Ramlal read:
Guhaka, the pariah, was chief of the untouchables and an intimate friend of Rāma.
When Rāma, Sita, and Lakshmana were starting into the forest to redeem Dasaratha's
pledge, Guhaka ferried them across the river. Rāma embraced Guhaka tenderly and told
him He was going to spend fourteen years in exile, wearing the bark of trees and eating
herbs, fruits, and roots that grew in the woods. He promised to visit Guhaka again on
His way back to Ayhodhya after the period of exile was over. The pariah king waited
patiently. But when the fourteenth year had run out and Rāma had not returned,
Guhaka lighted a funeral pyre. He was on the point of entering it when Hanuman arrived
as Rāma's messenger. In a celestial chariot Rāma and Sita soon appeared, and
Guhaka's joy was unbounded.


After the midday meal Sri Ramakrishna lay down on his bed to rest. M. was seated on
the floor. Presently Dr. Shyama and a few devotees arrived. The Master sat up on the
bed and began to converse with them.

## Work and worship

MASTER: "It is by no means necessary for a man always to be engaged in his duties.
Actions drop away when one realizes, God, as the flower drops of itself when the fruit
appears.

"He who has realized God no longer performs religious duties such as the sandhya. In
his case the sandhya merges in the Gayatri. When that happens, it is enough for a
person to repeat just the Gayatri mantra. Then the Gayatri merges in Om. After that
one no longer chants even the Gayatri; it is enough then to chant simply Om. How long
should a man practise such devotions as the sandhya? As long as he does not feel a thrill
in his body and shed tears of joy while repeating the name of Rāma or of Hari. People
worship God to win money or a lawsuit. That is not good."
A DEVOTEE: "We find that everyone strives after money. Even Keshab Sen married his
daughter to a prince."
MASTER: "Keshab's case is quite different. God provides everything for a genuine
devotee, even without his making any effort. The son of a real king gets his monthly
allowance. I am not talking of lawyers and men of that sort, who go through suffering in
order to earn money, and who become slaves of others to that end. I am speaking of a
real prince. A true devotee has no desire. He does not care for money. Money comes
to him of itself. The Gitā describes such a devotee as 'content with what comes to him
without effort'. A good brahmin, without any personal motive, can accept food even
from the house of an untouchable. He does not desire it; it comes of its own accord."
How to live in the world
A DEVOTEE: "Sir, how should one live in the world?"
MASTER: "Live in the world as the mud fish lives in the mud. One develops love of God
by going away from the world into solitude, now and then, and meditating on God. After
that one can live in the world unattached. The mud is there, and the fish has to live in
it, but its body is not stained by the mud. Such a man can lead the life of a householder
in a spirit of detachment"
The Master noticed that M. was listening to his words with great attention.
MASTER (looking at M.): "One can realize God if one feels intense dispassion for worldly
things. A man with such dispassion feels that the world is like a forest on fire. He
regards his wife and children as a deep well. If he really feels that kind of dispassion, he
renounces home and family. It is not enough for him to live in the world in a spirit of
detachment.
371"'Woman and gold' alone is maya. If maya is once recognized, it feels ashamed of itself
and takes to flight. A man put on a tiger skin and tried to frighten another man. But the
latter said: 'Ah! I have recognized you! You are our Hare.' At that the man dressed in the
skin went away smiling to frighten someone else.
Women as embodiments of the Divine Mother
"All women are the embodiments of Śakti. It is the Primal Power that has become
women and appears to us in the form of women. It is said in the Adhyātma Rāmāyana
that Nārada and others praised Rāma, saying: 'O Rāma, Thou alone art all that we see
as male, and Sita, all that we see as female. Thou art Indra, and Sita is Indrani; Thou
art Śiva and Sita is Sivani; Thou art man, and Sita is woman. What more need I say?
Thou alone dost exist wherever there is a male, and Sita wherever there is a female.'
(To the devotees) "One cannot renounce by the mere wish. There are prarabdha karma-
inherited tendencies-and the like. Once a yogi said to a king, 'Live with me in the forest
and think of God.' The king replied: 'That I cannot very well do. I could live with you,
but I still have the desire for enjoyment. If I live in this forest, perhaps I shall create a
kingdom even here. I still have desires.'
"Natabar Panja used to look after his cows in this garden during his boyhood. He had
many desires. Hence he has established a castor-oil factory and earned a great deal of
money. He has a prosperous castor-oil business at Alambazar.
"There is one sect that prescribes spiritual discipline in company with women. I was
once taken to the women belonging to the Kartabhaja sect. They all sat around me. I
addressed them as 'mother'. At that they whispered among themselves: 'He is still a
pravartaka. He doesn't know the way.' According to that sect the pravartaka is the
beginner. Then comes the sadhaka, the struggling aspirant, and last of all the siddha of
the siddha, the supremely perfect. A woman walked over to Vaishnavcharan and sat
near him. Asked about it, he answered, 'She feels just like a young girl.' One quickly
strays from the religious path by looking on woman as wife: But to regard her as mother
is a pure attitude."
Some of the devotees took leave of the Master, saying that they were going to visit the
temple of Kāli and several of the other temples.
M. went walking alone in the Panchavati and other places in the temple garden. He
thought about the Master's assurance that God can be easily realized, and about his
exhortation to lead a life of intense renunciation, and his saying that maya, when
recognized, takes to flight.
Image worship
At half past three in the afternoon M. again entered the Master's room and sat on the
floor. A teacher from the Broughton Institution had come with several students to pay a
visit to Sri Ramakrishna. They were conversing together. Now and then the teacher
asked questions. The conversation was about the worship of images.
372MASTER (to the teacher): "What is wrong with image worship? The Vedānta says that
Brahman manifests Itself where there is 'Existence, Light, and Love'. Therefore nothing
exists but Brahman.
"How long do small girls play with their dolls? As long as they are not married and do not
live with their husbands. After marriage they put the dolls away in a box. What further
need is there of worshipping the image after the vision of God?"
God-vision through yearning
The Master glanced at M. and said: "One attains God when one feels yearning for Him.
An intense restlessness is needed. Through it the whole mind goes to God.
"A man had a daughter who became a widow when she was very young. She had never
known her husband: She noticed the husbands of other girls and said one day to her
father, 'Where is my husband?' The father replied: 'Govinda is your husband. He will
come to you if you call Him.' At these words the girl went to her room, closed the door,
and cried to Govinda, saying: 'O Govinda, corne to me! Show Yourself to me! Why don't
You come?' God could not resist the girl's piteous cry and appeared before her.
"One must have childlike faith-and the intense yearning that a child feels to see its
mother. That yearning is like the red sky in the east at dawn. After such a sky the sun
must rise. Immediately after that yearning one sees God.
"Let me tell you the story of a boy named Jatila. He used to walk to school through the
woods, and the journey frightened him; One day he told his mother of his fear. She
replied: 'Why should you be afraid? Call Madhusudana.' 'Mother,' asked the boy, 'who is
Madhusudana?' The mother said, 'He is your Elder Brother.' One day after this, when the
boy again felt afraid in the woods, he cried out, 'O Brother Madhusudana!' But there was
no response. He began to weep aloud: 'Where are You, Brother Madhusudana? Come to
me. I am afraid.' Then God could no longer stay away. He appeared before the boy and
said: 'Here I am. Why are you frightened?' And so, saying He took the boy out of the
woods and showed him the way to school. When He took leave of the boy, God said: 'I
will come whenever you call Me. Do not be afraid.' One must have this faith of a child,
this yearning.
"A brahmin used to worship his Family Deity daily with food offerings. One day he had
to go away on business. As he was about to leave the house, he said to his young son:
'Give the offering to the Deity today. See that God is fed.' The boy offered food in the
shrine, but the image remained silent on the altar. It would neither talk nor eat. The
boy waited a long time, but still the image did not move. But the boy firmly believed
that God would come down from His throne, sit on the floor, and partake of the food.
Again and again he prayed to the Deity, saying: 'O Lord, come down and eat the food.
It is already very late. I cannot sit here any longer.' But the image did not utter a word.
The boy burst into tears and cried: 'O Lord, my father asked me to feed You. Why won't
You come down? Why won't You eat from my hands?' The boy wept for some time with a
longing soul. At last the Deity, smiling, came down from the altar and sat before the
373meal and ate it. After feeding the Deity, the boy came out of the shrine room. His
relatives said: 'The worship is over. Now bring away the offering.' 'Yes,' said the boy,
'the worship is over. But God has eaten everything.' 'How is that?' asked the relatives.
The boy replied innocently, 'Why, God has eaten the food.' They entered the shrine and
were speechless with wonder to see that the Deity had really eaten every bit of the
offering."
Late in the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was talking to M. They were standing on the south
side of the nahabat. Since it was winter the Master was wrapped in his woolen shawl.
MASTER: "Where will you sleep? In the hut in the Panchavati?"
M: "Won't they let me have the room on the upper floor of the nahabat?"
M. selected the nahabat because he had a poetic temperament. From there he could see
the sky, the Ganges, the moonlight, and the flowers in the garden.
MASTER: "Oh, they'll let you have it. But I suggested the Panchavati because so much
contemplation and meditation have been practised there and the name of God has been
chanted there so often."
It was evening. Incense was burning in the Master's room. He was sitting on the small
couch, absorbed in meditation. M. was sitting on the floor with Rākhāl, Lātu, and
Ramlal.
Singing of devotional songs
The Master said to M., "The sum and substance of the whole thing is to cultivate
devotion for God and love Him." At Sri Ramakrishna's request Ramlal sang a few songs,
the Master himself singing the first line of each.
Ramlal sang:
Oh, what a vision I have beheld in Keshab Bharati's hut!
Gora, in all his matchless grace,
Shedding tears in a thousand streams!
Like a mad elephant
He dances in ecstasy and sings,
Drunk with an overwhelming love. . . .
Then he sang:
Though I am never loath to grant salvation,
I hesitate indeed to grant pure love.
Whoever wins pure love surpasses all;
He is adored by men;
He triumphs over the three worlds. . . .
Sri Ramakrishna said to Ramlal, “Sing that one- 'Gaur and Nitai, ye blessed brothers'. "
Ramlal began the song and the Master joined him:
374Gaur and Nitai, ye blessed brothers!
I have heard how kind you are,
And therefore I have come to you.
When I visited Benares,
Śiva, Lord of Kasi, told me
Of the Parabrahman's birth,
As man, in Mother Sachi's home.
O Brahman, Thee I recognize!
Many a sādhu have I seen,
But never one so kind as you.
Once at Braja you were born
As Kanai and Balai, His brother;
Now, once more, in Nadia,
As Gaur and Nitai do you appear,
Hiding the shapes that then you wore.
In Braja's pastures running freely,
Once you frolicked; now, for play,
You roll on the ground in Nadia,
Chanting aloud Lord Hari's name.
Laughing, shouting, once you played
At Braja with your cowherd friends;
And now you chant Lord Hari's name.
O Gaur, how cleverly you hide
The dark-blue form you wore at Braja!
But your slanting eyes betray you.
Through the blessing of your name
The sinner is set free, they say;
And so my soul is filled with hope.
Now with eager heart I hasten
To your feet: Lord! I implore you,
Keep me safe within their shadow.
You redeemed Jagai and Madhai,
Wretched sinners though they were;
I pray you, do the same for me.
I have heard that you embrace
All men as brothers, even the outcaste,
Whispering in the ears of all
Lord Hari's life-renewing name.
Late at night M. sat alone in the nahabat. The sky, the river, the garden, the steeples of
the temples; the trees, and the Panchavati were flooded with moonlight. Deep silence
reigned everywhere, broken only by the melodious murmuring of the Ganges. M. was
meditating on Sri Ramakrishna.
375At three o'clock in the morning M. left his seat. He proceeded toward the Panchavati as
Sri Ramakrishna had suggested. He did not care for the nahabat any more and resolved
to stay in the hut in the Panchavati.
Suddenly he heard a distant sound, as if someone were wailing piteously, "Oh, where art
Thou, Brother Madhusudana?" The light of the full moon streamed through the thick
foliage of the Panchavati, and as he proceeded he saw at a distance one of the Master's
disciples sitting alone in the grove, crying helplessly, "Oh, where art Thou, Brother
Madhusudana?"
Silently M. watched him.

Story of Prahlada
M. had been staying at Dakshineswar with Sri Ramakrishna. The Master was sitting in
his room, listening to the life of Prahlada, which Ramlal was reading from the
Bhaktamala. M. was sitting on the floor. Rākhāl, Lātu, and Harish were also in the
room, and Hazra was on the verandah. While listening to the story of Prahlada's love for
God, Sri Ramakrishna went into an ecstatic mood.
Hiranyakasipu, the king of the demons and father of Prahlada, had put his son to endless
torture to divert the boy's mind from the love of God. But through divine grace all the
king's attempts to kill Prahlada were ineffective. At last God appeared, assuming the
form of Nrisimha, the Man-lion, and killed Hiranyakasipu. The gods were frightened at
the rage and roaring of the Man-lion and thought that the destruction of the world was
imminent.
They sent Prahlada to pacify the Deity. The boy sang a hymn to Him in words of love,
and the Man-lion, moved by affection, licked Prahlada's body.
Still in an ecstatic mood, the Master said, "Ah! Ah! What love for the devotee!" The
Master went into deep samādhi. He sat there motionless. A tear-drop could be seen at
the corner of each of his eyes.
Master admonishes M.
The Master came down to the plane of the sense world and spoke to M., expressing his
abhorrence for those who, while practising spiritual discipline, enjoyed sex-life.
MASTER: "Aren't you ashamed of yourself? You have children, and still you enjoy
intercourse with your wife. Don't you hate yourself for thus leading an animal life? Don't
you hate yourself for dallying with a body which contains only blood, phlegm, filth, and
excreta? He who contemplates the Lotus Feet of God looks on even the most beautiful
woman as mere ash from the cremation ground. To enjoy a body which will not last and
which consists of such impure ingredients as intestines, bile, flesh, and bone! Aren't you
ashamed of yourself?"
M. sat there silently, hanging his head in shame.
376MASTER: "A man who has tasted even a drop of God's ecstatic love looks on 'woman and
gold' as most insignificant. He who has tasted syrup made from sugar candy regards a
drink made from treacle as a mere trifle. One gradually obtains that love for God if one
but prays to Him with a yearning heart and always chants His name and glories."
The Master was in an ecstasy of love. He began to dance about the room and sing:
Who is singing Hari's name upon the sacred Ganges' bank?
Is it Nitai that has come, the giver of heavenly love?
It was ten o'clock in the morning. Ramlal had finished the daily worship in the Kāli
temple. The Master went to the temple accompanied by M. Entering the shrine, the
Master sat before the image. He offered a flower or two at the feet of the Divine
Mother. Then he put a flower on his own head and began to meditate. He sang a song
to the Divine Mother:
Thy name, I have heard, O Consort of Śiva, is the destroyer of
our fear,
And so on Thee I cast my burden: Save me! Save me, O kindly
Mother!
Sri Ramakrishna returned from the Kāli temple and sat on the southeast verandah of his
room. He ate some refreshments which had been offered at the temple, and the
devotees also received a share.
Rākhāl sat by the Master and read about Lord Erskine from Self-Help by Smiles.
MASTER (to M.): "What does the book say?"
M: "It says that Lord Erskine performed his duty without desiring any result for himself.
Disinterested duty."
MASTER: "That is very good. But the characteristic of a man of Perfect Knowledge is
that he doesn't keep a single book with him. He carries all his Knowledge on the tip of
his tongue. There's the instance of Sukadeva. Books-I mean the scriptures-contain a
mixture of sand and sugar. The sādhu takes the sugar, leaving aside the sand. He
takes only the essence."
Vaishnavcharan, the musician, arrived and sang a few devotional songs.
M. spent the night in the nahabat.
Sunday, December 16, 1883
Sri Ramakrishna was seated with M. on the semicircular porch of his room at about ten
o'clock in the morning. The fragrance of gardenias, jasmines, oleanders, roses, and
other flowers filled the air. The Master was singing looking at M:
377Thou must save me, sweetest Mother! Unto Thee I come for
refuge,
Helpless as a bird imprisoned in a cage.
I have done unnumbered wrongs, and aimlessly I roam about,
Misled by maya's spell, bereft of wisdom's light,
Comfortless as a mother cow whose calf has wandered far
away.
MASTER: "But why? Why should I live like a 'bird imprisoned in a cage'? Fie! For shame!"
As the Master said these words he went into an ecstatic mood. His body became
motionless and his mind stopped functioning; tears streamed down his cheeks. After a
while he said, "O Mother, make me like Sita, completely forgetful of everything-body and
limbs-, totally unconscious of hands, feet, and sense-organs-only the one thought in her
mind, 'Where is Rāma?' "
Was the Master inspired by the ideal of Sita to teach M. the yearning that a devotee
should feel for God? Sita's very life was centred in Rāma. Completely absorbed in the
thought of Rāma, Sita forgot even the body, which is so dear to all.
At four o'clock in the afternoon Mr. Mukherji, a relative of Prankrishna, arrived in the
company of a brahmin well versed in the scriptures.
MUKHERJI: "I am very happy to meet you, sir."
MASTER: "God dwells in all beings. He is the gold in all. In some places it is more
clearly manifest than in others. God dwells in the worldly-minded, no doubt, but He is
hidden there, like gold under deep layers of clay."
MUKHERJI: "Sir, what is the difference between worldly and other-worldly things?"
Brahman and the world
MASTER: "While striving for the realization of God, the aspirant has to practise
renunciation, applying the logic of 'Neti, neti'-'Not this, not this', But after attaining the
vision of God, he realizes that God alone has become all things.
"At one time Rāma was overpowered by the spirit of renunciation. Dasaratha, worried at
this, went to the sageVasishtha and begged him to persuade Rāma not to give up the
world. The sage came to Rāma and found him in a gloomy mood. The fire of intense
renunciation had been raging in the Prince's mind. Vasishtha said: 'Rāma, why should
You renounce the world? Is the world outside God? Reason with me.' Rāma realized that
the world had evolved from the Supreme Brahman. So, He said nothing.
"Buttermilk is made from the same substance as butter. One who realizes this knows
that butter goes with buttermilk and buttermilk with butter. After separating the butter
with great effort-that is to say, after attaining Brahmajnana-you will realize that as long
as butter exists, buttermilk also must exist. Wherever there is butter there must be
378buttermilk as well. As long as one feels that Brahman exists, one must also be aware
that the universe, living beings, and the twenty-four cosmic principles exist as well.
Nature of Brahman
"What Brahman is cannot be described in words. Everything has been polluted, like food
that has touched the tongue-that is, everything has been described in words. But no
one has been able to describe Brahman. It is therefore unpolluted. I said this to
Vidyasagar and he was delighted.
"But the Knowledge of Brahman cannot be realized if the aspirant is worldly-minded
even in the slightest degree. He succeeds in acquiring this Knowledge only when his
mind is totally free from 'woman and gold'. Parvati once said to Her father, 'Father, seek
the company of holy men if you want the Knowledge of Brahman.' "
Addressing Mr. Mukherji, Sri Ramakrishna said: "You are rich, and still you call on God.
That is very good indeed. It is said in the Gitā that those who fall from the path of yoga
are born in their next birth as devotees of God in rich families."
Mr. Mukherji quoted the line from the Gitā.
MASTER: "God, if He so desires, can keep a Jnāni in the world too. The world and all
living beings have been created by His will. But He is self-willed."
MUKHERJI (with a smile): "How can God have any will? Does He lack anything?"
MASTER (with a smile): "What's wrong in that? Water is water whether it is still or in
waves. The snake is a snake whether it is coiled up motionless or wriggles along. A
man is the same man whether sitting still or engaged in action.
"How can you eliminate from the Reality the universe and its living beings? If you do
that, It will lack Its full weight. You cannot find out the total weight of the bel-fruit if
you eliminate the seeds and shell.
"Brahman is unattached. One finds good and bad smells in the air, but the air itself is
untainted. Brahman and Śakti are identical. It is the Primordial Power that has become
the world and all living beings."
MUKHERJI: "Why does one deviate from the path of yoga?"
MASTER: "As the saying goes: 'In my mother's womb I was in a state of yoga; coming
into the world, I have eaten its clay. The midwife has cut one shackle, the navel cord;
but how shall I cut the shackle of maya?'
"Woman and gold"
"Maya is nothing but 'woman' and 'gold'. A man attains yoga when he has freed his
mind from these two. The Self-the Supreme Self-is the magnet; the individual self is the
needle. The individual self experiences the state of yoga when it is attracted by the
379Supreme Self to Itself. But the magnet cannot attract the needle if the needle is covered
with clay; it can draw the needle only when the clay is removed. The clay of 'woman'
and 'gold' must be removed."
MUKHERJI: "How can one remove it?"
MASTER: "Weep for God with a longing heart. Tears shed for Him will wash away the
clay. When you have thus freed yourself from impurity, you will be attracted by the
magnet. Only then will you attain yoga."
MUKHERJI: "Priceless words!"
MASTER: "If a man is able to weep for God, he will see Him. He will go into samādhi.
Perfection in yoga is samādhi. A man achieves kumbhaka without any yogic exercise if
he but weeps for God. The next stage is samādhi.
"There is another method -that of meditation. In the Sahasrara, Śiva manifests Himself
in a special manner. The aspirant should meditate on Him. The body is like a tray; the
mind and buddhi are like water. The Sun of Satchidananda is reflected in this water.
Meditating on the reflected sun, one sees the Real Sun through the grace of God.
"But the worldly man must constantly live in the company of holy men. It is necessary
for all, even for sannyasis. But it is especially necessary for the householder. His
disease has become chronic because he has to live constantly in the midst of 'woman
and gold'."
MUKHERJI: "Yes, sir. The disease has indeed become chronic"
MASTER: "Give God the power of attorney. Let Him do whatever He wants. Be like a
kitten and cry to Him with a fervent heart. The mother cat puts the kitten wherever she
wants to. The kitten doesn't know anything. It is left sometimes on the bed and
sometimes near the hearth."
MUKHERJI: "It is good to read sacred books like the Gitā."
MASTER: "But what will you gain by mere reading? Some have heard of milk, some have
seen it, and there are some, besides, who have drunk it. God can indeed be seen; what
is more, one can talk to Him.
Different stages of spiritual progress
"The first stage is that of the beginner. He studies and hears. Second is the stage of
the struggling aspirant. He prays to God, meditates on Him, and sings His name and
glories. The third stage is that of the perfect soul. He has seen God, realized Him
directly and immediately in his inner Consciousness. Last is the stage of the supremely
perfect, like Chaitanya. Such a devotee establishes a definite relationship with God,
looking on Him as his Son or Beloved."
380M., Rākhāl, Jogin, Lātu, and the other devotees were entranced by these words of divine
realization.
Mr. Mukherji and his friend were taking leave of the Master. After saluting him, they
stood up. The Master also stood up to show them courtesy.
MUKHERJI (smiling): "That you should stand up or sit down!"
MASTER (smiling): "But what's the harm? Water is water whether it is placid or in
waves. I am like a cast-off leaf in the wind. The wind blows that leaf wherever it lists. I
am the machine and God is its Operator."
Mr. Mukherji and his friend left the room. M. thought: "According to the Vedānta all is
like a dream. Are all these-the ego, the universe, and the living beings-unreal then?"
M. had studied a little of the Vedānta. He also had read the German philosophers, such
as Kant and Hegel, whose writings are only a faint echo of the Vedānta. But Sri
Ramakrishna did not arrive at his conclusions by reasoning, as do ordinary scholars. It
was the Divine Mother of the Universe who revealed the Truth to him. These were the
thoughts that passed through M.'s mind.
A little later Sri Ramakrishna and M. were conversing on the porch west of the Master's
room. No one else was there. It was a late winter afternoon, and the sun had not yet
gone below the horizon.
Is the world unreal?
M: "Is the world unreal?"
MASTER: "Why should it be unreal? What you are asking is a matter for philosophical
discussion.
"In the beginning, when a man reasons following the Vedantic method of 'Not this, not
this', he realizes that Brahman is not the living beings, not the universe, not the twenty-
four cosmic principles. All these things become like dreams to him. Then comes the
affirmation of what has been denied, and he feels that God Himself has become the
universe and all living beings.
"Suppose you are climbing to the roof by the stairs. As long as you are aware of the
roof, you are also aware of the stairs. He who is aware of the high is also aware of the
low. But after reaching the roof you realize that the stairs are made of the same
materials-brick, lime, and brick-dust-as the roof.
"Further, I have given the illustration of the bel-fruit.
unchangeability belong to one and the same Reality.
Both changeability and
"The ego cannot be done away with. As long as 'I-consciousness' exists, living beings
and the universe must also exist. After realizing God, one sees that, it is He Himself who
381has become the universe and the living beings. But one cannot realize this by mere
reasoning.
"Śiva has two states of mind. First, the state of samādhi, when He is transfixed in the
Great Yoga. He is then Ātmārāma, satisfied in the Self. Second, the state when He
descends from samādhi and keeps a trace of ego. Then He dances about, chanting,
'Rāma, Rāma!'"
Did the Master describe Śiva to hint at his own state of mind?
It was evening. Sri Ramakrishna was meditating on the Divine Mother and chanting Her
holy name. The devotees also went off to solitary places and meditate on their Chosen
Ideals. Evening worship began at the temple garden in the shrines of Kāli, Radha-
Krishna, and Śiva.
It was the second day of the dark fortnight of the moon. Soon the moon rose in the sky,
bathing temples, trees, flowers, and the rippling surface of the Ganges in its light. The
Master was sitting on the couch and M. on the floor. The conversation turned to the
Vedānta.
MASTER (to M.): "Why should the universe be unreal? That is a speculation of the
philosophers. After realizing God, one sees that it is God Himself who has become the
universe and all living beings.
Divine Mother is the Universal Consciousness
"The Divine Mother revealed to me in the Kāli temple that it was She who had become
everything. She showed me that everything was full of Consciousness. The Image was
Consciousness, the altar was Consciousness, the water-vessels were Consciousness, the
door-sill was Consciousness, the marble floor was Consciousness-all was Consciousness.
"I found everything inside the room soaked, as it were, in Bliss-the Bliss of
Satchidananda. I saw a wicked man in front of the Kāli temple; but in him also I saw the
Power of the Divine Mother vibrating.
"That was why I fed a cat with the food that was to be offered to the Divine Mother. I
clearly perceived that the Divine Mother Herself had become everything-even the cat.
The manager of the temple garden wrote to Mathur Babu saying that I was feeding the
cat with the offering intended for the Divine Mother. But Mathur Babu had insight into
the state of my mind. He wrote back to the manager: 'Let him do whatever he likes.
You must not say anything to him.'
"After realizing God, one sees all this aright-that it is He who has become the universe,
living beings, and the twenty-four cosmic principles. But what remains when God
completely effaces the ego cannot be described in words. As Ramprasad said in one of
his songs, 'Then alone will you know whether you are good or I am good!' I get into
even that state now and then.
382"A man sees a thing in one way through reasoning and in an altogether different way
when God Himself shows it to him."
Monday, December 17, 1883
It was about eight o'clock in the morning. Sri Ramakrishna was in his room with M.,
when Dr. Madhu arrived and sat down beside the Master on the small couch. He was an
elderly man and full of wit. He used to visit the Master when the latter felt indisposed.
MASTER: "The whole thing, in a nutshell is that one must develop ecstatic love for
Satchidananda. What kind of love? How should one love God? Gauri used to say that
one must become like Sita to understand Rāma; like Bhagavati, the Divine Mother, to
understand Bhagavan, Śiva. One must practise austerity, as Bhagavati did, in order to
attain Śiva. One must cultivate the attitude of Prakriti in order to realize Purusha-the
attitude of a friend, a handmaid, or a mother.
"I saw Sita in a vision. I found that her entire mind was concentrated on Rāma. She
was totally indifferent to everything-her hands, her feet, her clothes, her jewels. It
seemed that Rāma had filled every bit of her life and she could not remain alive without
Rāma."
M: "Yes, sir. She was mad with love for Rāma."
MASTER: "Mad! That's the word. One must become mad with love in order to realize
God. But that love is not possible if the mind dwells on 'woman and gold'. Sex-life with
a woman! What happiness is there in that? The realization of God gives ten million times
more happiness. Gauri used to say that when a man attains ecstatic love of God all the
pores of the skin, even the roots of the hair, become like so many sexual organs, and in
every pore the aspirant enjoys the happiness of communion with the Ātman.
"One must call on God with a longing heart. One must learn from the guru how God can
be realized. Only if the guru himself has attained Perfect Knowledge can he show the
way.
"A man, gets rid of all desires when he has Perfect Knowledge. He becomes like a child
five years old. Sages like Dattatreya and Jadabharata had the nature of a child."
M: "One hears about them. But there were many others like them that the world doesn't
hear about."
MASTER: "Yes. The Jnāni gets rid of all desire if any is left, it does not hurt him. At the
touch of the philosopher's stone the sword is transformed into gold. Then that sword
cannot do any killing. Just so, the Jnāni keeps only a semblance of anger and passion.
They are anger and passion only in name and cannot injure him."
383M: "Yes, sir. The Jnāni goes beyond the three gunas, as you say. He is not under the
control of any of the gunas-sattva, rajas, or tamas. All these three are so many robbers,
as it were."
MASTER: "Yes, one must assimilate that."
M: "In this world there are perhaps not more than three or four men of Perfect
Knowledge."
MASTER: "Why do you say that? One sees many holy men and sannyasis in the
monasteries of upper India."
M: "Well, I too can become a sannyasi like one of those."
The Master fixed his gaze on M. and said, "By renouncing everything?"
M: "What can a man achieve unless he gets rid of maya? What will a man gain by merely
being a sannyasi, if he cannot subdue maya?"
Both remained silent a few minutes.
M: "Sir, what is the nature of the divine love transcending the three gunas?"
MASTER: "Attaining that love, the devotee sees everything full of Spirit and
Consciousness. To him 'Krishna is Consciousness, and His sacred Abode is also
Consciousness'. The devotee, too, is Consciousness. Everything is Consciousness. Very
few people attain such love."
DR. MADHU: "The love transcending the three gunas means, in other words, that the
devotee is not under the control of any of the gunas."
MASTER (smiling): "Yes, that's it. He becomes like a child five years old, not under the
control of any of the gunas."
The Master was resting after his noon meal. Mani Mallick arrived and saluted him. Sri
Ramakrishna remained lying on the couch and said a word or two to Mani.
MANI: "I hear you visited Keshab Sen."
MASTER: "Yes. How is he now?"
MANI: "He hasn't recovered to any extent from his illness."
MASTER: "I found him to be very rajasic. I had to wait a long time before I could see
him."
The Master sat up on the couch and continued his conversation with the devotees.
384MASTER (to M.): "I became mad for Rāma. I used to walk about carrying an image of
Ramlala given to me by a monk. I bathed it, fed it, and laid it down to sleep. I carried it
wherever I went. I became mad for Ramlala."
