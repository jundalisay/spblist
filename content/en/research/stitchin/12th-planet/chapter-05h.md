The tale of Etana informs us that, seeking a shem, Etana had to communicate with an Eagle inside a pit. A seal depiction shows a winged, tall structure (a launch tower?) above which an eagle flies off. (Fig. 78)

What or who was the Eagle who took Etana to the distant heavens?

We cannot help associating the ancient text with the message beamed to Earth
in July 1969 by Neil Armstrong, commander of the Apollo 11 spacecraft: "Houston!
Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed!"

He was reporting the first landing by Man on the Moon. "Tranquility Base" was the site of the landing; Eagle was the name of the lunar module that separated
from the spacecraft and took the two astronauts inside it to the Moon (and then
back to their mother craft). When the lunar module first separated to start its own
flight in Moon orbit, the astronauts told Mission Control in Houston: "The Eagle
has wings."

But "Eagle" could also denote the astronauts who manned the spacecraft. On
the Apollo 11 mission, "Eagle" was also the symbol of the astronauts themselves,
worn as an emblem on their suits. Just as in the Etana tale, they, too, were
"Eagles" who could fly, speak, and communicate. (Fig. 79)


How would an ancient artist have depicted the pilots of the skyships of the
gods? Would he have depicted them, by some chance, as eagles?
That is exactly what we have found. An Assyrian seal engraving from circa 1500
B.C. shows two "eagle-men" saluting a shem! (Fig. 80)

Numerous depictions of such "Eagles"—the scholars call them "bird-men"—have
been found. Most depictions show them flanking the Tree of Life, as if to stress
that they, in their shem's, provided the link with the Heavenly Abode where the
Bread of Life and Water of Life were to be found. Indeed, the usual depiction of the
Eagles showed them holding in one hand the Fruit of Life and in the other the
Water of Life, in full conformity with the tales of Adapa, Etana, and Gilgamesh.
(Fig. 81)

The many depictions of the Eagles clearly show that they were not monstrous
"bird-men," but anthropomorphic beings wearing costumes or uniforms that gave
them the appearance of eagles.

The Hittite tale concerning the god Telepinu, who had vanished, reported that
"the great gods and the lesser gods began to search for Telepinu" and "Shamash
sent out a swift Eagle" to find him.

In the Book of Exodus, God is reported to have reminded the Children of Israel,
"I have carried you upon the wings of Eagles, and have brought you unto me,"
confirming, it seems, that the way to reach the Divine Abode was upon the wings
of Eagles—just as the tale of Etana relates. Numerous biblical verses, as a matter
of fact, describe the Deity as a winged being. Boaz welcomed Ruth into the
Judaean community as "coming under the wings" of the God Yahweh. The
Psalmist sought security "under the shadow of thy wings" and described the
descent of the Lord from the heavens. "He mounted a Cberub and went flying; He
soared upon windy wings." Analyzing the similarities between the biblical El
(employed as a title or generic term for the Deity) and the Canaanite El, S.
Langdon (Semitic Mythology) showed that both were depicted, in text and on coins,
as winged gods.

The Mesopotamian texts invariably present Utu/Shamash as the god in charge
of the landing place of the shem's and of the Eagles. And like his subordinates he
was sometimes shown wearing the full regalia of an Eagle's costume. (Fig. 82)

In such a capacity, he could grant to kings the privilege of "flying on the wings
of birds" and of "rising from the lower heavens to the lofty ones." And when he was
launched aloft in a fiery rocket, it was he "who stretched over unknown distances,
for countless hours." Appropriately, "his net was the Earth, his trap the distant
skies."

The Sumerian terminology for objects connected with celestial travel was not
limited to the me's that the gods put on or the mu's that were their cone-shaped
"chariots."

Sumerian texts describing Sippar relate that it had a central part, hidden and
protected by mighty walls. Within those walls stood the Temple of Utu, "a house
which is like a house of the Heavens." In an inner courtyard of the temple, also
protected by high walls, stood "erected upwards, the mighty APIN" ("an object that
plows through," according to the translators).
A drawing found at the temple mound of Anu at Uruk depicts such an object.
We would have been hard put a few decades ago to guess what this object was;
but now we readily recognize it as a multistage space rocket at the top of which
rests the conical mu, or command cabin. (Fig. 83)

A Multistage Space Rocket

The evidence that the gods of Sumer possessed not just "flying chambers" for
roaming Earth's skies but space-going multistage rocket ships also emerges from
the examination of texts describing the sacred objects at Utu's temple at Sippar.
We are told that witnesses at Sumer's supreme court were required to take the
oath in an inner courtyard, standing by a gateway through which they could see
and face three "divine objects." These were named "the golden sphere" (the crew's
cabin?), the GIR, and the alikmahrati—a term that literally meant "advancer that
makes vessel go," or what we would call a motor, an engine.

What emerges here is a reference to a three-part rocket ship, with the cabin or
command module at the top end, the engines at the bottom end, and the gir in the
center. The latter is a term that has been used extensively in connection with
space flight. The guards Gilgamesh encountered at the entrance to the landing
place of Shamash were called gir-men. In the temple of Ninurta, the sacred or
most guarded inner area was called the GIRSU ("where the gir is sprung up").
Gir, it is generally acknowledged, was a term used to describe a sharp-edged
object. A close look at the pictorial sign for gir provides a better understanding of
the term's "divine" nature; for what we see is a long, arrow-shaped object, divided
into several parts or compartments:

That the mu could hover in Earth's skies on its own, or fly over Earth's lands
when attached to a gir, or become the command module atop a multistage apin is
testimony to the engineering ingenuity of the gods of Sumer, the Gods of Heaven
and Earth.
A review of the Sumerian pictographs and ideograms leaves no doubt that
whoever drew those signs was familiar with the shapes and purposes of rockets
with tails of billowing fire, missile-like vehicles, and celestial "cabins."
KA.GIR ("rocket's mouth") showed a fin-equipped gir, or rocket, inside a
shaftlike underground enclosure.
ESH ("Divine Abode"), the chamber or command module of a space vehicle.
ZIK ("ascend"), a command module taking off?
Finally, let us look at the pictographic sign for "gods" in Sumerian. The term
was a two-syllable word: DIN.GIR. We have already seen what the symbol for GIR
was: a two-stage rocket with fins. DIN, the first syllable, meant "righteous," "pure,"
"bright." Put together, then, DIN.GIR as "gods" or "divine beings" conveyed the
meaning "the righteous ones of the bright, pointed objects" or, more explicitly, "the
pure ones of the blazing rockets."
The pictographic sign for din was this: , easily bringing to mind a
powerful jet engine spewing flames from the end part, and a front part that is
puzzlingly open. But the puzzle turns to amazement if we "spell" dingir by
combining the two pictographs. The tail of the finlike gir fits perfectly into the
opening in the front of din! (Figs. 84, 85)
The astounding result is a picture of a rocket-propelled spaceship, with a
landing craft docked into it perfectly—just as the lunar module was docked with
the Apollo 11 spaceship! It is indeed a three-stage vehicle, with each part fitting
neatly into the other: the thrust portion containing the engines, the midsection
containing supplies and equipment, and the cylindrical "sky chamber" housing the
people named dingir—the gods of antiquity, the astronauts of millennia ago.
Can there be any doubt that the ancient peoples, in calling their deities "Gods of
Heaven and Earth," meant literally that they were people from elsewhere who had
come to Earth from the heavens?
The evidence thus far submitted regarding the ancient gods and their vehicles
should leave no further doubt that they were once indeed living beings of flesh and
blood, people who literally came down to Earth from the heavens.
Even the ancient compilers of the Old Testament—who dedicated the Bible to a
single God—found it necessary to acknowledge the presence upon Earth in early
times of such divine beings.
The enigmatic section—a horror of translators and theologians alike—forms the
beginning of Chapter 6 of Genesis. It is interposed between the review of the
spread of Mankind through the generations following Adam and the story of the
divine disenchantment with Mankind that preceded the Deluge. It states—
unequivocally—that, at that time,
the sons of the gods
saw the daughters of man, that they were good;
and they took them for wives,
of all which they chose.
The implications of these verses, and the parallels to the Sumerian tales of gods
and their sons and grandsons, and of semidivine offspring resulting from
cohabitation between gods and mortals, mount further as we continue to read the
biblical verses:
The Nefilim were upon the Earth,
in those days and thereafter too,
when the sons of the gods
cohabited with the daughters of the Adam,
and they bore children unto them.
They were the mighty ones of Eternity—
The People of the shem.
The above is not a traditional translation. For a long time, the expression "The
Nefilim were upon the Earth" has been translated as "There were giants upon the
earth"; but recent translators, recognizing the error, have simply resorted to
leaving the Hebrew term Nefilim intact in the translation. The verse "The people of
the shem," as one could expect, has been taken to mean "the people who have a
name:' and, thus, "the people of renown." But as we have already established, the
term shem must be taken in its original meaning—a rocket, a rocket ship.
What, then, does the term Nefilim mean? Stemming from the Semitic root NFL
("to be cast down"), it means exactly what it says: It means those who were cast
down upon Earth!

Contemporary theologians and biblical scholars have tended to avoid the
troublesome verses, either by explaining them away allegorically or simply by
ignoring them altogether. But Jewish writings of the time of the Second Temple did
recognize in these verses the echoes of ancient traditions of "fallen angels." Some
of the early scholarly works even mentioned the names of these divine beings "who
fell from Heaven and were on Earth in those days": Sham-Hazzai ("shem's
lookout"), Uzza ("mighty") and Uzi-El ("God's might").

Malbim, a noted Jewish biblical commentator of the nineteenth century, recognized these ancient roots and explained that "in ancient times the rulers of countries were the sons of the deities who arrived upon the Earth from the Heavens, and ruled the Earth, and married wives from among the daughters of
Man; and their offspring included heroes and mighty ones, princes and
sovereigns." These stories, Malbim said, were of the pagan gods, "sons of the
deities, who in earliest times fell down from the Heavens upon the Earth … that is
why they called themselves 'Nefilim:' i.e. Those Who Fell Down."
Irrespective of the theological implications, the literal and original meaning of
the verses cannot be escaped: The sons of the gods who came to Earth from the
heavens were the Nefilim.


The Nefilim were the People of the Shem—the People of the Rocket Ships.
Henceforward, we shall call them by their biblical name.
