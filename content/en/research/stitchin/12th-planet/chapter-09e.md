This terminology, by which the descriptive names of the planets were related to their role in the space voyage of the Nefilim, conforms with the names and epithets in the lists of the Seven Shu Planets. 

As if to confirm our conclusions, the inscription stating that this was the route of Enlil appears below a row of 7 dots—the Seven Planets that stretch from Pluto to Earth.

Not surprisingly, the remaining 4 celestial bodies, those in the "zone of
confusion," are shown separately, beyond Earth's northern skies and the celestial
band.

Evidence that this is a space map and flight manual shows up in all the other
undamaged segments, too. 

Continuing in a counterclockwise direction, the legible portion of the next segment bears the inscription: "take take take cast cast cast cast complete complete." The third segment, where a portion of the unusual elliptical shape is seen, the legible inscriptions include "kakkab SIB.ZI.AN.NA … envoy of AN.NA … deity ISH.TAR," and the intriguing sentence: "Deity NI.NI supervisor of descent."

In the 4th segment, which contains what appear to be directions on how to establish one's destination according to a certain group of stars, the descending line is specifically identified as the skyline: The word sky is repeated 11 times under the line.

Does this segment represent a flight phase nearer Earth, nearer the landing spot? This might indeed be the import of the legend over the horizontal line: "hills hills hills hills top top top top city city city city." The inscription in the center says: "kakkab MASH.TAB.BA [Gemini] whose encounter is fixed; kakkab SIB.ZI.AN.NA [Jupiter] provides knowledge."

If, as appears to be the case, the segments are arranged in an approach sequence, then one can almost share the excitement of the Nefilim as they approached Earth's spaceport. The next segment, again identifying the descending line as "sky sky sky," also announces:


our light our light our light
change change change change
observe path and high ground
… flat land …

The horizontal line contains, for the first time, figures:


rocket rocket
rocket rise glide
40 40 40
40 40 20 22 22

The upper line of the next segment no longer states: "sky sky"; instead, it calls
for "channel channel 100 100 100 100 100 100 100." A pattern is discernible in
this largely damaged segment. Along one of the lines the inscription says:
"Ashshur," which can mean "He who sees" or "seeing."

The seventh segment is too damaged to add to our examination; the few
discernible syllables mean "distant distant … sight sight," and the instructional
words are "press down." 

The eighth and final segment, however, is almost complete. Directional lines, arrows, and inscriptions mark a path between 2 planets. Instructions to "pile up mountain mountain," show four sets of crosses, inscribed twice "fuel water grain" and twice "vapor water grain."

Was this a segment dealing with preparations for the flight toward Earth, or one dealing with stocking up for the return flight to rejoin the 12th Planet? The latter may have been the case, for the line with the sharp arrow pointing toward the landing site on Earth has at its other end another "arrow" pointing in the opposite direction, and bearing the legend "Return." (Fig. 124)


When Ea arranged for Anu's emissary to "make Adapa take the road to Heaven"
and Anu discovered the ruse, he demanded to know:
Why did Ea, to a worthless human
the plan of Heaven-Earth disclose–
rendering him distinguished,
making a Shem for him?


In the planisphere we have just deciphered, we indeed see such a route map, a
"plan of Heaven-Earth." In sign language and in words, the Nefilim have sketched
for us the route from their planet to ours.



Otherwise inexplicable texts dealing with celestial distances also make sense if we read them in terms of space travel from the 12th Planet. One such text,  found in the ruins of Nippur and believed to be some 4,000 years old, is now kept at the Hilprecht Collection at the University of Jena, in Germany. O. Neugebauer  (The Exact Sciences in Antiquity) established that the tablet was undoubtedly a copy "from an original composition which was older"; it gives ratios of celestial distances starting from the Moon to Earth and then through space to six other planets.

The second part of the text appears to have provided the mathematical formulas
for solving whatever the interplanetary problem was, stating (according to some
readings):

40 4 20 6 40 x 9 is 6 40
13 kasbu 10 ush mul SHU.PA
eli mul GIR sud
40 4 20 6 40 X 7 is 511 6 40
10 kasbu 11 ush 6½ gar 2 u mul GIR tab
eli mul SHU.PA sud

There has never been full agreement among scholars as to the correct reading of the measurement units in this part of the text (a new reading was suggested to us in a letter from Dr. J. Oelsner, custodian of the Hilprecht Collection at Jena). 

The second part of the text measured distances from SHU.PA (Pluto).

Only the Nefilim, traversing the planetary orbits, could have worked out these
formulas; only they needed such data.

Taking into consideration that their own planet and their target, Earth, were  both in continuous motion, the Nefilim had to aim their craft not at where Earth was at launch time but where it would be at arrival time. One can safely assume that the Nefilim worked out their trajectories very much as modern scientists map the missions to the Moon and to other planets.

The spacecraft of the Nefilim was probably launched from the 12th Planet in the direction of the 12th Planet's own orbit, but well ahead of its arrival in Earth's vicinity. Based on these and a myriad other factors, two alternative trajectories for the spacecraft were worked out for us by Amnon Sitchin, doctor of aeronautics and engineering. 

The first trajectory would call for the launching of the spacecraft from the 12th Planet before it reached its apogee (the point farthest out). With few power needs, the spaceship would actually not so much change course as slow down.

While the 12th Planet (a space vehicle, too, even though a huge one) continued on its vast elliptical orbit, the spaceship would follow a much shorter elliptical course and reach Earth far ahead of the 12th Planet. This alternative may have offered the Nefilim both advantages and disadvantages.

The full span of 3,600 Earth years, which applied to tenures of office and other
activities of the Nefilim upon Earth, suggests that they might have preferred the
second alternative, that of a short trip and a stay in Earth's skies coinciding with
the arrival of the 12th Planet itself. 

This would have called for the launching of the spaceship (C) when the 12th Planet was about midway on its course back from the apogee. With the planet's own speed rapidly increasing, the spaceship required strong engines to overtake its home planet and reach Earth (D) a few
Earth years ahead of the 12th Planet. (Fig. 125)

<!-- Based on complex technical data, as well as hints in Mesopotamian texts, it
appears that  -->

The Nefilim adopted for their Earth missions the same approach NASA adopted for the Moon missions: When the principal spaceship neared the target planet (Earth), it went into orbit around that planet without actually landing. Instead, a smaller craft was released from the mother ship and performed the actual landing.

As difficult as accurate landings were, the departures from Earth must have
been even trickier. The landing craft had to rejoin its mother ship, which then had to fire up its engines and accelerate to extremely high speeds, for it had to catch up with the 12th Planet, which by then was passing its perigee between Mars and Jupiter at its top orbital speed.

Dr. Sitchin has calculated that there were 3 points in the spaceship's orbit of Earth that lent themselves to a thrust toward the 12th Planet. 

The 3 alternatives offered the Nefilim a choice of catching up with the 12th Planet within 1.1 to 1.6 Earth years. 

Suitable terrain, guidance from Earth, and perfect coordination with the home planet were required for successful arrivals, landings, takeoffs, and departures from Earth.

The Nefilim met all these requirements.
