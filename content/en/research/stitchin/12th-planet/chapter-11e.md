The Nefilim relied on their scientific knowledge to achieve their mission.

<!-- —to mine on Earth its
desired minerals, and ship the ingots back to the 12th Planet—with such a
small number of hands? -->

It was there that Enki's full value becomes clear—the reason for his, rather than Enlil's, being the first to
land, the reason for his assignment to the Abzu.

A famous seal now on exhibit at the Louvre Museum shows Ea with his familiar flowing waters, except that the waters seem to emanate from, or be filtered through, a series of laboratory flasks. (Fig. 147) 

Such an ancient interpretation of Ea's association with waters raises the possibility that the original hope of the Nefilim was to obtain their minerals from the sea. 

The oceans' waters do contain vast quantities of gold and other vital minerals, but so greatly diluted that highly sophisticated and cheap techniques are needed to justify such "water mining." 

The sea beds contain immense quantities of minerals in the form of plum-sized nodules—available if only one could reach deep down and scoop them up.

The ancient texts refer repeatedly to a type of ship used by the gods called elippu tebiti ("sunken ship"—what we now call a submarine). We have seen the "fish-men" that were assigned to Ea.

Is this evidence of efforts to dive to the depths of the oceans and retrieve their mineral riches? The Land of the Mines, we have noted, was earlier called A.RA.LI.–"place of the waters of the shiny lodes." 

This could mean a land where gold could be river-panned; it could also refer to efforts to obtain gold from the seas.

If these were the plans of the Nefilim, they apparently came to naught. For, soon after they had established their first settlements, the few hundred Anunnaki were given an unexpected and most arduous task: to go down into the depths of the African soil and mine the needed minerals there.

Depictions that have been found on cylinder seals show gods at what appear to be mine entrances or mine shafts; one shows Ea in a land where Gibil is aboveground and another god toils underground, on his hands and knees. (Fig.
148)

In later times, Babylonian and Assyrian texts disclose, men—young and old—were sentenced to hard labor in the mines of the Lower World. Working in darkness and eating dust as food, they were doomed never to return to their homeland. 

This is why the Sumerian epithet for the land—KUR.NU.GI.A—acquired the interpretation "land of no return"; its literal meaning was "land where godswho-work, in deep tunnels pile up [the ores]." 

For the time when the Nefilim settled Earth, all the ancient sources attest, was a time when Man was not yet on Earth; and in the absence of Mankind, the few Anunnaki had to toil in the mines. Ishtar, on her descent to the Lower World, described the toiling Anunnaki as eating food mixed with clay and drinking water fouled with dust.

Against this background, we can fully understand a long epic text named (after its opening verse, as was the custom), "When the gods, like men, bore the work." 

Piecing together many fragments of both Babylonian and Assyrian versions, W.G. Lambert and A. R. Millard (Atra-Hasis: The Babylonian Story of the Flood) were able to present a continuous text. They reached the conclusion that it was based on earlier Sumerian versions, and possibly on even earlier oral traditions about the arrival of the gods on Earth, the creation of Man, and his destruction by the Deluge.

While many of the verses hold only literary value to their translators, we find them highly significant, for they corroborate our findings and conclusions in the preceding chapters. They also explain the circumstances that led to the mutiny of
the Anunnaki.

The story begins in the time when only the gods lived on Earth:


{{< q >}}
When the gods, like men,
bore the work and suffered the toil—
the toil of the gods was great,
the work was heavy,
the distress was much.
At that time, the epic relates, the chief deities had already divided the
commands among themselves.
Anu, father of the Anunnaki, was their Heavenly King;
Their Lord Chancellor was the warrior Enlil.
Their Chief Officer was Ninurta,
And their Sheriff was Ennugi.
The gods had clasped hands together,
Had cast lots and divided.
Anu had gone up to heaven,
[Left] the earth to his subjects.
The seas, enclosed as with a loop,
They had given to Enki, the prince.
{{< /q >}}


Seven cities were established, with 7 Anunnaki as city commanders. 


"The 7 Great Anunnaki were making the lesser gods suffer the work."

Of all their chores, digging was the most common, the most arduous, and the most abhorred. The lesser gods dug up the river beds to make them navigable; they dug canals for irrigation; and they dug in the Apsu to bring up the
minerals of Earth. 

Though they undoubtedly had some sophisticated tools—the texts spoke of the "silver axe which shines as the day," even underground—the work was too exacting. 

For a long time—for forty "periods," to be exact—the Anunnaki "suffered the toil"; and then they cried: No more!
They were complaining, backbiting,
Grumbling in the excavations.

The occasion for the mutiny appears to have been a visit by Enlil to the mining area. Seizing the opportunity, the Anunnaki said to one another:

{{< q >}}
Let us confront our … the Chief Officer,
That he may relieve us of our heavy work.
The king of the gods, the hero Enlil,
Let us unnerve him in his dwelling!
A leader or organizer of the mutiny was soon found. He was the "chief officer of
old time," who must have held a grudge against the current chief officer. His
name, regrettably, is broken off; but his inciting address is quite clear:
"Now, proclaim war;
Let us combine hostilities and battle."
The gods heeded his words.
They set fire to their tools;
Fire to their axes they put;
They troubled the god of mining in the tunnels;
They held [him] as they went
to the gate of the hero Enlil.
{{< /q >}}

The drama and tension of the unfolding events are brought to life by the ancient
poet:

{{< q >}}
It was night, half-way through the watch.
His house was surrounded—
but the god, Enlil, did not know.
Kalkal [then] observed it, was disturbed.
He slid the bolt and watched…
Kalkal roused Nusku;
they listened to the noise of…
Nusku roused his lord—
he got him out of his bed, [saying];
"My lord, your house is surrounded,
battle has come right up to your gate."
Enlil's first reaction was to take up arms against the mutineers. But Nusku, his
chancellor, advised a Council of the Gods:
"Transmit a message that Anu come down;
Have Enki brought to your presence."
He transmitted and Anu was carried down;
Enki was also brought to his presence.
With the great Anunnaki present,
Enlil arose … opened his mouth
And addressed the great gods.
Taking the mutiny personally, Enlil demanded to know:
"Is it against me that this is being done?
Must I engage in hostilities … ?
What did my very own eyes see?
That battle has come right up to my gate!"
{{< /q >}}

Anu suggested that an inquiry be undertaken. Armed with the authority of Anu and the other commanders, Nusku went to the encamped mutineers. "Who is the instigator of battle?" he asked. "Who is the provoker of hostilities?"

The Anunnaki stood together:

{{< q >}}
"Every single one of us gods has war declared!
We have our … in the excavations;
Excessive toil has killed us,
Our work was heavy, the distress much."
{{< /q >}}

When Enlil heard Nusku's report of these grievances, "his tears flowed." He presented an ultimatum: either the leader of the mutineers be executed or he would resign. 

"Take the office away, take back your power," he told Anu, "and I will to you in heaven ascend." 

But Anu, who came down from Heaven, sided with the Anunnaki:

{{< q >}}
"What are we accusing them of?
Their work was heavy, their distress was much!
Every day…
The lamentation was heavy, we could hear the complaint."
Encouraged by his father's words, Ea also "opened his mouth" and repeated
Anu's summation. But he had a solution to offer: Let a lulu, a "Primitive Worker,"
be created!
"While the Birth Goddess is present,
Let her create a Primitive Worker;
Let him bear the yoke…
Let him carry the toil of the gods!"
The suggestion that a "Primitive Worker" be created so that he could take over
the burden of work of the Anunnaki was readily accepted. Unanimously, the gods
voted to create "The Worker." "Man shall be his name," they said:
They summoned and asked the goddess,
The midwife of the gods, the wise Mami,
[and said to her:]
"You are the Birth Goddess, create Workers!
Create a Primitive Worker,
That he may bear the yoke!
Let him bear the yoke assigned by Enlil,
Let The Worker carry the toil of the gods!"
{{< /q >}}

Mami, the Mother of the Gods, said she would need the help of Ea, "with whom skill lies." In the House of Shimti, a hospital-like place, the gods were waiting. Ea helped prepare the mixture from which the Mother Goddess proceeded to fashion "Man." 

Birth goddesses were present. The Mother Goddess went on working while incantations were constantly recited. Then she shouted in triumph: 

"I have created! My hands have made it!"

She "summoned the Anunnaki, the Great Gods … she opened her mouth, addressed the Great Gods":

{{< q >}}
"You commanded me a task
I have completed it…
I have removed your heavy work
I have imposed your toil on The Worker, 'Man.'
You raised a cry for a Worker-kind:
I have loosed the yoke,
I have provided your freedom."
{{< /q >}}

The Anunnaki received her announcement enthusiastically. "They ran together and kissed her feet." From then on it would be the Primitive Worker—Man—"who will bear the yoke."


The Nefilim, having arrived on Earth to set up their colonies, had created their
own brand of slavery, not with slaves imported from another continent, but with
Primitive Workers fashioned by the Nefilim themselves.
A mutiny of the gods had led to the creation of Man.
