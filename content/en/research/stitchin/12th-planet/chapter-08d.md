I think that these pre-Diluvial rulers were Nefilim who came to Earth from the 12th Planet. This is why their "reign" on Earth is related to the orbital period of the 12th Planet. 

The periods of such tenure or Kingship would last from the time of a landing to the time of a takeoff; as one commander arrived from the 12th Planet, the other's time came up. 

Since the landings and takeoffs must have been related to the 12th Planet's approach to Earth, the command tenures could only have been measured in these orbital periods, of shar's.

How could the Nefilim, having landed on Earth, remain in command here for 28,800 or 36,000 years?

Our "year" is the time it takes Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun. 

<!-- Because life developed on Earth when it was already orbiting the Sun, life on Earth is patterned by this length of orbit.  -->

(Even a more minor orbit time, like that of the Moon, or the day-night cycle is powerful enough to affect almost all life on Earth.) 

We live so many years because our biological clocks are geared to so many Earth orbits around the Sun.

Life on another planet would be "timed" to the cycles of that planet. 

If the trajectory of the 12th Planet around the Sun were so extended that one orbit was completed in the same time it takes Earth to complete 100 orbits, then one year of the Nefilim would equal 100 of our years. 

If their orbit took 1,000 times longer than ours, then 1,000 Earth years would equal only one Nefilim year.

What if their orbit around the sun lasted 3,600 Earth years?

Then 3,600 of our years would amount to only 1 year in their calendar, and also only one year in their lifetime. 

The tenures of Kingship reported by the Sumerians and Berossus would thus be neither "legendary" nor fantastic: They would have lasted 5-10 Nefilim years.

Mankind's march to civilization—through the intervention of the Nefilim—passed through 3 stages which were separated by periods of 3,600 years:

1. The Neolithic period (circa 11,000 BC) 
2. The pottery phase (circa 7400 B.C.)
3. The sudden Sumerian civilization (circa 3800 BC).

The Nefilim periodically reviewed Mankind's progress, since they could meet in assembly each time the 12th Planet neared Earth.

Many scholars (for example, Heinrich Zimmern in The Babylonian and Hebrew Genesis) have pointed out that the Old Testament also carried traditions of preDiluvial chieftains, or forefathers, and that the line from Adam to Noah (the hero of the Deluge) listed ten such rulers. 

Putting the situation prior to the Deluge in perspective, the Book of Genesis (Chapter 6) described the divine disenchantment with Mankind. "And it repented the Lord that he had made Man on Earth … and the Lord said: I will destroy Man whom I had created."


{{< q >}}
And the Lord said:
My spirit shall not shield Man forever;
having erred, he is but flesh.
And his days were one hundred and twenty years.
{{< /q >}}


Generations of scholars have read the verse "And his days shall be 120 years" as God's granting a life span of 120 years to Man. 

But this just does not make sense. 

If the text dealt with God's intent to destroy Mankind, why would he in the same breath offer Man long life? 

No sooner had the Deluge subsided than Noah lived far longer than the supposed limit of 120 years, as did his descendants Shem (600), Arpakhshad (438), Shelah (433), and so on.

In seeking to apply the span of 120 years to Man, the scholars ignore the fact that the biblical language employs not the future tense—"His days shall be"—but the past tense—"And his days were one hundred and twenty years." 

Whose time span is referred to here?


Our conclusion is that the count of 120 years was meant to apply to the Deity. 

Setting a momentous event in its proper time perspective is a common feature of the Sumerian and Babylonian epic texts. 

The "Epic of Creation" opens with the words Enuma elish ("when on high"). The story of the encounter of the god Enlil and the goddess Ninlil is placed at the time "when man had not yet been created," and so on.

The language and purpose of Chapter 6 of Genesis were geared to the same purpose—to put the momentous events of the great Flood in their proper time perspective. The very first word of the very first verse of Chapter 6 is when:


{{< q >}}
When the Earthlings began to increase in number and daughters were born unto them.

This, the narrative continues, was the time when
The sons of the gods
saw the daughters of the Earthling
that they were compatible;
and they took unto themselves
wives of whichever they chose.
It was the time when
The Nefilim were upon the land
in those days, and thereafter too;
when the sons of the gods
cohabited with the Earthling's daughters
and they conceived.
They were the Mighty Ones who are of Olam,
the People of the Shem.
It was then, in those days, at that time that Man was about to be wiped off the
face of the Earth by the Flood.
When exactly was that?
{{< /q >}}


Verse 3 tells us unequivocally: when his, the Deity's count, was 120 years. 

120 "years," not of Man and not of Earth, but as counted by the mighty ones, the "People of the Rockets," the Nefilim. And their year was the shar—3,600 Earth years.


This clarifies Genesis 6.. It also shows how the verses match the Sumerian information: 120 shars, 432,000 Earth years, had passed between the Nefilim's first landing on Earth and the Deluge. 

Based on our estimates of when the Deluge occurred, we place the first landing of the Nefilim on Earth circa 450,000 years ago.
