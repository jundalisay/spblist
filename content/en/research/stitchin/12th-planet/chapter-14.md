<!-- What was this Deluge, whose raging waters swept over Earth?
Some explain the Flood in terms of the annual inundations of the Tigris–
Euphrates plain. One such inundation, it is surmised, must have been
particularly severe. Fields and cities, men and beasts were swept away by the
rising waters; and primitive peoples, seeing the event as a punishment by the
gods, began to propagate the legend of a Deluge.

In one of his books, Excavations at Ur, Sir Leonard Woolley relates how, in 1929,
as the work on the Royal Cemetery at Ur was drawing to a close, the workmen
sank a small shaft at a nearby mound, digging through a mass of broken pottery
and crumbled brick. Three feet down, they reached a level of hard-packed mud—
usually soil marking the point where civilization had started. But could the
millennia of urban life have left only three feet of archaeological strata? Sir
Leonard directed the workmen to dig farther. They went down another three feet,
then another five. They still brought up "virgin soil"—mud with no traces of
human habitation. But after digging through eleven feet of silted, dry mud, the
workmen reached a stratum containing pieces of broken green pottery and flint
instruments. An earlier civilization had been buried under eleven feet of mud!
Sir Leonard jumped into the pit and examined the excavation. He called in his
aides, seeking their opinions. No one had a plausible theory. Then Sir Leonard's
wife remarked almost casually, "Well, of course, it's the Floodl"
Other archaeological delegations to Mesopotamia, however, cast doubt on this
marvelous intuition. The stratum of mud containing no traces of habitation did
indicate flooding; but while the deposits of Ur and al-'Ubaid suggested flooding
sometime between 3500 and 4000 B.C., a similar deposit uncovered later at Kish
was estimated to have occurred circa 2800 B.C. The same date (2800 B.C.) was
estimated for mud strata found at Erech and at Shuruppak, the city of the
Sumerian Noah. At Nineveh, excavators found, at a depth of some sixty feet, no
less than thirteen alternate strata of mud and riverine sand, dating from 4000 to
3000 B.C.

Most scholars, therefore, believe that what Woolley found were traces of diverse
local floodings—frequent occurrences in Mesopotamia, where occasional torrential
rains and the swelling of the two great rivers and their frequent course changes
cause such havoc. All the varying mud strata, scholars have concluded, were not
the comprehensive calamity, the monumental prehistoric event that the Deluge
must have been.

The Old Testament is a masterpiece of literary brevity and precision. The words
are always well chosen to convey precise meanings; the verses are to the point;
their order is purposeful; their length is no more than is absolutely needed. It is
noteworthy that the whole story from Creation through the expulsion of Adam and
Eve from the Garden of Eden is told in eighty verses. The complete record of Adam
and his line, even when told separately for Cain and his line and Seth, Enosh, and
their line, is managed in fifty-eight verses. But the story of the Great Flood merited
no less than eighty-seven verses. It was, by any editorial standard, a "major story."
No mere local event, it was a catastrophe affecting the whole of Earth, the whole of
Mankind. The Mesopotamian texts clearly state that the "four corners of the Earth"
were affected.

As such, it was a crucial point in the prehistory of Mesopotamia. There were the
events and the cities and the people before the Deluge, and the events and cities
and people after the Deluge. There were all the deeds of the gods and the Kingship
that they lowered from Heaven before the Great Flood, and the course of godly and
human events when Kingship was lowered again to Earth after the Great Flood.  -->

The Flood was the great time divider.

Not only the comprehensive king lists but also texts relating to individual kings
and their ancestries made mention of the Deluge. One, for example, pertaining to
Ur-Ninurta, recalled the Deluge as an event remote in time:

On that day, on that remote day,
On that night, on that remote night,
In that year, in that remote year—
When the Deluge had taken place.


The Assyrian king Ashurbanipal was a patron of the sciences. He amassed the huge library of clay tablets in Nineveh. He was able to read "stone inscriptions from before the Deluge." 

An Akkadian text dealing with names and their origins explains that it lists names "of kings from after the Deluge." 

A king was exalted as "of seed preserved from before the Deluge." Various scientific texts quoted as their source "the olden sages, from before the Deluge."


What was the ordeal suffered by Mankind, in respect to which Noah was named "Respite" with the hope that his birth signaled an end to the hardships?

What was the "secret" the gods swore to keep, and of whose disclosure Enki was accused? 

Why was the launching of a space vehicle from Sippar the signal to Utnapishtim to enter and seal the ark? 

Where were the gods while the waters covered even the highest mountains? 

Why did they so cherish the roasted meat sacrifice offered by Noah/Utnapishtim?

The Deluge was not a premeditated punishment brought about by the gods at their exclusive will.

The Deluge was a predictable event, it was an unavoidable one, a natural calamity in which the gods played not an active but a passive role. 

<!-- We will also show that the secret the gods swore to
was a conspiracy against Mankind—to withhold from the Earthlings the
information they had regarding the coming avalanche of water so that, while the
Nefilim saved themselves, Mankind should perish. -->

Much of our greatly increased knowledge of the Deluge and the events preceding it comes from the text "When the gods as men." 


### Atra-Hasis

The hero of the Deluge is called Atra-Hasis.

The Epic of Gilgamesh has a Deluge segment where Enki called Utnapishtim "the exceedingly wise"—which in Akkadian is atra-hasis.

<!-- Scholars theorized that the texts in which Atra-Hasis is the hero might be parts of an earlier, Sumerian Deluge story.  -->

In time, enough Babylonian, Assyrian, Canaanite, and even original Sumerian tablets were discovered to enable a major reassembly of the Atra-Hasis epic -- a masterful work credited to W. G. Lambert and A. R. Millard (Atra-Hasis: The Babylonian Story of the Flood).

After describing the hard work of the Anunnaki, their mutiny, and the ensuing creation of the Primitive Worker, the epic relates how Man began to procreate and multiply. 


{{< q >}}
**In time, Mankind began to upset Enlil.**

The land extended, the people multiplied;
In the land like wild bulls they lay.
The god got disturbed by their conjugations;
The god Enlil heard their pronouncements,
and said to the great gods:

"Oppressive have become the pronouncements of Mankind;
Their conjugations deprive me of sleep."
{{< /q >}}


Enlil then ordered a punishment by calling for the decimation of Mankind through pestilence and sicknesses.

<!-- We would expect to read now of the coming Deluge. But not so.
Surprisingly, Enlil did not even mention a Deluge or any similar watery ordeal.
Instead,  -->

The Akkadian and Assyrian versions of the epic speak of "aches, dizziness, chills, fever" as well as "disease, sickness, plague, and pestilence" afflicting Mankind and its livestock following Enlil's call for punishment. 

But Enlil's scheme did not work. 

<!-- The "one who was exceedingly wise"— -->

Atra-Hasis—happened to be especially close to Enki.

<!-- Telling his own story in some of the versions, he
says, "I am Atra-Hasis; I lived in the temple of Ea my lord."  -->

Atra-Hasis alterted Lord Enki and appealed to him to undo his brother Enlil's plan:


{{< q >}}
"Ea, O Lord, Mankind groans;
the anger of the gods consumes the land.
Yet it is thou who hast created us!
Let there cease the aches, the dizziness,
the chills, the fever!"
{{< /q >}}


Until more pieces of the broken-off tablets are found, we shall not know what Enki's advice was. He said of something, "…let there appear in the land." Whatever it was, it worked.

Soon thereafter, Enlil complained bitterly to the gods that "the people have not diminished; they are more numerous than before!"

He then proceeded to outline the extermination of Mankind through starvation.


{{< q a="Enlil" >}}
Let supplies be cut off from the people; in their bellies, let fruit and vegetables be wanting!" The famine was to be achieved through natural forces, by a lack of rain and failing irrigation.

Let the rains of the rain god be withheld from above;

Below, let the waters not rise from their sources.

Let the wind blow and parch the ground;
Let the clouds thicken, but hold back the downpour. 
{{< /q >}}


Even the sources of seafood were to disappear: 


Enki was ordered to "draw the bolt, bar the sea," and "guard" its food away from the people.

Soon the drought began to spread devastation.


{{< q >}}
From above, the heat was not…

Below, the waters did not rise from their sources. he womb of the earth did not bear; Vegetation did not sprout… The black fields turned white; The broad plain was choked with salt.
