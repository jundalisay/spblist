Calling Atra-Hasis to the temple, he made him stay behind a screen. 

Then Enki pretended to speak not to his devout Earthling but to the wall. "Reed screen,"
he said,

Pay attention to my instructions.
On all the habitations, over the cities,
a storm will sweep.
The destruction of Mankind's seed it will be…
This is the final ruling,
the word of the Assembly of the gods,
the word spoken by Anu, Enlil and Ninhursag.

This subterfuge explains Enki's later contention, when the survival of Noah/Utnapishtim was discovered, that he had not broken his oath—that the "exceedingly wise" (atra-hasis) Earthling had found out the secret of the Deluge all by himself, by correctly interpreting the signs.

Pertinent seal depictions show an attendant holding the screen while Ea—as the Serpent God—reveals the secret to Atra-Hasis. (Fig. 160)



### Ea Reveals the Secret

Enki's advice was to build a waterborne vessel, giving precise instruction with the boat's measurements, and construction.

<!--  but when the latter said, "I have never built a boat ... draw for me a design on the ground
that I may see," Enki provided him with -->

<!-- Steeped in Bible stories, we imagine this "ark" as a very large boat, with decks and superstructures. 

But the biblical term—teba—stems from the root "sunken," and it must be concluded that Enki
instructed his Noah to construct a submersible boat—a submarine. -->

The Akkadian text quotes Enki as calling for a boat "roofed over and below," hermetically sealed with "tough pitch." 

There were to be no decks, no openings, "so that the sun shall not see inside," It was to be a boat "like an Apsu boat," a ulili; it is the very term used nowadays in Hebrew ( oleleth) to denote a submarine.

Enki said: "Let the boat be a MA.GUR.GUR". It means a boat that can turn and tumble.

Only such a boat could have survived an overpowering avalanche of waters.

The Atra-Hasis version, like the others, reiterates that although the calamity was only 7 days away, the people were unaware of its approach. 

Atra-Hasis used the excuse that the "Apsu vessel" was being built so that he could leave for Enki's abode and perhaps thereby avert Enlil's anger. 

This was readily accepted, for things were really bad. 

Noah's father had hoped that his birth signaled the end of a long time of suffering. The people's problem was a drought. But now they would perish by water.

Aware of the impending calamity, the Nefilim went skyward. 

<!-- took steps to save their own skins. With Earth about to be engulfed by water, they could go in only one direction for protection: skyward. -->

When the storm that preceded the Deluge began to blow, they took to their shuttlecraft, and remained in Earth orbit until the waters began to subside.

The day of the Deluge was the day the gods fled from Earth.

The sign for which Utnapishtim had to watch, upon which he was to join all others in the ark and seal it, was this:

{{< q >}}
When Shamash, who orders a trembling at dusk, will shower down a rain of eruptions
board thou the ship, batten up the entrance!
{{< /q >}}


Shamash was in charge of the spaceport at Sippar. 

Enki instructed Utnapishtim to watch for the first sign of space launchings at Sippar. Shuruppak, where Utnapishtim lived, was only 18 beru (some 180 kilometers, or 112 miles) south of Sippar. Since the launchings were to take place at dusk, there would be no problem in seeing the "rain of
eruptions" that the rising rocket ships would "shower down."

The Nefilim were prepared for, but scared of the Deluge. "The noise of the Deluge … set the gods trembling." 

But when the moment to leave Earth arrived, the gods, "shrinking back, ascended to the
heavens of Anu." 

The Assyrian version of Atra-Hasis speaks of the gods using rukub ilani ("chariot of the gods") to escape from Earth. "The Anunnaki lifted up," their rocket-ships, like torches, "setting the land ablaze with their glare." 

Orbiting Earth, the Nefilim saw a scene of destruction that affected them deeply.

The Gilgamesh texts tell us that, as the storm grew in intensity, not only "could no one see his fellow," but "neither could the people be recognized from the heavens."

Crammed into their spacecraft, the gods strained to see what was happening on the planet from which they had just blasted off.

{{< q >}}
The gods cowered like dogs, crouched against the outer wall.
Ishtar cried out like a woman in travail:
"The olden days are alas turned to clay."…
The Anunnaki gods weep with her. The gods, all humbled, sit and weep; their lips drawn tight … one and all.
{{< /q >}}


The Atra-Hasis texts echo the same theme. The gods, fleeing, were watching the destruction at the same time. But the situation within their own vessels was not very encouraging, either.

They were divided among several spaceships.

Tablet III of the Atra-Hasis epic describes the conditions on board one where some of the Anunnaki shared accommodations with the Mother Goddess.

{{< q >}}
The Anunnaki, great gods, were sitting in thirst, in hunger…
Ninti wept and spent her emotion; she wept and eased her feelings.
The gods wept with her for the land. She was overcome with grief, she thirsted for beer.
Where she sat, the gods sat weeping; crouching like sheep at a trough.

Their lips were feverish of thirst, they were suffering cramp from hunger.
The Mother Goddess herself, Ninhursag, was shocked by the utter devastation.
She bewailed what she was seeing:
The Goddess saw and she wept…
her lips were covered with feverishness....
"My creatures have become like flies—they filled the rivers like dragonflies, their fatherhood was taken by the rolling sea."
Could she save her own life while Mankind, which she helped create, was dying? Could she really leave the Earth, she asked aloud—"Shall I ascend up to Heaven, to reside in the House of Offerings,
where Anu, the Lord, had ordered to go?"
{{< /q >}}


The orders to the Nefilim become clear: Abandon Earth, "ascend up to Heaven."

It was a time when Niburu was nearest Earth, within the asteroid belt ("Heaven"), as evidenced by the fact that Anu was able to attend personally the crucial conferences shortly before the Deluge.

Enlil and Ninurta—accompanied perhaps by the elite of the Anunnaki, those who had manned Nippur—were in one spacecraft, planning, to rejoin the main spaceship. But the other gods were not so determined. 

Forced to abandon Earth, they suddenly realized how attached they had become to it and its inhabitants. 

In one craft, Ninhursag and her group of Anunnaki debated the merits of the orders given by Anu. 

In another, Ishtar cried out: "The olden days, alas, are turned into clay"; the Anunnaki who were in her craft "wept with her." 

Enki was in another spacecraft, or else he would have disclosed to the others that he had managed to save the seed of Mankind. He had other reasons to feel less gloomy, for the evidence suggests that he had also planned the encounter at Ararat.

The ancient versions appear to imply that the ark was simply carried to the region of Ararat by the torrential waves; and a "south-storm" would indeed drive the boat northward.

But the Mesopotamian texts reiterate that AtraHasis/Utnapishtim took along with him a "Boatman" named Puzur-Amurri ("westerner who knows the secrets"). 

To him the Mesopotamian Noah "handed over the structure, together with its contents," as soon as the storm started. 

Why was an experienced navigator needed, unless it was to bring the ark to a specific
destination?

The Nefilim used the peaks of Ararat as landmarks from the very beginning. As the highest peaks in that part of the world, they could be expected to reappear first from under the mantle of water. 

<!-- Since Enki, "The Wise One, the All-Knowing," certainly could figure that much out, we can surmise that
he had instructed his servant to guide the ark toward Ararat, planning the
encounter from the very beginning. -->
