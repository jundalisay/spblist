A tablet elaborates the meaning of the various epithets by relating them to the passage of the planet at the site of the battle with Tiamat—a passage that causes the Deluge!

The text begins by announcing that, for all its might and size, the planet ("the hero") nevertheless orbits the Sun. The Deluge was the "weapon" of this planet.


{{< q >}}
His weapon is the Deluge;
God whose Weapon brings death to the wicked.
Supreme, Supreme, Anointed ...
Who like the Sun, the lands crosses;
The Sun, his god, he frightens.
{{< /q >}}


Calling out the "first name" of the planet—which, unfortunately, is illegible—the text describes the passage near Jupiter, toward the site of the battle with Tiamat:

{{< q >}}
First Name: …
Who the circular band hammered together;
Who the Occupier split in two, poured her out.
Lord, who at Akiti time
Within Tiamat's battle place reposes…
Whose seed are the sons of Babylon;
Who by the planet Jupiter cannot be distracted;
Who by his glow shall create.
{{< /q >}}


Coming closer, the 12th Planet is called SHILIG.LU.DIG ("powerful leader of the joyous planets"). It is now nearest to Mars: "By the brilliance of the god [planet] Anu god [planet] Lahmu [Mars] is clothed." Then it loosed the Deluge upon the Earth:

This is the name of the Lord
Who from the second month to the month Addar
The waters had summoned forth.

<!-- The text's elaboration of the two names offers remarkable calendarial information.  -->

The 12th Planet* passed Jupiter and neared Earth "at Akiti time," when the Mesopotamian New Year began. By the second month it was closest to Mars. Then, "from the second month to the month Addar" (the 12th month), it loosed the Deluge on Earth.

{{< n n="This was actually comet Encke" >}}

This is in perfect harmony with the biblical account, which states that "the fountains of the great deep burst open" on the seventeenth day of the second month.

The ark came to rest on Ararat in the seventh month; other dry land was visible in the tenth month; and the Deluge was over in the 12th month—for it was on "the first day of the first month" of the following year that Noah opened the ark's hatch.

Shifting to the second phase of the Deluge, when the waters began to subside,
the text calls the planet SHUL.PA.KUN.E.


Hero, Supervising Lord,
Who collects together the waters;
Who by gushing waters
The righteous and the wicked cleanses;
Who in the twin-peaked mountain
Arrested the…
…fish, river, river; the flooding rested.
In the mountainland, on a tree, a bird rested.
Day which … said.



The flooding had ceased, the ark was "arrested" on the twin-peaked mountain; the rivers began to flow again from the mountaintops and carry the waters back to the oceans; fish were seen; a bird was sent out from the ark. The ordeal was over.


When the savant shall call out: "Flooding!"—
It is the god Nibiru ["Planet of Crossing"];
It is the Hero, the planet with four heads.
The god whose weapon is the Flooding Storm,
shall turn back;
To his resting place he shall lower himself.
(The receding planet, the text asserts, then recrossed the path of Saturn in the
month of Ululu, the sixth month of the year.)

The Old Testament frequently refers to the time when the Lord caused Earth to be covered by the waters of the deep. The 29th Psalm describes the "calling" as well as the "return" of the "great waters" by the Lord:

Unto the Lord, ye sons of the gods,
Give glory, acknowledge might…
The sound of the Lord is upon the waters;
The God of glory, the Lord,
Thundereth upon the great waters…
The Lord's sound is powerful,
The Lord's sound is majestic;
The Lord's sound breaketh the cedars…
He makes [Mount] Lebanon dance as a calf,
[Mount] Sirion leap like a young bull.
The Lord's sound strikes fiery flames;
The Lord's sound shaketh the desert…
The Lord to the Deluge [said]: "Return!"
The Lord, as king, is enthroned forever.

In the magnificent Psalm 77-"Aloud to God I Cry"—the Psalmist recalls the Lord's appearance and disappearance in earlier times:

I have calculated the Olden Days,
The years of Olam…
I shall recall the Lord's deeds,
Remember thy wonders in antiquity…
Thine course, a Lord, is determined;
No god is as great as the Lord…
The waters saw thee, O Lord, and shuddered;
Thine splitting sparks went forth.
The sound of thine thunder was rolling;
Lightnings lit up the world;
The Earth was agitated and it quaked.
[Then] in the waters was thy course,
Thine paths in the deep waters;
And thine footsteps were gone, unknown.

Psalm 104 exalted the deeds of the Celestial Lord. It recalled when the oceans overran the continents and were made to go back:

Thou didst fix the Earth in constancy,
For ever and ever to be unmoved.
With the oceans, as with garment, thou coveredst it;
Above the mountains did the water stand.
At thy rebuke, the waters fled;
At the sound of thine thunder, they hastened away.
They went upon the mountains, then down to the valleys
Unto the place which thou hast founded for them.
A boundary thou hast set, not to be passed over;
That they turn not again to cover the Earth.
The words of the prophet Amos are even more explicit:
Woe unto you that desire the Day of the Lord;
To what end is it for you?
For the Day of the Lord is darkness and no light...
Turneth morning unto death's shadow,
Maketh the day dark as night;
Calleth forth the waters of the sea
and poureth them upon the face of the Earth.
These, then, were the events that took place "in olden days." The "Day of the
Lord" was the day of the Deluge.


Having landed on Earth, the Nefilim associated the first reigns in the first cities with the zodiacal ages—giving the zodiacs the epithets of the various associated gods. We now find that the text uncovered by Ebeling provided calendarial information not only for men but also for the Nefilim. The Deluge, it informs us, occurred in the "Age of the constellation Lion";

Supreme, Supreme, Anointed;
Lord whose shining crown with terror is laden.
Supreme planet: a seat he has set up
Facing the confined orbit of the red planet [Mars].
Daily within the Lion he is afire;
His light, his bright kingships on the lands pronounces.

We can now also understand an enigmatic verse in the New Year's rituals, stating that it was "the constellation Lion that measured the waters of the deep."

These statements place the time of the Deluge within a definite framework, for though astronomers nowadays cannot precisely ascertain where the Sumerians set the beginning of a zodiacal house, the following timetable for the ages is considered accurate.

60 B.C. to A.D. 2100—Age of Pisces
2220 B.C. to 60 B.C.—Age of Aries
4380 B.C. to 2220 B.C.—Age of Taurus
6540 B.C. to 4380 B.C.—Age of Gemini
8700 B.C. to 6540 B.C.—Age of Cancer
10,860 B.C. to 8700 B.C.—Age of the Lion
If the Deluge occurred in the Age of the Lion, or sometime between 10,860 B.C.
and 8700 B.C., then the date of the Deluge falls well within our timetable:

According to modern science, the last ice age ended abruptly in the southern hemisphere some twelve to thirteen thousand years ago, and in the northern hemisphere one or two thousand years later.

The zodiacal phenomenon of precession offers even more comprehensive corroboration of our conclusions. We concluded earlier that the Nefilim landed on Earth 432,000 years (120 shar's) before the Deluge, in the Age of Pisces. 

In terms of the precessional cycle, 432,000 years comprise sixteen full cycles, or Great Years, and more than halfway through another Great Year, into the "age" of the constellation of the Lion.

We can now reconstruct the complete timetable for the events embraced by our findings.


Years Ago | EVENT
--- | ---
445,000 | The Nefilim, led by Enki, arrive on Earth from Nibiru. Eridu—Earth Station I—is established in southern Mesopotamia.
430,000 | The great ice sheets begin to recede. A hospitable climate in the Near East.
415,000 | Enki moves inland, establishes Larsa.
400,000 | The great interglacial period spreads globally. Enlil arrives on Earth, establishes Nippur as Mission Control Center. Enki establishes sea routes to southern Africa, organizes gold-mining operations.
360,000 | The Nefilim establish Bad-Tibira as their metallurgical center for smelting and refining. Sippar, the spaceport, and other cities of the gods are built.
300,000 | The Anunnaki mutiny. Man—the "Primitive Worker"—is fashioned by Enki and Ninhursag.
250,000 | "Early Homo sapiens" multiply, spread to other continents.
200,000 | Life on Earth regresses during new glacial period.
100,000 | Climate warms again. The sons of the gods take the daughters of Man as wives.
77,000 | Ubartutu/Lamech, a human of divine parentage, assumes the reign in Shuruppak under the patronage of Ninhursag.
75,000 | The "accursation of Earth"—a new ice age—begins. Regressive types of Man roam Earth.
49,000 | The reign of Ziusudra ("Noah"), a "faithful servant" of Enki, begins.*
38,000 | The harsh climatic period of the "seven passings" begins to decimate Mankind. Europe's Neanderthal Man disappears; only Cro-Magnon Man (based in the Near East) survives. Enlil, disenchanted with Mankind, seeks its demise.
13,000 | The Nefilim, aware of the impending tidal wave that will be triggered by the nearing 12th Planet, vow to let Mankind perish. The Deluge sweeps over Earth, abruptly ending the ice age.
