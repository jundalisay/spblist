Forearmed with the clues provided in the Egyptian and Mesopotamian texts, the scholars embarked on excavations of ancient sites in Anatolia's hilly regions. The efforts paid off: 

They found Hittite cities, palaces, royal treasures, royal tombs, temples, religious objects, tools, weapons, art objects. 

Above all, they found many inscriptions—both in a pictographic script and in cuneiform. The biblical Hittites had come to life.

A unique monument bequeathed to us by the ancient Near East is a rock carving outside the ancient Hittite capital (the site is nowadays called Yazilikaya, which in Turkish means "inscribed rock"). 

After passing through gateways and sanctuaries, the ancient worshiper came into an open-air gallery, an opening among a semicircle of rocks, on which all the gods of the Hittites were depicted in procession.

Marching in from the left is a long procession of primarily male deities, clearly organized in "companies" of twelve. At the extreme left, and thus last to march in this amazing parade, are 12 deities who look identical, all carrying the same weapon. (Fig. 25)

The middle group of twelve marchers includes some deities who look older, some who bear diversified weapons, and two who are highlighted by a divine symbol. (Fig. 26)

The third (front) group of 12 is clearly made up of the more important male and female deities. Their weapons and emblems are more varied; four have the divine celestial symbol above them; two are Winged. 

This group also includes nondivine participants: two bulls holding up a globe, and the king of the Hittites, wearing a skull cap and standing under the emblem of the Winged Disk. (Fig. 27)

Marching in from the right were two groups of female deities; the rock carvings are, however, too mutilated to ascertain their full original number. We will probably not be wrong in assuming that they, too, made up two "companies" of 12 each.

The two processions from the left and from the right met at a central panel which clearly depicted Great Gods, for they were all shown elevated, standing atop mountains, animals, birds, or even on the shoulders of divine attendants. (Fig. 28)

Much effort was invested by scholars (for example, E. Laroche, Le Pantheon de Yazilikaya) to determine from the depictions, the hieroglyphic symbols, as well as from partly legible texts and god names that were actually carved on the rocks, the names, titles, and roles of the deities included in the procession. 

The Hittite pantheon, too, was governed by the "Olympian" twelve. The lesser
gods were organized in groups of twelve, and the Great Gods on Earth were
associated with twelve celestial bodies.

That the pantheon was governed by the "sacred number" 12 is made additionally certain by yet another Hittite monument, a masonry shrine found near the present-day Beit-Zehir. It clearly depicts the divine couple, surrounded by 10 other gods—making a total of 12. (Fig. 29)

The archaeological finds showed conclusively that the Hittites worshiped gods that were "of Heaven and Earth," all interrelated and arranged into a genealogical hierarchy. Some were great and "olden" gods who were originally of the heavens. 

Their symbol—which in the Hittite pictographic writing meant "divine" or "heavenly god"—looked like a pair of eye goggles. (Fig. 30) It frequently appeared on round seals as part of a rocket-like object. (Fig. 31)

Other gods were actually present, not merely on Earth but among the Hittites, acting as supreme rulers of the land, appointing the human kings, and instructing the latter in matters of war, treaties, and other international affairs.

Heading the physically present Hittite gods was a deity named Teshub, which meant "wind blower." He was thus what scholars call a Storm God, associated with winds, thunder, and lightning. He was also nicknamed Taru ("bull"). 

Like the Greeks, the Hittites depicted bull worship; like Jupiter after him, Teshub was depicted as the God of Thunder and Lightning, mounted upon a bull. (Fig. 32)

<!-- Illustration:
Teshub, God of Thunder and Lightning -->

Hittite texts, like later Greek legends, relate how their chief deity had to battle a monster to consolidate his supremacy. A text named by the scholars "The Myth of the Slaying of the Dragon" identifies Teshub's adversary as the god Yanka. 

Failing to defeat him in battle, Teshub appealed to the other gods for help, but only one goddess came to his assistance, and disposed of Yanka by getting him drunk at a party.

Recognizing in such tales the origins of the legend of Saint George and the Dragon, scholars refer to the adversary smitten by the "good" god as "the dragon." 

But the fact is that Yanka meant "serpent," and that the ancient peoples depicted the "evil" god as such—as seen in this bas-relief from a Hittite site. (Fig. 33) Zeus, too, as we have shown, battled not a "dragon" but a serpent-god. 

There was deep meaning attached to these ancient traditions of a struggle between a god of winds and a serpent deity. Here, however, we can only stress that
battles among the gods for the divine Kingship were reported in the ancient texts
as events that had unquestionably taken place.

<!-- Illustration:
Evil Serpent-God -->

A long and well-preserved Hittite epic tale, entitled "Kingship in Heaven," deals
with this very subject—the heavenly origin of the gods. The recounter of those
premortal events first called upon twelve "mighty olden gods" to listen to his tale,
and be witnesses to its accuracy:
Let there listen the gods who are in Heaven,
And those who are upon the dark-hued Earth!
Let there listen, the mighty olden gods.

Thus establishing that the gods of old were both of Heaven and upon Earth, the
epic lists the twelve "mighty olden ones," the forebears of the gods; and assuring
their attention, the recounter proceeded to tell how the god who was "king in
Heaven" came to "dark-hued Earth:"

Formerly, in the olden days, Alalu was king in Heaven;
He, Alalu, was seated on the throne.
Mighty Anu, the first among the gods, stood before him,
Bowed at his feet, set the drinking cup in his hand.
For nine counted periods, Alalu was king in Heaven.
In the ninth period, Anu gave battle against Alalu.
Alalu was defeated, he fled before Anu—
He descended to the dark-hued Earth.
Down to the dark-hued Earth he went;
On the throne sat Anu.

The epic thus attributed the arrival of a "king in Heaven" upon Earth to a usurpation of the throne: A god named Alalu was forcefully deposed from his throne (somewhere in the heavens), and, fleeing for his life, "descended to darkhued Earth." 

But that was not the end. The text proceeded to recount how Anu, in turn, was also deposed by a god named Kumarbi (Anu's own brother, by some interpretations).

This epic was:
- written a thousand years before the Greek legends were composed
- the forerunner of the tale of the deposing of Uranus by Cronus and of Cronus by Zeus. 

Even the detail pertaining to the castration of Cronus by Zeus is found in the Hittite text, for that was exactly what Kumarbi did to Anu:

{{< q >}}
For 9 counted periods Anu was king in Heaven;
In the ninth period, Anu had to do battle with Kumarbi.
Anu slipped out of Kumarbi's hold and fled—
Flee did Anu, rising up to the sky.
After him Kumarbi rushed, seized him by his feet;
He pulled him down from the skies.
He bit his loins; and the "Manhood" of Anu
with the insides of Kumarbi combined, fused as bronze.
{{< /q >}}


According to this ancient tale, the battle did not result in a total victory. 

Though emasculated, Anu managed to fly back to his Heavenly Abode, leaving Kumarbi in
control of Earth. 

Meanwhile, Anu's "Manhood" produced several deities within Kumarbi's insides, which he (like Cronus in the Greek legends) was forced to release. One of these was Teshub, the chief Hittite deity.

However, there was to be one more epic battle before Teshub could rule in
peace.

Learning of the appearance of an heir to Anu in Kummiya ("heavenly abode"), Kumarbi devised a plan to "raise a rival to the God of Storms." "Into his hand he took his staff; upon his feet he put the shoes that are swift as winds"; and he went from. his city Ur-Kish to the abode of the Lady of the Great Mountain. 

{{< q >}}
Reaching her,
His desire was aroused;
He slept with Lady Mountain;
His manhood flowed into her.
Five times he took her…
Ten times he took her.
{{< /q >}}


Was Kumarbi simply lustful? 

We have reason to believe that much more was involved. Our guess would be that the succession rules of the gods were such that a son of Kumarbi by the Lady of the Great Mountain could have claimed to be the rightful heir to the Heavenly Throne; and that Kumarbi "took" the goddess five and ten times in order to make sure that she conceived, as indeed she did: she bore a son, whom Kumarbi symbolically named Ulli-Kummi ("suppressor of Kummiya"—
Teshub's abode).

The battle for succession was foreseen by Kumarbi as one that would entail fighting in the heavens. Having destined his son to suppress the incumbents at Kummiya, Kumarbi further proclaimed for his son: 

Let him ascend to Heaven for kingship!
Let him vanquish Kummiya, the beautiful city!
Let him attack the God of Storms
And tear him to pieces, like a mortal!
Let him shoot down all the gods from the sky.

Did the particular battles fought by Teshub upon Earth and in the skies take
place when the Age of Taurus commenced, circa 4000 B.C.? Was it for that reason
that the winner was granted association with the bull? And were the events in any
way connected with the beginning, at the very same time, of the sudden
civilization of Sumer?


The Hittite pantheon and tales of the gods had their roots in Sumer, its civilization, and its gods.

The tale of the challenge to the Divine Throne by Ulli-Kummi continues to relate heroic battles but of an indecisive nature. At one point, the failure of Teshub to defeat his adversary even caused his spouse, Hebat, to attempt suicide. 

Finally, an appeal was made to the gods to mediate the dispute, and an Assembly of the Gods was called. It was led by an "olden god" named Enlil, and another "olden god" named Ea, who was called upon to produce "the old tablets with the words of destiny"—some ancient records that could apparently help settle the dispute regarding the divine succession.

When these records failed to settle the dispute, Enlil advised another battle with
the challenger, but with the help of some very ancient weapons. "Listen, ye olden
gods, ye who know the olden words," Enlil said to his followers:

Open ye the ancient storehouses
Of the fathers and the forefathers!
Bring forth the Olden Copper lance
With which Heaven was separated from Earth;
And let them sever the feet of Ulli-kummi.

Who were these "olden gods"? The answer is obvious, for all of them—Anu, Antu, Enlil, Ninlil, Ea, Ishkur—bear Sumerian names. Even the name of Teshub, as well as the names of other "Hittite" gods, were often written in Sumerian script to denote their identities. Also, some of the places named in the action were those of ancient Sumerian sites.

It dawned on the scholars that the Hittites in fact worshiped a pantheon of Sumerian origins, and that the arena of the tales of the "olden gods" was Sumer. 

This, however, was only part of a much wider discovery. Not only was the Hittite language found to be based on several Indo-European dialects, but it was also found to be subject to substantial Akkadian influence, both in speech and more so in writing. 

Since Akkadian was the international language of the ancient world in the second millennium B.C., its influence on Hittite could somehow be rationalized.

But there was cause for true astonishment when scholars discovered in the course of deciphering Hittite that it extensively employed Sumerian pictographic signs, syllables, and even whole words! 

Moreover, it became obvious that Sumerian was their language of high learning. The Sumerian language, in the words of O. R. Gurney (The Hittites), "was intensively studied at Hattu-Shash [the capital city] and Sumerian-Hittite vocabularies were found there… 

Many of the syllables associated with the cuneiform signs in the Hittite period are really Sumerian words of which the meaning had been forgotten [by the Hittites]… In the
Hittite texts the scribes often replaced common Hittite words by the corresponding
Sumerian or Babylonian word."

Now, when the Hittites reached Babylon sometime after 1600 B.C., the
Sumerians were already long gone from the Near Eastern scene. How was it, then,
that their language, literature, and religion dominated another great kingdom in
another millennium and in another part of Asia?
The bridge, scholars have recently discovered, were a people called the
Hurrians.

Referred to in the Old Testament as the Horites ("free people"), they dominated
the wide area between Sumer and Akkad in Mesopotamia and the Hittite kingdom
in Anatolia. In the north their lands were the ancient "cedar lands" from which
countries near and far obtained their best woods. In the east their centers
embraced the present-day oil fields of Iraq; in one city alone, Nuzi, archaeologists
found not only the usual structures and artifacts but also thousands of legal and
social documents of great value. In the west, the Hurrians' rule and influence
extended to the Mediterranean coast and encompassed such great ancient centers
of trade, industry, and learning as Carchemish and Alalakh.
But the seats of their power, the main centers of the ancient trade routes, and
the sites of the most venerated shrines were within the heartland that was
"between the two rivers," the biblical Naharayim. Their most ancient capital (as yet
undiscovered) was located somewhere on the Khabur River. Their greatest trading
center, on the Balikh River, was the biblical Haran—the city where the family of
the patriarch Abraham sojourned on their way from Ur in southern Mesopotamia
to the Land of Canaan.
Egyptian and Mesopotamian royal documents referred to the Hurrian kingdom
as Mitanni, and dealt with it on an equal footing-a strong power whose influence
spread beyond its immediate borders. The Hittites called their Hurrian neighbors
"Hurri." Some scholars pointed out, however, that the word could also be read
"Har," and (like G. Contenau in La Civilisation des Hittites et des Hurrites du
Mitanni) have raised the possibility that, in the name "Harri," "one sees the name
'Ary' or Aryans for these people."
There is no doubt that the Hurrians were Aryan or Indo-European in origin.
Their inscriptions invoked several deities by their Vedic "Aryan" names, their kings
bore Indo-European names, and their military and cavalry terminology derived
from the Indo-European. B. Hrozny, who in the 1920s led an effort to unravel the
Hittite and Hurrian records, even went so far as to call the Hurrians "the oldest
Hindus."
These Hurrians dominated the Hittites culturally and religiously. The Hittite
mythological texts were found to be of Hurrian provenance, and even epic tales of
prehistoric, semidivine heroes were of Hurrian origin. There is no longer any doubt
that the Hittites acquired their cosmology, their "myths," their gods, and their
pantheon of twelve from the Hurrians.
The triple connection—between Aryan origins, Hittite worship, and the Hurrian
sources of these beliefs-is remarkably well documented in a Hittite prayer by a
woman for the life of her sick husband. Addressing her prayer to the goddess
Hebat, Teshub's spouse, the woman intoned:
Oh goddess of the Rising Disc of Arynna,
My Lady, Mistress of the Hatti Lands,
Queen of Heaven and Earth…
In the Hatti country, thy name is
"Goddess of the Rising Disc of Arynna";
But in the land that thou madest,
In the Cedar Land,
Thou bearest the name "Hebat."
With all that, the culture and religion adopted and transmitted by the Hurrians
were not Indo-European. Even their language was not really Indo-European. There
were undoubtedly Akkadian elements in the Hurrian language, culture, and
traditions. The name of their capital, Washugeni, was a variant of the Semitic
resh-eni ("where the waters begin"). The Tigris River was called Aranzakh, which
(we believe) stemmed from the Akkadian words for "river of the pure cedars." The
gods Shamash and Tashmeturn became the Hurrian Shimiki and Tashimmetish—
and so on.
But since the Akkadian culture and religion were only a development of the
original Sumerian traditions and beliefs, the Hurrians, in fact, absorbed and
transmitted the religion of Sumer. That this was so was also evident from the
frequent use of the original Sumerian divine names, epithets, and writing signs.
The epic tales, it has become clear, were the tales of Sumer; the "dwelling
places" of the olden gods were Sumerian cities; the "olden language" was the
language of Sumer. Even the Hurrian art duplicated Sumerian art—its form, its
themes, and its symbols.
When and how were the Hurrians "mutated" by the Sumerian "gene"?
Evidence suggests that the Hurrians, who were the northern neighbors of
Sumer and Akkad in the second millennium B.C., had actually commingled with
the Sumerians in the previous millennium. It is an established fact that Hurrians
were present and active in Sumer in the third millennium B.C., that they held
important positions in Sumer during its last period of glory, that of the third
dynasty of Ur. There is evidence showing that the Hurrians managed and manned
the garment industry for which Sumer (and especially Ur) was known in antiquity.
The renowned merchants of Ur were probably Hurrians for the most part.
In the thirteenth century B.C., under the pressure of vast migrations and
invasions (including the Israelite thrust from Egypt to Canaan), the Hurrians
retreated to the northeastern portion of their kingdom. Establishing their new
capital near Lake Van, they called their kingdom Urartu ("Ararat"). There they
worshiped a pantheon headed by Tesheba (Teshub), depicting him as a vigorous
god wearing a horned cap and standing upon his cult symbol, the bull. (Fig. 34)
They called their main shrine Bitanu Chouse of Anu") and dedicated themselves to
making their kingdom "the fortress of the valley of Anu."

And Anu, as we shall see, was the Sumerian Father of the Gods.

What about the other avenue by which the tales and worship of the gods
reached Greece—from the eastern shares of the Mediterranean, via Crete and
Cyprus?
The lands that are today Israel, Lebanon, and southern Syria—which formed
the southwestern band of the ancient Fertile Crescent—were then the habitat of
peoples that can be grouped together as the Canaanites. Once again, all that was
known of them until rather recently appeared in references (mostly adverse) in the
Old Testament and scattered Phoenician inscriptions. Archaeologists were only
beginning to understand the Canaanites when two discoveries came to light:
certain Egyptian texts at Luxor and Saqqara, and, much more important,
historical, literary, and religious texts unearthed at a major Canaanite center. The
place, now called Ras Shamra, on the Syrian coast, was the ancient city of Ugarit.
The language of the Ugarit inscriptions, the Canaanite language, was what
scholars call West Semitic, a branch of the group of languages that also includes
the earliest Akkadian and present-day Hebrew. Indeed, anyone who knows Hebrew
well can follow the Canaanite inscriptions with relative ease. The language, literary
style, and terminology are reminiscent of the Old Testament, and the script is the
same as that of Israelite Hebrew.
The pantheon that unfolds from the Canaanite texts bears many similarities to
the later Greek one. At the head of the Canaanite pantheon, too, there was a
supreme deity called El, a word that was both the personal name of the god and
the generic term meaning "lofty deity." He was the final authority in all affairs,
human or divine. Ab Adam ("father of man") was his title; the Kindly, the Merciful
was his epithet. He was the "creator of things created, and the one who alone
could bestow kingship."
The Canaanite texts ("myths" to most scholars) depicted El as a sage, elderly
deity who stayed away from daily affairs. His abode was remote, at the
"headwaters of the two rivers"—the Tigris and Euphrates. There he would sit on
his throne, receive emissaries, and contemplate the problems and disputes the
other gods brought before him.
A stela found in Palestine depicts an elderly deity sitting on a throne and being
served a beverage by a younger deity. The seated deity wears a conical headdress
adorned with horns—a mark of the gods, as we have seen, from prehistoric
times—and the scene is dominated by the symbol of a winged star—the ubiquitous
emblem that we shall increasingly encounter. It is generally accepted by the
scholars that this sculptured relief depicts El, the senior Canaanite deity. (Fig. 35)
Illustration:
El, Senior Canaanite Deity
El, however, was not always an olden lord. One of his epithets was Tor (meaning
"bull"), signifying, scholars believe, his sexual prowess and his role as Father of
the Gods. A Canaanite poem, called "Birth of the Gracious Gods," placed El at the
seashore (probably naked), where two women were completely charmed by the size
of his penis. While a bird was roasting on the beach, El had intercourse with the
two women. Thus were the two gods Shahar ("dawn") and Shalem ("completion" or
"dusk") born.
These were not his only children nor his principal sons (of which he had,
apparently, seven). His principal son was Baal—again the personal name of the
deity, as well as the general term for "lord." As the Greeks did in their tales, the
Canaanites spoke of the challenges by the son to the authority and rule of his
father. Like El his father, Baal was what the scholars call a Storm God, a God of
Thunder and Lightning. A nickname for Baal was Hadad ("sharp one"). His
weapons were the battle-ax and the lightning-spear; his cult animal, like El's, was
the bull, and, like El, he was depicted wearing the conical headdress adorned with
a pair of horns.
Baal was also called Elyon ("supreme"); that is, the acknowledged prince, the
heir apparent. But he had not come by this title without a struggle, first with his
brother Yam ("prince of the sea"), and then with his brother Mot. A long and
touching poem, pieced together from numerous fragmented tablets, begins with
the summoning of the "Master Craftsman" to El's abode "at the sources of the
waters, in the midst of the headwaters of the two rivers":
Through the fields of El he comes
He enters the pavilion of the Father of Years.
At El's feet he bows, falls down,
Prostrates himself, paying homage.
The Master Craftsman is ordered to erect a palace for Yam as the mark of his
rise to power. Emboldened by this, Yam sends his messengers to the assembly of
the gods, to ask for the surrender to him of Baal. Yam instructs his emissaries to
be defiant, and the assembled gods do yield. Even El accepts the new lineup
among his sons. "Ba'al is thy slave, O Yam," he declares.
The supremacy of Yam, however, was short-lived. Armed with two "divine
weapons," Baal struggled with Yam and defeated him—only to be challenged by
Mot (the name meant "smiter"). In this struggle, Baal was soon vanquished; but
his sister Anat refused to accept this demise of Baal as final. "She seized Mot, the
son of El, and with a blade she cleaved him."
The obliteration of Mot led, according to the Canaanite tale, to the miraculous
resurrection of Baal. Scholars have attempted to rationalize the report by
suggesting that the whole tale was only allegorical, representing no more than a
tale of the annual struggle in the Near East between the hot, rainless summers
that dry out the vegetation, and the coming of the rainy season in the autumn,
which revives or "resurrects" the vegetation. But there is no doubt that the
Canaanite tale intended no allegory, that it related what were then believed to be
the true events: how the sons of the chief deity fought among themselves, and how
one of them defied defeat to reappear and become the accepted heir, making El
rejoice:
El, the kindly one, the merciful, rejoices.
His feet on the footstool he sets.
He opens his throat and laughs;
He raises his voice and cries out:
"I shall sit and take my ease,
The soul shall repose in my breast;
For Ba'al the mighty is alive,
For the Prince of Earth exists!"
Anat, according to Canaanite traditions, thus stood by her brother the Lord
(Baal) in his life-and-death struggle with the evil Mot; and the parallel between this
and the Greek tradition of the goddess Athena standing with the supreme god
Zeus in his life-and-death struggle with Typhon is only too obvious. Athena, as we
have seen, was called "the perfect maiden," yet had many illicit love affairs.
Likewise, Canaanite traditions (which preceded the Greek ones) employed the
epithet "the Maiden Anat," and, in spite of this, proceeded to report her various
love affairs, especially with her own brother Baal. One text describes the arrival of
Anat at Baal's abode on Mount Zaphon, and Baal's hurried dismissal of his wives.
Then he sank by his sister's feet; they looked into each other's eyes; they anointed
each other's "horns"—
He seizes and holds her womb…
She seizes and holds his "stones."…
The maiden Anat … is made to conceive and bear.
No wonder, then, that Anat was often depicted completely naked, to emphasize
her sexual attributes—as in this seal impression, which illustrates a helmeted
Baal battling another god. (Fig. 36)
Illustration:
Goddess Anat
Like the Greek religion and its direct forerunners, the Canaanite pantheon
included a Mother Goddess, official consort of the chief deity. They called her
Ashera; she paralleled the Greek Hera. Astarte (the biblical Ashtoreth) paralleled
Aphrodite; her frequent consort was Athtar, who was associated with a bright
planet, and who probably paralleled Ares, Aphrodite's brother. There were other
young deities, male and female, whose astral or Greek parallels can easily be
surmised.
But besides these young deities there were the "olden gods," aloof from
mundane affairs but available when the gods themselves ran into serious trouble.
Some of their sculptures, even in a partly damaged state, show them with
commanding features, gods recognizable by their homed headgear. (Fig. 37)
Illustration:
God with Horned Headgear
Whence had the Canaanites, for their part, drawn their culture and religion?
The Old Testament considered them a part of the Hamitic family of nations, with
roots in the hot (for that is what ham meant) lands of Africa, brothers of the
Egyptians. The artifacts and written records unearthed by archaeologists confirm
the close affinity between the two, as well as the many similarities between the
Canaanite and Egyptian deities.
The many national and local gods, the multitude of their names and epithets,
the diversity of their roles, emblems, and animal mascots at first cast the gods of
Egypt as an unfathomable crowd of actors upon a strange stage. But a closer look
reveals that they were essentially no different from those of the other lands of the
ancient world.
The Egyptians believed in Gods of Heaven and Earth, Great Gods that were
clearly distinguished from the multitudes of lesser deities. G. A. Wainwright (The
Sky-Religion in Egypt) summed up the evidence, showing that the Egyptian belief
in Gods of Heaven who descended to Earth from the skies was "extremely ancient."
Some of the epithets of these Great Gods—Greatest God, Bull of Heaven,
Lord/Lady of the Mountains—sound familiar.
Although the Egyptians counted by the decimal system, their religious affairs
were governed by the Sumerian sexagesimal sixty, and celestial matters were
subject to the divine number twelve. The heavens were divided into three parts,
each comprising twelve celestial bodies. The afterworld was divided into twelve
parts. Day and night were each divided into twelve hours. And all these divisions
were paralleled by "companies" of gods, which in turn consisted of twelve gods
each.
The head of the Egyptian pantheon was Ra ("creator"), who presided over an
Assembly of the Gods that numbered twelve. He performed his wondrous works of
creation in primeval times, bringing forth Geb ("Earth") and Nut ("sky"). Then he
caused the plants to grow on Earth, and the creeping creatures—and, finally, Man.
Ra was an unseen celestial god who manifested himself only periodically. His
manifestation was the Aten—the Celestial Disc, depicted as a Winged Globe. (Fig.
38)
Illustration:
The Winged Globe
The appearance and activities of Ra on Earth were, according to Egyptian
tradition, directly connected with kingship in Egypt. According to that tradition,
the first rulers of Egypt were not men but gods, and the first god to rule over Egypt
was Ra. He then divided the kingdom, giving Lower Egypt to his son Osiris and
Upper Egypt to his son Seth. But Seth schemed to overthrow Osiris and eventually
had Osiris drowned. Isis, the sister and wife of Osiris, retrieved the mutilated body
of Osiris and resurrected him. Thereafter, he went through "the secret gates" and
joined Ra in his celestial path; his place on the throne of Egypt was taken over by
his son Horus, who was sometimes depicted as a winged and horned deity. (Fig.
39)
Illustration:
Horus, a Winged and Horned Deity
Though Ra was the loftiest in the heavens, upon Earth he was the son of the
god Ptah ("developer," "one who fashioned things"). The Egyptians believed that
Ptah actually raised the land of Egypt from under floodwaters by building dike
works at the point where the Nile rises. This Great God, they said, had come to
Egypt from elsewhere; he established not only Egypt but also "the mountain land
and the far foreign land." Indeed, the Egyptians acknowledged, all their "olden
gods" had come by boat from the south; and many prehistoric rock drawings have
been found that show these olden gods—distinguished by their horned
headdress—arriving in Egypt by boat. (Fig. 40)
Illustration:
Gods Arriving by Boat

The only sea route leading to Egypt from the south is the Red Sea, and it is
significant that the Egyptian name for it was the Sea of Ur. Hieroglyphically, the
sign for Ur meant "the far-foreign [land] in the east"; that it actually may also have
referred to the Sumerian Ur, lying in that very direction, cannot be ruled out.
The Egyptian word for "divine being" or "god" was NTR, which meant "one who
watches." Significantly, that is exactly the meaning of the name Shumer: the land
of the "ones who watch."

The earlier notion that civilization may have begun in Egypt has been discarded
by now. There is ample evidence now showing that the Egyptian-organized society
and civilization, which began half a millennium and more after the Sumerian one,
drew its culture, architecture, technology, art of writing, and many other aspects
of a high civilization from Sumer. The weight of evidence also shows that the gods
of Egypt originated in Sumer.

Cultural and blood kinsmen of the Egyptians, the Canaanites shared the same
gods with them. But, situated in the land strip that was the bridge between Asia
and Africa from time immemorial, the Canaanites also came under strong Semitic
or Mesopotamian influences. Like the Hittites to the north, the Hurrians to the
northeast, the Egyptians to the south, the Canaanites could not boast of an
original pantheon. They, too, acquired their cosmogony, deities, and legendary
tales from elsewhere. Their direct contacts with the Sumerian source were the
Amorites.



The land of the Amorites lay between Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean lands
of western Asia. Their name derives from the Akkadian amurru and Sumerian
martu ("westerners"), they were not treated as aliens but as related people who
dwelt in the western provinces of Sumer and Akkad.

Persons bearing Amorite names were listed as temple functionaries in Sumer.
When Ur fell to Elamite invaders circa 2000 B.C., a Martu named Ishbi-Irra
reestablished Sumerian kingship at Larsa and made his first task the recapture of
Ur and the restoration there of the great shrine to the god Sin. Amorite "chieftains"
established the first independent dynasty in Assyria circa 1900 B.C. And
Hammurabi, who brought greatness to Babylon circa 1800 B.C., was the sixth
successor of the first dynasty of Babylon, which was Amorite.
In the 1930s archaeologists came upon the center and capital city of the
Amorites, known as Mari. At a bend of the Euphrates, where the Syrian border
now cuts the river, the diggers uncovered a major city whose buildings were
erected and continuously reerected, between 3000 and 2000 B.C., on foundations
that date to centuries earlier. These earliest remains included a step pyramid and
temples to the Sumerian deities Inanna, Ninhursag, and Enlil.
The palace of Mari alone occupied some five acres and included a throne room
painted with most striking murals, three hundred various rooms, scribal
chambers, and (most important to the historian) well over twenty thousand tablets
in the cuneiform script, dealing with the economy, trade, politics, and social life of
those times, with state and military matters, and, of course, with the religion of
the land and its people. One of the wall paintings at the great palace of Mari
depicts the investiture of the king Zimri-Lim by the goddess Inanna (whom the
Amorites called Ishtar). (Fig. 41)

As in the other pantheons, the chief deity physically present among the Amurru
was a weather or storm god. They called him Adad—the equivalent of the
Canaanite Baal ("lord")—and they nicknamed him Hadad. His symbol, as might be
expected, was forked lightning.

In Canaanite texts, Baal is often called the "Son of Dagon." The Mari texts also
speak of an older deity named Dagan, a "Lord of Abundance" who—like El—is
depicted as a retired deity, who complained on one occasion that he was no longer
consulted on the conduct of a certain war.


Other members of the pantheon included the Moon God, whom the Canaanites called Yerah, the Akkadians Sin, and the Sumerians Nannar; the Sun God, commonly called Shamash; and other deities whose identities leave no doubt that Mari was a bridge (geographically and chronologically) connecting the lands and the peoples of the eastern Mediterranean with the Mesopotamian sources. 

Among the finds at Mari, as elsewhere in the lands of Sumer, there were dozens of statues of the people themselves: kings, nobles, priests, singers. They were invariably depicted with their hands clasped in prayer, their gaze frozen forever toward their gods. (Fig. 42)


Who were these Gods of Heaven and Earth, divine yet human, always headed by
a pantheon or inner circle of twelve deities?

We have entered the temples of the Greeks and the Aryans, the Hittites and the
Hurrians, the Canaanites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. We have followed
paths that took us across continents and seas, and clues that carried us over
several millennia.

All the corridors of all the temples have led us to one source: Sumer.
