<!-- About a century ago the decipherment of the texts found in Mesopotamia unexpectedly grew into a realization that there—in Mesopotamia—texts existed that not only paralleled but also preceded portions of the Holy Scriptures. 

Die Keilschriften und das aite Testament by Eberhard Schrader in 1872 started an avalanche of books, articles, lectures, and debates that lasted half a century.  -->

Was there a link, at some early time, between Babylon and the Bible, as Babel and Bibel?

Henry Layard found a tale of Creation similar to the one in the Book of Genesis in the ruins of the library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh.

The broken tablets were first pieced together and published by George Smith in 1876 (The Chaldean Genesis). 

<!-- It conclusively established that there indeed existed an Akkadian text, written in the Old Babylonian dialect, that related how a certain deity created Heaven and Earth and all upon Earth, including Man. -->

<!-- A vast literature now exists that compares the Mesopotamian text with the biblical narrative.  -->


Now called "The Creation Epic", the text was known in antiquity by its opening words, Enuma Elish ("When in the heights"). 

The biblical tale of Creation begins with the creation of Heaven and Earth.

The Babylonian deity's work was done, if not in six "days," then over the span of six tablets. 

Parallel to the biblical God's seventh day of rest and enjoyment of his handiwork, the Mesopotamian epic devotes a seventh tablet to the exaltation of the Babylonian deity and his achievements. 

<!-- Appropriately, L. W. King named his authoritative text on the subject The Seven Tablets of Creation. -->

It was then that 2 primeval celestial bodies Apsu and Tiamat gave birth to a series of celestial "gods."
- The number of celestial beings increased, making great noise and commotion, disturbing the Primeval Father Apsu. 

His faithful messenger urged him to take strong measures to discipline the young gods. 
- But they ganged up on him and robbed him of his creative powers. 

The Primeval Mother Tiamat sought to take revenge and became a "monster".

The god who led the revolt against the Primeval Father had a new suggestion: Let his young son Marduk be invited to join the Assembly of the Gods and be given supremacy so that he can fight singlehanded their mother.

Marduk then vanquished her Tiamat and split her in two.
- Of one part of her he made Heaven, and of the other, Earth. 

He then proclaimed a fixed order in the heavens, assigning to each celestial god a permanent position.

On Earth he produced the mountains and seas and rivers, established the seasons and vegetation, and created Man. 

<!-- In duplication of the Heavenly Abode, Babylon and its towering temple were built on Earth. Gods and mortals were given assignments, commandments, and rituals to be followed.  -->

The gods then proclaimed Marduk the supreme deity, and bestowed on him the "50 names"—the prerogatives and numerical rank of the Enlilship.

<!-- As more tablets and fragments were found and translated, it became evident
that the text was not a simple literary work: It was the most hallowed historicalreligious epic of Babylon, read as part of the New Year rituals.  -->

The texts were intended to propagate the supremacy of Marduk, the Babylonian version made him the hero of the tale of Creation.

<!-- This, however, was not always so. There is enough evidence to show that  -->

The Babylonian version of the epic was a masterful religious-political forgery of earlier Sumerian versions, in which Anu, Enlil, and Ninurta were the heroes.

Act I:
When in the heights Heaven had not been named,
And below, Earth had not been called;
Naught, but primordial APSU, their Begetter,
MUMMU, and TIAMAT—she who bore them all;
Their waters were mingled together.

No reed had yet formed, no marshland had appeared.
None of the gods had yet been brought into being,
None bore a name, their destinies were undetermined;
Then it was that gods were formed in their midst.
{{< /q >}}


In the expanse of space, the "gods"—the planets—are yet to appear, to be named, to have their "destinies"—their orbits—fixed. 

Only 3 bodies exist: 

1. "primordial AP.SU" ("one who exists from the beginning")
2. MUM.MU ("one who was born")
3. TIAMAT ("maiden of life")

The primordial "waters"* of Apsu and Tiamat were mingled. This represented basic life-giving elements of the universe.

{{< n n="In Cartesian Physics, this is the 2nd Element or spacetime. It means they were within the gravitational fields of each other" >}}


Apsu, then, is the Sun, "one who exists from the beginning."

Nearest him is Mummu -- the trusted aide and emissary of Apsu.*

{{< n n="In Cartesian Physics, Apsu is the 1st Element, Mummu is the 4th Element, and Tiamat is the 3rd Element. The 4th Element is connected to the 1st Element and is now called Electroweak Interaction" >}}


<!-- : a good description of Mercury, the small planet rapidly running around his giant master. This was the concept the ancient Greeks and Romans had of the god-planet Mercury: the fast messenger of the gods. -->

Farther away was Tiamat. 

<!-- She was the "monster" that Marduk later shattered—the "missing planet." But  -->

In primordial times she was the very first Virgin Mother of the first Divine Trinity. 

The space between her and Apsu was not void; it was filled with the primordial elements of Apsu and Tiamat. 

These "waters" "commingled," and a pair of celestial gods-planets-were formed in the space between Apsu and Tiamat.
