The planet Marduk was a great traveler in the heavens, soaring to immense heights at its apogee and then "coming down, bowing unto the Heaven" at its perigee. It was depicted as a Winged Globe.

The symbol of the Winged Globe was conspicuous among the remains of Near Eastern peoples. It was:
- dominating temples and palaces
- carved on rocks
- etched on cylinder seals
- painted on walls. 
- accompanying kings and priests
- standing  above their thrones
- "hovered" above them in battle scenes
- was etched into their chariots. 

Clay, metal, stone, and wood objects were adorned with the symbol. 

The rulers of Sumer and Akkad, Babylon and Assyria, Elam and Urartu, Mari and Nuzi, Mitanni and Canaan—all revered the symbol. 

Hittite kings, Egyptian pharaohs, Persian shar's—all proclaimed the symbol (and what it stood for) supreme. 

It remained so for millennia. (Fig. 112)

The ancient world believed that the 12th Planet, the "Planet of the Gods":
- remained within the solar system 
- had its grand orbit returning it periodically to Earth's vicinity.


The pictographic sign for the 12th Planet, the "Planet of Crossing," was a cross.

This cuneiform sign, , which also meant "Anu" and "divine," evolved in the Semitic languages to the letter tav, which meant "the sign." 

All the peoples of the ancient world considered the periodic nearing of the 12th Planet as a sign of upheavals, great changes, and new eras. 

The Mesopotamian texts spoke of the planet's periodic appearance as an anticipated, predictable, and observable event:


{{< q >}}
The great planet:
At his appearance, dark red.
The Heaven he divides in half
and stands as Nibiru.
{{< /q >}}

Many of the texts dealing with the planet's arrival were omen texts prophesying the effect the event would have upon Earth and Mankind. 

R. Campbell Thompson (Reports of the Magicians and Astronomers of Nineveh and Babylon) reproduced several such texts, which trace the progress of the planet as it "ringed the station of Jupiter" and arrived at the point of crossing, Nibiru:

{{< q >}}
When from the station of Jupiter
the Planet passes towards the west,
there will be a time of dwelling in security.
Kindly peace will descend on the land.
When from the station of Jupiter
the Planet increases in brilliance
and in the Zodiac of Cancer will become Nibiru,
Akkad will overflow with plenty,
the king of Akkad will grow powerful.
When Nibiru culminates…
The lands will dwell securely,
Hostile kings will be at peace,
The gods will receive prayers and hear supplications.
{{< /q >}}


The nearing planet, however, was expected to cause rains and flooding, as its strong gravitational effects have been known to do:

{{< q >}}
When the Planet of the Throne of Heaven
will grow brighter,
there will be floods and rains…
When Nibiru attains its perigee,
the gods will give peace;
troubles will be cleared up,
complications will be unravelled.
Rains and floods will come.
{{< /q >}}


Like the Mesopotamian savants, the Hebrew prophets considered the time of the planet's approaching Earth and becoming visible to Mankind as ushering in a new era. 

The similarities between the Mesopotamian omens of peace and prosperity that would accompany the Planet of the Throne of Heaven, and the biblical prophesies of the peace and justice that would settle upon Earth after the Day of the Lord, can best be expressed in the words of Isaiah:


{{< q >}}
And it shall come to pass at the End of Days:
…the Lord shall judge among the nations
and shall rebuke many peoples.
They shall beat their swords into ploughshares
and their spears into pruning hooks;
nation shall not lift up sword against nation.
{{< /q >}}


In contrast with the blessings of the new era following the Day of the Lord, the day itself was described by the Old Testament as a time of rains, inundations, and earthquakes. 

If we think of the biblical passages as referring, like their Mesopotamian counterparts, to the passage in Earth's vicinity of a large planet with a strong gravitational pull, the words of Isaiah can be plainly understood:


{{< q >}}
Like the noise of a multitude in the mountains,
a tumultous noise like of a great many people,
of kingdoms of nations gathered together;
it is the Lord of Hosts,
commanding a Host to battle.

From a far away land they come,
from the end-point of the Heaven
do the Lord and his Weapons of wrath
come to destroy the whole Earth…
Therefore will I agitate the Heaven
and Earth shall be shaken out of its place
when the Lord of Hosts shall be crossing,
the day of his burning wrath.
{{< /q >}}

While on Earth "mountains shall melt … valleys shall be cleft,"  Earth's axial
spin would also be affected. The prophet Amos explicitly predicted:

{{< q >}}
It shall come to pass on that Day, sayeth the Lord God,
that I will cause the Sun to go down at noon
and I will darken the Earth in the midst of daytime.
{{< /q >}}


Announcing, "Behold, the Day of the Lord is come!" the prophet Zechariah
informed the people that this phenomenon of an arrest in Earth's spin around its
own axis would last only one day:


{{< q >}}
And it shall come to pass on that Day
there shall be no light—uncommonly shall it freeze.
And there shall be one day, known to the Lord,
which shall be neither day nor night,
when at eve-time there shall be light.
{{< /q >}}

On the Day of the Lord, the prophet Joel said, "the Sun and Moon shall be
darkened, the stars shall withdraw their radiance"; "the Sun shall be turned into
darkness, and the Moon shall be as red blood."
