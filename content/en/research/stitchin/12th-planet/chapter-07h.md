As part of the new celestial order on Earth, Marduk:
- "made the divine Moon appear
- designated him to mark the night, define the days every month."

The text calls Marduk as SHESH.KI ("celestial god who protects Earth"). 

There is no mention earlier in the epic of a planet by this name. Yet there he is, "within Tiamat's heavenly pressure [gravitational field]." 


Who is Tiamat?

The roles of, and references to, Tiamat and Earth appear to be interchangeable.

Earth is Tiamat reincarnated. The Moon is called Earth's "protector"; that is exactly what Tiamat called Kingu, her chief satellite.

The Creation epic specifically excludes Kingu from the "host" of Tiamat that were shortened and scattered and put into reverse motion around the Sun as comets.

After Marduk completed his own first orbit and returned to the scene of the battle, he decreed Kingu's separate fate:

{{< q >}}
Kingu, who had become chief among them,
He made shrink;
As god DUG.GA.E he counted him.
He took from him the Tablet of Destinies,
Not rightfully his.
{{< /q >}}




Marduk, then, did not destroy Kingu. He punished him by taking away his independent orbit, which Tiamat had granted him as he grew in size. 

Shrunk to a smaller size, Kingu remained a "god"—a planetary member of our solar system. 


Kingu had been:
- transformed into a celestial duggae
- stripped of his "vital" elements—atmosphere, waters, radioactive matter.

He shrank in size and became "a mass of lifeless clay." 

These Sumerian terms fittingly describe:
- our lifeless Moon
- how it started out as KIN.GU ("great emissary") and ended up as DUG.GA.E ("pot of lead").


L. W. King (The Seven Tablets of Creation) reported 3 fragments of an astronomical-mythological tablet. 
- It presented another version of Marduk's battle with Tiamat.

<!-- , which included verses that dealt with the manner in which Marduk dispatched Kingu.  -->

{{< q >}}
"Kingu, her spouse, with a weapon not of war he cut away … the Tablets of Destiny from Kingu he took in his hand." 
{{< /q >}}


B. Landesberger (in 1923, in the Archiv fur Keilschriftforschung) fully translated the text which demonstrated the interchangeability of the names Kingu/ Ensu/ Moon.

They:
- confirm my conclusion that Tiamat's main satellite became our Moon.
- explain NASA's findings of a huge collision "when celestial bodies the size of large cities came crashing into the Moon." 


Both the NASA findings and the text discovered by L. W. King describe the Moon as the "planet that was laid waste."


He punished him by taking away his independent orbit, which Tiamat had granted him as he grew in size. 

Shrunk to a smaller size, Kingu remained a "god"—a planetary member of our solar system. 

Without an orbit he could only become a satellite again. 

We suggest that Tiamat's upper part was thrown into a new orbit (as the new planet Earth) and Kingu was pulled along. 

Our Moon, we suggest, is Kingu, Tiamat's former satellite.


One such depiction shows Marduk shooting his lightning at Tiamat, with Kingu, clearly identified as the Moon, trying to protect Tiamat, his creator. (Fig. 109)

<!-- This pictorial evidence shows that our Moon and Kingu were the same satellite. -->

The god SIN in later times was associated with the Moon.
- It is derived from SU.EN ("lord of wasteland").

Having disposed of Tiamat and Kingu, Marduk once again "crossed the heavens and surveyed the regions." 

Gaga was the erstwhile satellite of Anshar/Saturn who was made an "emissary" to the other planets.
- This time Marduk's attention was focused on "the dwelling of Nudimmud" (Neptune), to fix a final "destiny" for Gaga.


Marduk assigned Gaga "to a hidden place" facing "the deep" (outer space). He entrusted to him the "counsellorship of the Watery Deep."

In line with his new position, the planet was renamed US.MI ("one who shows the way"), the outermost planet, our Pluto.

Marduk had at one point boasted:

{{< q >}}
I will artfully alter the ways of the celestial gods and divide them into 2 groups." 
{{< /q >}}


<!-- He eliminated from the heavens the Sun's first partner-inCreation, Tiamat. He brought Earth into being, thrusting it into a new orbit nearer the Sun.  -->

Marduk:
- eliminated Tiamat from the heavens
- hammered a "bracelet" in the heavens-the asteroid belt that separates the inner planets from outer ones.
- turned most of Tiamat's satellites into comets
- put her chief satellite, Kingu, into orbit around Earth to become the Moon
- shifted a satellite of Saturn, Gaga, to become the planet Pluto, imparting to it some of Marduk's own orbital characteristics (such as a different orbital plane).
- "constructed the stations" for the planets
- took for himself "Station Nibiru"
- "crossed the heavens and surveyed" the new solar system. 


The puzzles of our solar system are:
- the oceanic cavities on Earth
- the devastation on the Moon
- the reverse orbits of the comets
- the enigmatic phenomena of Pluto

These are all answered by the Mesopotamian Creation epic, as deciphered by me.

It was now made up of 12 celestial bodies, with 12 Great Gods as their counterparts. (Fig. 110)
