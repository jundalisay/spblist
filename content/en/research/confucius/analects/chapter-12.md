<!-- Yen Yuen=   -->
How should a person regard his fellow-man?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
Self-control, and a habit of falling back upon propriety, virtually effect it.

Let these conditions be fulfilled for one day, and every one round will betake himself to the duty. 

Is it to begin in one's self, or think you, indeed! it is to begin in others?

Without Propriety use not your eyes, ears, tongue, nor any limb of your body.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Yen-Yu" >}}
I may be lacking in diligence. But with your favor I will endeavor to carry out this advice.
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Chung-Kung" >}}
How should men regard his fellow-man?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
When you go forth from your door, act as if you were meeting some important guest.

When you are employing the common people (for State purposes), act as if you were taking part in a great religious function.

Do not set before others what you do not desire yourself. 

Let there be no resentful feelings against you when you are away in the country, and none when at home.

{{< r a="Szma-Niu" >}}
How can we do this?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
The words of the man who has a proper regard for his fellows are uttered with difficulty.

<!-- "'His wordsï¿½uttered with difficulty?'" he echoed, in surprise. "Is that what is meant by proper regard for one's fellow-creatures?"  -->

Where there is difficulty in doing, will there not be some difficulty in utterance?

{{< r a="Szma-Niu" >}}
What are 'superior men'? 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
Superior men are free from trouble and apprehension.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Szma-Niu" >}}
Does that make them 'superior men'?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
Where there is found, upon introspection, to be no chronic disease, how shall there be any trouble? how shall there be any apprehension?
{{< /l  >}}

{{< r a="Szma-Niu" >}}
I am troubled because I am alone in having no brother, while all else have theirs younger or elder.
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Tsz-Hi" >}}
I have heard that: 'Death and life have destined times. Wealth and honors rest with Heaven. 

Let the superior man keep watch over himself without ceasing, showing deference to others, with propriety of manners. Then all within the four seas will be his brethren. 

How should he be distressed for lack of brothers!' [29]

{{< r a="Tsz-Chang" >}}
How can we say if a man is "enlightened"? 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
An enlightened man is someone with whom drenching slander and cutting calumny gain no currency. Such men are extremely enlightened.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Tsz-Kung" >}}
What are the essentials of government?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
A government has 3 essentials:

1. Sufficient food
2. Sufficient armament
3. The people's confidence
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Tsz-Kung" >}}
But if you cannot really have all three, and one has to be given up, which would you give up first?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
The armament.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Tsz-Kung" >}}
And if you are obliged to give up one of the remaining two, which would it be?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
The food. Death has been the portion of all men from of old. Without the people's trust nothing can stand.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Kih-Tsz-Shing" >}}
Give me the inborn qualities of a gentleman, and I want no more. How are such to come from book-learning?" 
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Tsz-Kung" >}}
Sir, I regret to hear such words from you. A gentleman! But 'a team of four can ne'er o'er-take the tongue!' Literary accomplishments are much the same as inborn qualities, and inborn qualities as literary accomplishments. A tiger's or leopard's skin without the hair might be a dog's or sheep's when so made bare.
