§ 5. The Composition of Velocities

In the system k moving along the axis of X of the system K with velocity v,
let a point move in accordance with the equations
ξ = wξ τ, η = wη τ, ζ = 0,
where wξ and wη denote constants.
Required: the motion of the point relatively to the system K. If with the help
of the equations of transformation developed in § 3 we introduce the quantities
x, y, z, t into the equations of motion of the point, we obtain
x=
y=
z= 0.
wξ + v
t,
1 + vwξ /c2
p
1 − v 2 /c2
wη t,
1 + vwξ /c2
Thus the law of the parallelogram of velocities is valid according to our
theory only to a first approximation. We set

2

V2=dx
dt
w2=wξ2 + wη2 ,
a=tan−1 wy /wx ,
+
dy
dt
2
,
a is then to be looked upon as the angle between the velocities v and w. After
a simple calculation we obtain
p
(v 2 + w2 + 2vw cos a) − (vw sin a/c2 )2
.
V =
1 + vw cos a/c2
7 Not a pendulum-clock, which is physically a system to which the Earth belongs. This
case had to be excluded.
11It is worthy of remark that v and w enter into the expression for the resultant
velocity in a symmetrical manner. If w also has the direction of the axis of X,
we get
V =
v+w
.
1 + vw/c2
It follows from this equation that from a composition of two velocities which
are less than c, there always results a velocity less than c. For if we set v =
c − κ, w = c − λ, κ and λ being positive and less than c, then
V =c
2c − κ − λ
< c.
2c − κ − λ + κλ/c
It follows, further, that the velocity of light c cannot be altered by compo-
sition with a velocity less than that of light. For this case we obtain
V =
c+w
= c.
1 + w/c
We might also have obtained the formula for V, for the case when v and w have
the same direction, by compounding two transformations in accordance with §
3. If in addition to the systems K and k figuring in § 3 we introduce still another
system of co-ordinates k 0 moving parallel to k, its initial point moving on the
axis of X with the velocity w, we obtain equations between the quantities x,
y, z, t and the corresponding quantities of k 0 , which differ from the equations
found in § 3 only in that the place of “v” is taken by the quantity
v+w
;
1 + vw/c2
from which we see that such parallel transformations—necessarily—form a group.
We have now deduced the requisite laws of the theory of kinematics cor-
responding to our two principles, and we proceed to show their application to
electrodynamics.
II. ELECTRODYNAMICAL PART
§ 6. Transformation of the Maxwell-Hertz Equations for
Empty Space. On the Nature of the Electromotive Forces
Occurring in a Magnetic Field During Motion
Let the Maxwell-Hertz equations for empty space hold good for the stationary
system K, so that we have
1 ∂X

∂M
∂y − ∂z ,1 ∂L
c ∂t=∂Y

12where (X, Y, Z) denotes the vector of the electric force, and (L, M, N) that of
the magnetic force.
If we apply to these equations the transformation developed in § 3, by re-
ferring the electromagnetic processes to the system of co-ordinates there intro-
duced, moving with the velocity v, we obtain the equations

Now the principle of relativity requires that if the Maxwell-Hertz equations
for empty space hold good in system K, they also hold good in system k; that
is to say that the vectors of the electric and the magnetic force—(X0 , Y0 , Z0 )
and (L0 , M0 , N0 )—of the moving system k, which are defined by their pondero-
motive effects on electric or magnetic masses respectively, satisfy the following
equations:—

Evidently the two systems of equations found for system k must express
exactly the same thing, since both systems of equations are equivalent to the
Maxwell-Hertz equations for system K. Since, further, the equations of the two
systems agree, with the exception of the symbols for the vectors, it follows that
the functions occurring in the systems of equations at corresponding places must
agree, with the exception of a factor ψ(v), which is common for all functions
of the one system of equations, and is independent of ξ, η, ζ and τ but depends
upon v. Thus we have the relations

If we now form the reciprocal of this system of equations, firstly by solving
the equations just obtained, and secondly by applying the equations to the
inverse transformation (from k to K), which is characterized by the velocity −v,
it follows, when we consider that the two systems of equations thus obtained
must be identical, that ψ(v)ψ(−v) = 1. Further, from reasons of symmetry8
and therefore
ψ(v) = 1,
and our equations assume the form

As to the interpretation of these equations we make the following remarks: Let
a point charge of electricity have the magnitude “one” when measured in the
stationary system K, i.e. let it when at rest in the stationary system exert a
force of one dyne upon an equal quantity of electricity at a distance of one cm.
By the principle of relativity this electric charge is also of the magnitude “one”
when measured in the moving system. If this quantity of electricity is at rest
relatively to the stationary system, then by definition the vector (X, Y, Z) is
equal to the force acting upon it. If the quantity of electricity is at rest relatively
to the moving system (at least at the relevant instant), then the force acting
upon it, measured in the moving system, is equal to the vector (X0 , Y0 , Z0 ).
Consequently the first three equations above allow themselves to be clothed in
words in the two following ways:—
1. If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic field,
there acts upon it, in addition to the electric force, an “electromotive force”
which, if we neglect the terms multiplied by the second and higher powers of
v/c, is equal to the vector-product of the velocity of the charge and the magnetic
force, divided by the velocity of light. (Old manner of expression.)
2. If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic field,
the force acting upon it is equal to the electric force which is present at the
locality of the charge, and which we ascertain by transformation of the field to
a system of co-ordinates at rest relatively to the electrical charge. (New manner
of expression.)
The analogy holds with “magnetomotive forces.” We see that electromotive
force plays in the developed theory merely the part of an auxiliary concept,
8 If, for example, X=Y=Z=L=M=0, and N 6= 0, then from reasons of symmetry it is clear
that when v changes sign without changing its numerical value, Y 0 must also change sign
without changing its numerical value.
14which owes its introduction to the circumstance that electric and magnetic forces
do not exist independently of the state of motion of the system of co-ordinates.
Furthermore it is clear that the asymmetry mentioned in the introduction
as arising when we consider the currents produced by the relative motion of a
magnet and a conductor, now disappears. Moreover, questions as to the “seat”
of electrodynamic electromotive forces (unipolar machines) now have no point.
§ 7. Theory of Doppler’s Principle and of Aberration
In the system K, very far from the origin of co-ordinates, let there be a
source of electrodynamic waves, which in a part of space containing the origin
of co-ordinates may be represented to a sufficient degree of approximation by
the equations
X = X0 sin Φ,
Y = Y0 sin Φ,
Z = Z0 sin Φ,
where
L = L0 sin Φ,
M = M0 sin Φ,
N = N0 sin Φ,


Φ = ω t − (lx + my + nz) .


Here (X0 , Y0 , Z0 ) and (L0 , M0 , N0 ) are the vectors defining the amplitude of
the wave-train, and l, m, n the direction-cosines of the wave-normals. We wish
to know the constitution of these waves, when they are examined by an observer
at rest in the moving system k.
Applying the equations of transformation found in § 6 for electric and mag-
netic forces, and those found in § 3 for the co-ordinates and the time, we obtain
directly
X0 = X0 sin Φ0 ,
L0 = L0 sin Φ0 ,
0
0
Y = β(Y0 − vN0 /c) sin Φ , M0 = β(M0 + vZ0 /c) sin Φ0 ,
Z0 = β(Z0 + vM0 /c)sin Φ0 , N0 = β(N0 − vY0 /c) sin Φ0 ,
Φ0 = ω 0 τ − 1c (l0 ξ + m0 η + n0 ζ)

15From the equation for ω 0 it follows that if an observer is moving with velocity
v relatively to an infinitely distant source of light of frequency ν, in such a way
that the connecting line “source-observer” makes the angle φ with the velocity
of the observer referred to a system of co-ordinates which is at rest relatively
to the source of light, the frequency ν 0 of the light perceived by the observer is
given by the equation
1 − cos φ · v/c
.
ν0 = ν p
1 − v 2 /c2
This is Doppler’s principle for any velocities whatever. When φ = 0 the equation
assumes the perspicuous form
s
1 − v/c
0
ν =ν
.
1 + v/c
We see that, in contrast with the customary view, when v = −c, ν 0 = ∞.
If we call the angle between the wave-normal (direction of the ray) in the
moving system and the connecting line “source-observer” φ0 , the equation for l0
assumes the form
cos φ0 =
cos φ − v/c
.
1 − cos φ · v/c
This equation expresses the law of aberration in its most general form. If φ =
1
2 π, the equation becomes simply
cos φ0 = −v/c.
We still have to find the amplitude of the waves, as it appears in the moving
system. If we call the amplitude of the electric or magnetic force A or A0
respectively, accordingly as it is measured in the stationary system or in the
moving system, we obtain
2
A0 = A2
(1 − cos φ · v/c)2
1 − v 2 /c2
which equation, if φ = 0, simplifies into
2
A0 = A2
1 − v/c
.
1 + v/c
It follows from these results that to an observer approaching a source of light
with the velocity c, this source of light must appear of infinite intensity.
§ 8. Transformation of the Energy of Light Rays. Theory
of the Pressure of Radiation Exerted on Perfect Reflectors
Since A2 /8π equals the energy of light per unit of volume, we have to regard
2
A0 /8π, by the principle of relativity, as the energy of light in the moving system.
162
Thus A0 /A2 would be the ratio of the “measured in motion” to the “measured
at rest” energy of a given light complex, if the volume of a light complex were
the same, whether measured in K or in k. But this is not the case. If l, m, n are
the direction-cosines of the wave-normals of the light in the stationary system,
no energy passes through the surface elements of a spherical surface moving
with the velocity of light:—
(x − lct)2 + (y − mct)2 + (z − nct)2 = R2 .
We may therefore say that this surface permanently encloses the same light
complex. We inquire as to the quantity of energy enclosed by this surface,
viewed in system k, that is, as to the energy of the light complex relatively to
the system k.
The spherical surface—viewed in the moving system—is an ellipsoidal sur-
face, the equation for which, at the time τ = 0, is
(βξ − lβξv/c)2 + (η − mβξv/c)2 + (ζ − nβξv/c)2 = R2 .
If S is the volume of the sphere, and S0 that of this ellipsoid, then by a simple
calculation
p
1 − v 2 /c2
S0

S
1 − cos φ · v/c
Thus, if we call the light energy enclosed by this surface E when it is measured in
the stationary system, and E0 when measured in the moving system, we obtain

and this formula, when φ = 0, simplifies into

It is remarkable that the energy and the frequency of a light complex vary
with the state of motion of the observer in accordance with the same law.
Now let the co-ordinate plane ξ = 0 be a perfectly reflecting surface, at
which the plane waves considered in § 7 are reflected. We seek for the pressure
of light exerted on the reflecting surface, and for the direction, frequency, and
intensity of the light after reflexion.
Let the incidental light be defined by the quantities A, cos φ, ν (referred to
system K). Viewed from k the corresponding quantities are

The energy (measured in the stationary system) which is incident upon unit
area of the mirror in unit time is evidently A2 (c cos φ−v)/8π. The energy leaving
the unit of surface of the mirror in the unit of time is A0002 (−c cos φ000 + v)/8π.
The difference of these two expressions is, by the principle of energy, the work
done by the pressure of light in the unit of time. If we set down this work as
equal to the product Pv, where P is the pressure of light, we obtain
P=2·

All problems in the optics of moving bodies can be solved by the method
here employed. What is essential is, that the electric and magnetic force of the
light which is influenced by a moving body, be transformed into a system of
co-ordinates at rest relatively to the body. By this means all problems in the
optics of moving bodies will be reduced to a series of problems in the optics of
stationary bodies.

rigid bodies (ions, electrons), these equations are the electromagnetic basis of
the Lorentzian electrodynamics and optics of moving bodies.
Let these equations be valid in the system K, and transform them, with the

19Since—as follows from the theorem of addition of velocities (§ 5)—the vector
(uξ , uη , uζ ) is nothing else than the velocity of the electric charge, measured in
the system k, we have the proof that, on the basis of our kinematical principles,
the electrodynamic foundation of Lorentz’s theory of the electrodynamics of
moving bodies is in agreement with the principle of relativity.
In addition I may briefly remark that the following important law may easily
be deduced from the developed equations: If an electrically charged body is in
motion anywhere in space without altering its charge when regarded from a
system of co-ordinates moving with the body, its charge also remains—when
regarded from the “stationary” system K—constant.
§ 10. Dynamics of the Slowly Accelerated Electron
Let there be in motion in an electromagnetic field an electrically charged particle
(in the sequel called an “electron”), for the law of motion of which we assume
as follows:—
If the electron is at rest at a given epoch, the motion of the electron ensues
in the next instant of time according to the equations
d2 x
dt2
d2 y
m 2
dt
d2 z
m 2
dt
m
=X
=Y
=Z
where x, y, z denote the co-ordinates of the electron, and m the mass of the
electron, as long as its motion is slow.
Now, secondly, let the velocity of the electron at a given epoch be v. We
seek the law of motion of the electron in the immediately ensuing instants of
time.
Without affecting the general character of our considerations, we may and
will assume that the electron, at the moment when we give it our attention, is at
the origin of the co-ordinates, and moves with the velocity v along the axis of X
of the system K. It is then clear that at the given moment (t = 0) the electron
is at rest relatively to a system of co-ordinates which is in parallel motion with
velocity v along the axis of X.
From the above assumption, in combination with the principle of relativity, it
is clear that in the immediately ensuing time (for small values of t) the electron,
viewed from the system k, moves in accordance with the equations
d2 ξ
dτ 2
d2 η
m 2
dτ

=X0 ,
=Y0 ,
20m
d2 ζ
dτ 2

Z0 ,
in which the symbols ξ, η, ζ, X0 , Y0 , Z0 refer to the system k. If, further, we
decide that when t = x = y = z = 0 then τ = ξ = η = ζ = 0, the transformation
equations of §§ 3 and 6 hold good, so that we have
ξ = β(x − vt), η = y, ζ = z, τ = β(t − vx/c2 ),
X0 = X, Y0 = β(Y − vN/c), Z0 = β(Z + vM/c).
With the help of these equations we transform the above equations of motion
from system k to system K, and obtain

Taking the ordinary point of view we now inquire as to the “longitudinal”
and the “transverse” mass of the moving electron. We write the equations (A)

X0 ,
Y0 ,
Z0 ,
and remark firstly that X0 , Y0 , Z0 are the components of the ponderomotive
force acting upon the electron, and are so indeed as viewed in a system moving
at the moment with the electron, with the same velocity as the electron. (This
force might be measured, for example, by a spring balance at rest in the last-
mentioned system.) Now if we call this force simply “the force acting upon the
electron,”9 and maintain the equation—mass × acceleration = force—and if we
also decide that the accelerations are to be measured in the stationary system
K, we derive from the above equations
Longitudinal mass =
Transverse mass =
m
p
.
( 1 − v 2 /c2 )3
m
.
1 − v 2 /c2
With a different definition of force and acceleration we should naturally
obtain other values for the masses. This shows us that in comparing different
theories of the motion of the electron we must proceed very cautiously.
We remark that these results as to the mass are also valid for ponderable
material points, because a ponderable material point can be made into an elec-
tron (in our sense of the word) by the addition of an electric charge, no matter
how small.
9 The definition of force here given is not advantageous, as was first shown by M. Planck.
It is more to the point to define force in such a way that the laws of momentum and energy
assume the simplest form.
21We will now determine the kinetic energy of the electron. If an electron
moves from rest at the origin of co-ordinates of the system K along the axis
of X under the action of an electrostatic force X, it
R is clear that the energy
withdrawn from the electrostatic field has the value X dx. As the electron is
to be slowly accelerated, and consequently may not give off any energy in the
form of radiation, the energy withdrawn from the electrostatic field must be put
down as equal to the energy of motion W of the electron. Bearing in mind that
during the whole process of motion which we are considering, the first of the
equations (A) applies, we therefore obtain

Thus, when v = c, W becomes infinite. Velocities greater than that of light
have—as in our previous results—no possibility of existence.
This expression for the kinetic energy must also, by virtue of the argument
stated above, apply to ponderable masses as well.
We will now enumerate the properties of the motion of the electron which
result from the system of equations (A), and are accessible to experiment.
1. From the second equation of the system (A) it follows that an electric
force Y and a magnetic force N have an equally strong deflective action on an
electron moving with the velocity v, when Y = Nv/c. Thus we see that it is
possible by our theory to determine the velocity of the electron from the ratio
of the magnetic power of deflexion Am to the electric power of deflexion Ae , for
any velocity, by applying the law
Am
v
= .
Ae
c
This relationship may be tested experimentally, since the velocity of the
electron can be directly measured, e.g. by means of rapidly oscillating electric
and magnetic fields.
2. From the deduction for the kinetic energy of the electron it follows that
between the potential difference, P, traversed and the acquired velocity v of the
electron there must be the relationship

P = Xdx = c

3. We calculate the radius of curvature of the path of the electron when a
magnetic force N is present (as the only deflective force), acting perpendicularly
to the velocity of the electron. From the second of the equations (A) we obtain

These three relationships are a complete expression for the laws according
to which, by the theory here advanced, the electron must move.
In conclusion I wish to say that in working at the problem here dealt with
I have had the loyal assistance of my friend and colleague M. Besso, and that I
am indebted to him for several valuable suggestions.


<!-- About this Document
This edition of Einstein’s On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies is
based on the English translation of his original 1905 German-language paper
(published as Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper, in Annalen Der Physik.
17:891, 1905) which appeared in the book The Principle of Relativity, pub-
lished in 1923 by Methuen and Company, Ltd. of London. Most of the
papers in that collection are English translations from the German Das Rela-
tivatsprinzip, 4th ed., published by in 1922 by Tuebner. All of these sources
are now in the public domain; this document, derived from them, remains in
the public domain and may be reproduced in any manner or medium without
permission, restriction, attribution, or compensation.
Numbered footnotes are as they appeared in the 1923 edition; editor’s
notes are marked by a dagger (†) and appear in sans serif type. The 1923
English translation modified the notation used in Einstein’s 1905 paper to
conform to that in use by the 1920’s; for example, c denotes the speed of
light, as opposed the V used by Einstein in 1905.
This edition was prepared by John Walker. The current version of this
document is available in a variety of formats from the editor’s Web site:
