### § 4. Physical Meaning of the Equations Obtained in Respect to Moving Rigid Bodies and Moving Clocks

We envisage a rigid sphere6 of radius R, at rest relatively to the moving system
k, and with its centre at the origin of co-ordinates of k. The equation of the
surface of this sphere moving relatively to the system K with velocity v is
ξ 2 + η 2 + ζ 2 = R2 .

The equation of this surface expressed in x, y, z at the time t = 0 is
x2
p
+ y 2 + z 2 = R2 .
( 1 − v 2 /c2 )2
6 That is, a body possessing spherical form when examined at rest.
9A rigid body which, measured in a state of rest, has the form of a sphere,
therefore has in a state of motion—viewed from the stationary system—the
form of an ellipsoid of revolution with the axes
p
R 1 − v 2 /c2 , R, R.
Thus, whereas the Y and Z dimensions of the sphere (and therefore of every
rigid body of no matter what form) do not appear
p modified by the motion, the
X dimension appears shortened in the ratio 1 : 1 − v 2 /c2 , i.e. the greater the
value of v, the greater the shortening. For v = c all moving objects—viewed from
the “stationary” system—shrivel up into plane figures.† 

For velocities greater
than that of light our deliberations become meaningless; we shall, however, find
in what follows, that the velocity of light in our theory plays the part, physically,
of an infinitely great velocity.

It is clear that the same results hold good of bodies at rest in the “stationary”
system, viewed from a system in uniform motion.
Further, we imagine one of the clocks which are qualified to mark the time
t when at rest relatively to the stationary system, and the time τ when at rest
relatively to the moving system, to be located at the origin of the co-ordinates
of k, and so adjusted that it marks the time τ . What is the rate of this clock,
when viewed from the stationary system?
Between the quantities x, t, and τ , which refer to the position of the clock,
we have, evidently, x = vt and
1
τ=p
(t − vx/c2 ).
1 − v 2 /c2
Therefore,
τ =t
p
1 − v 2 /c2 = t − (1 −
p
1 − v 2 /c2 )t

whence it follows that the
p time marked by the clock (viewed in the stationary
system) is slow by 1 − 1 − v 2 /c2 seconds per second, or—neglecting magni-
tudes of fourth and higher order—by 12 v 2 /c2 .

From this there ensues the following peculiar consequence. If at the points A
and B of K there are stationary clocks which, viewed in the stationary system,
are synchronous; and if the clock at A is moved with the velocity v along the
line AB to B, then on its arrival at B the two clocks no longer synchronize,
but the clock moved from A to B lags behind the other which has remained at
B by 12 tv 2 /c2 (up to magnitudes of fourth and higher order), t being the time
occupied in the journey from A to B.

It is at once apparent that this result still holds good if the clock moves from
A to B in any polygonal line, and also when the points A and B coincide.
If we assume that the result proved for a polygonal line is also valid for a
continuously curved line, we arrive at this result: If one of two synchronous

10clocks at A is moved in a closed curve with constant velocity until it returns to
A, the journey lasting t seconds, then by the clock which has remained at rest
the travelled clock on its arrival at A will be 12 tv 2 /c2 second slow. Thence we
conclude that a balance-clock7 at the equator must go more slowly, by a very
small amount, than a precisely similar clock situated at one of the poles under
otherwise identical conditions.
