The following reflexions are based on the principle of relativity and on the
principle of the constancy of the velocity of light. These two principles we
define as follows:

1. The laws by which the states of physical systems undergo change are not
affected, whether these changes of state be referred to the one or the other of
two systems of co-ordinates in uniform translatory motion.

2. Any ray of light moves in the “stationary” system of co-ordinates with
the determined velocity c, whether the ray be emitted by a stationary or by a
moving body. Hence

velocity =
light path
time interval
where time interval is to be taken in the sense of the definition in § 1.

Let there be given a stationary rigid rod; and let its length be l as measured
by a measuring-rod which is also stationary. We now imagine the axis of the
rod lying along the axis of x of the stationary system of co-ordinates, and that
a uniform motion of parallel translation with velocity v along the axis of x in
the direction of increasing x is then imparted to the rod. We now inquire as to
the length of the moving rod, and imagine its length to be ascertained by the
following two operations:—

(a) The observer moves together with the given measuring-rod and the rod
to be measured, and measures the length of the rod directly by superposing the
measuring-rod, in just the same way as if all three were at rest.
(b) By means of stationary clocks set up in the stationary system and syn-
chronizing in accordance with § 1, the observer ascertains at what points of the
stationary system the two ends of the rod to be measured are located at a definite
time. The distance between these two points, measured by the measuring-rod
already employed, which in this case is at rest, is also a length which may be
designated “the length of the rod.”

In accordance with the principle of relativity the length to be discovered by
the operation (a)—we will call it “the length of the rod in the moving system”—
must be equal to the length l of the stationary rod.
The length to be discovered by the operation (b) we will call “the length
of the (moving) rod in the stationary system.” This we shall determine on the
basis of our two principles, and we shall find that it differs from l.
Current kinematics tacitly assumes that the lengths determined by these two
operations are precisely equal, or in other words, that a moving rigid body at
the epoch t may in geometrical respects be perfectly represented by the same
body at rest in a definite position.
We imagine further that at the two ends A and B of the rod, clocks are
placed which synchronize with the clocks of the stationary system, that is to say
that their indications correspond at any instant to the “time of the stationary
system” at the places where they happen to be. These clocks are therefore
“synchronous in the stationary system.”

We imagine further that with each clock there is a moving observer, and
that these observers apply to both clocks the criterion established in § 1 for the
synchronization of two clocks. Let a ray of light depart from A at the time4 tA ,
4 “Time” here denotes “time of the stationary system” and also “position of hands of the
moving clock situated at the place under discussion.”
4let it be reflected at B at the time tB , and reach A again at the time t0A . Taking
into consideration the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light we find
that
rAB
rAB
and t0A − tB =
t B − tA =
c−v
c+v
where rAB denotes the length of the moving rod—measured in the stationary
system. Observers moving with the moving rod would thus find that the two
clocks were not synchronous, while observers in the stationary system would
declare the clocks to be synchronous.

So we see that we cannot attach any absolute signification to the concept of
simultaneity, but that two events which, viewed from a system of co-ordinates,
are simultaneous, can no longer be looked upon as simultaneous events when
envisaged from a system which is in motion relatively to that system.
