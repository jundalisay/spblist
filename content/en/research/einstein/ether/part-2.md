My Special Relativity and space-time theory <!--  and the kinematics of the --> were modelled on the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of the electromagnetic field. 

<!-- This theory therefore satisfies the conditions of the special theory of relativity, but when viewed from the latter it acquires a novel aspect. For  -->

If `K` is a system of co-ordinates relatively to which the Lorentzian ether is at rest, the Maxwell-Lorentz equations are valid primarily with reference to `K`. 

But by Special Relativity, the same equations <!-- without any change of meaning --> also hold in relation to any new system of co-ordinates `K'` which is moving <!-- in uniform translation --> relatively to `K`. 

**But why must I distinguish the non-moving `K` system above all moving `K'` systems, which are physically equivalent to it in all respects, by assuming that the ether is at rest relatively to the non-moving `K` system?** 

{{< n n="We answer that the duality is essential because the non-moving `K` has properties that affect and explain the motions and dynamics within the moving `K'`. This is part of our Elastic Theory." >}} 


I think that such an asymmetry in the theoretical structure, with no corresponding asymmetry in the system of experience, is intolerable*. 

{{< n n="To Einstein, it is intolerable to have a dimension which is unknown. This asymmetry is the backstage of reality which facilitates faster-than-light travel" >}}


If the ether were at rest relatively to non-moving `K`, but in motion relatively to moving `K'`, the physical equivalence of non-moving `K` and moving `K'` is <!-- seems to me from the logical standpoint, not indeed  downright incorrect, but nevertheless-->  unacceptable.

{{< n n="It is acceptable because there is no void, and the non-moving ether is actually moving a bit relative to the non-moving `K`" >}}

<!-- The next position which it was possible to take up in face of this state of things appeared to be the following.  -->

Initially, the solution is that the ether does not exist at all. 

The electromagnetic fields: 
- are not states of a medium
- are not bound down to any bearer
- are independent realities* which are not reducible to anything else, exactly like the atoms of ponderable matter. 
- are electromagnetic radiation, according to Lorentz's theory. This is like ponderable matter bringing impulse and energy with it.

{{< n n="*Here, Einstein makes electromagnetism the supreme principle" >}}


**According to Special Relativity, both matter and radiation are but special forms of distributed energy, ponderable mass losing its isolation and appearing as a special form of energy.**

But afterwards, Special Relativity however does not compel us to deny ether. 

We may assume the existence of an ether. But it does not have a definite state of motion to it, i.e. we must remove its immobility. <!-- by abstraction take from it the last mechanical characteristic which Lorentz had still left it.  -->

<!-- We shall see later that this point of view, the conceivability of which I shall at once endeavour to make more intelligible by a somewhat halting comparison, is justified by the results of the general theory of relativity. -->

Think of waves on the surface of water. Here we can describe 2 entirely different things. Either we may observe how:

1. Changes in the water in a pond are shown by its wavy surface, or

 <!-- The wavy surface between water in a pond and the air  in time.  -->

2. Changes in the water in a pond are shown by buoys that act as markers

If such buoys were impossible, then we cannot say that water was made up of moving particles. But it would still be a medium. 

<!-- air alters in the course of time; or else — with the help of small floats, for instance — we can observe how the position of the separate particles of water alters in the course of time. --> 

<!-- If the existence of such floats for tracking the motion of the particles of a fluid were a fundamental impossibility in physics — if, in fact, nothing else whatever were observable than the shape of the space occupied by the water as it varies in time, we should have no ground for the assumption that water consists of movable particles.  -->

<!-- But all the same we could characterise it as a medium. -->

The electromagnetic field is like water, consisting of lines of force. 

Each separate line of force is tracked through time. But this way of regarding the electromagnetic field leads to contradictions.

<!-- If we wish to interpret these lines of force to ourselves as something material in the ordinary sense, we are tempted to interpret the dynamic processes as motions of these lines of force, such that  -->


There might be extended physical objects to which the idea of motion cannot be applied. They might not be made up of trackable particles*. 

{{< n n="The buoys would not be there." >}}

<!-- They may not be thought of as consisting of particles which allow themselves to be separately tracked through time.  -->

Minkowski expresses this as: Not every extended conformation in the four-dimensional world <!-- can be regarded as --> are composed of world-threads. 

In Special Relativity, the ether is made up of unobservable particles. But the ether hypothesis in itself is not in conflict with Special Relativity. 

<!-- Only we must be on our guard against -->

**We merely must not ascribe movement to the ether.** 

To Special Relativity, the ether hypothesis initially is an empty hypothesis. 

The equations of the electromagnetic field only have:
- the densities of the electric charge
- the intensities of the field. 

Electromagnetic processes in vacua are completely determined by these equations, uninfluenced by other physical quantities.

**The electromagnetic fields are ultimate, irreducible realities.** *
