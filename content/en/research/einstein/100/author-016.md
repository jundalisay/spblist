THE UNSUSTAINABILITY OF RELATIVITY THEORY

For an expert in logical matters, the untenability of Relativity can be explained very briefly and simply.

Because the concept of simultaneity and the equally central concept of existence
- both of the indefinable ultimate givens or basic concepts

1) The thought of Fresnel deals with different densities. In my private sense, I assume that if you
have a carafe of water on the table and then walk around the room with the carafe, the water will
have the same density in both cases. Fresnel was of the opinion that part of the ether remained and
another part was carried away - it is a daring and somewhat arbitrary arithmetic operation, the
arithmetic average number from the struggle to pull to calculate between these two “ethers.


belong, without which no thinking is possible - are so inextricably linked that with simultaneity also
the existence of certain things is thought and asserted: in mathematics the existence of thought
things, in physics the existence of real things. Conversely, existence without absolutely simultaneous
things is also absolute nothing. Since Relativity denies absolute simultaneity, it (unconsciously) denies
not only mathematics, but also empirical reality. A compelling proof of the empirical and logical
untenability of this “theory” can be made so fabulously short and simple.
The core point in the immense relativistic confusion of terms deserves to be explained in more detail
in connection with other fundamental terms. Without the two basic concepts just mentioned, no
thinking is possible, as I said.

The core point in the immense relativistic confusion of terms deserves to be explored in more detail
in connection with other fundamental terms. Without the two basic concepts just mentioned, no
thinking is possible, as I said. Even the indefinable concept of a set (e.g.) requires that the objects in
question be thought or postulated as existing at the same time, regardless of whether they move or
not. If one denies simultaneity, one obviously also denies the concept of number. Without
simultaneity, there can be no talk of uniformity, non-uniformity, speed and acceleration. Indeed,
consider the most general case where two bodies or points P and Q move along their
respective trajectories from the starting positions P_0, Q_0 at the same time. 

The trajectories may
[be at] rest in relation to one another or move as they like. In any case, we say that the movement of
P is uniform with respect to that of Q, if the ratio of the simultaneously travelled distances ([along]
railway lines) P0 P: Q0 Q constantly maintains the same constant value C at every instant (time) (or
shorter: if any but the same distances covered by Q always correspond to the same proportional
distances covered by P). C is called the speed of P if the movement of Q is regarded as normal
movement or time. This is a definition in the actual or true sense, which must not be confused with
explanations of names (nominal definitions).

So here absolutely simultaneous positions of P and Q must absolutely be postulated, if one wants to
form and apply the concepts of uniformity and speed at all. This definition is only an imaginary
comparison, but by no means observations, let alone measurements. Thinking is comparing and
establishing relations 1). The core of the relativistic confusion of terms lies precisely in the
fundamentally wrong view that a (physical) term could be defined by measurements and
observations. The strange thing1) We do not count the representations on which all thinking is based as part of actual thinking.

is that an exact conception of this question requires only the most elementary knowledge of the
theory of sizes. The relativists therefore lack the most elementary knowledge of size theory, despite
the fact that they also want to be mathematicians! Indeed, one must first of all know what to
measure before one can even measure. The concept (size) must therefore be present in
consciousness either as an indefinable given or as an already defined concept. In other words, the
concept in question is in all cases an empirical and logical presupposition of measurement: an
empirical one because measurement is not realized, a logical one because it cannot be thought
without first thinking of the concept as a determinateness to be measured . In short: the concept is
empirically and logically the primary, earlier (a priori), measuring is the secondary, later (a
posteriori).

Without exception, measurements and observations always set something to be measured or
observed, i.e. an already finished concept. If physics is to be called an empirically and logically exact
science, it must never define a concept through measurements and observations. This inevitably
creates a logical circle.

Once one has made these irrefutable logical truths clear to oneself, the empirical and logical
untenability of Relativity is also immediately clear. It is empirically untenable, above all because it
denies the absolute simultaneity, without which empirical reality cannot be thought at all. Because
the essence of this reality is that material things exist simultaneously, however they may move. It is
a logical impossibility, above all because it denies the absolute simultaneity, without which the
uniformly moving inertial systems which it presupposes have no meaning at all. Because without
absolute simultaneity there can be no talk of uniformity.

These are the consequences of the tremendous error of Relativity that it replaces logical comparison
with technical measurement. She [i.e. the theory] doesn't even know exactly what uniformity and
speed are, because otherwise she would know that there can be no talk of these terms without
absolute simultaneity, and even less would she set herself the pointless task of "measuring
simultaneity" what is already an impossibility because simultaneity is not a “quantity”! To solve this
pointless task, a “rule” is set!

Such senseless “rules” are called “assignment definitions”, and that is
what they are called in the relativistic “axiomatics”! - Relativity is the monstrous freak of illogical
thinking and will remain a warning example of an uncritical time for all times.


The above is independent of all philosophical views on time and space. Only the most basic
knowledge from the theory of sizes has been used above. 

It should therefore not present any significant difficulties in teaching the general public a correct understanding of the untenability of Relativity.
