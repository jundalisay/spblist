### Dr. WALTHER RAUSCHENBERGER / FRANKFURT

ANTI-EINSTEIN

1. There is no fundamental problem in Michelson's experiment.

It is explained in the simplest way by the fact that the rays of light are carried along by the earth, which is without any doubt the case. The rays of light are carried along as well as the electric waves of wireless telegraphy. 

Nobody here is surprised that the electric waves run just as fast in the direction of the earth's motion as they do in the opposite direction.


2. **The basic senselessness of Special Relativity is the assumption that one and the same ray of light should have the same speed in relation to any moving body!!!**

This is absolutely impossible - it is a completely insane thought.

<!-- It is only natural that this thought, if one spins it out further, should give rise to further senselessnesses which it is not necessary to enumerate in detail.

The following are mentioned for illustration purposes only.  -->

It is an absurdity that time stands still or even runs into the past, that bodies become two-dimensional beings when one moves with the speed of light or move faster than light.

This absurdity is not canceled out by the fact that nobody can move at the speed of light, or that faster than light is "forbidden" by the relativists.

The forward direction of time is certain a priori.

It is the most certain fact there is.

It is set with the happening itself.

Wherever there is movement there is a passage of time, even if one thinks a body is moving at the speed of light. 

In reality:
- there are no two-dimensional beings at all
- it is very possible that there is a faster movement than light, e.g. gravity.

No less absurd is the assumption that time and space expand or contract. 

Bodies can expand or contract in space and time, never time and space itself. The height of absurdity is to want to find confirmation for the RTH in experience.


3. The measurement of a body by an observer who is firmly connected to the body, resting opposite it, has the character of correctness under all circumstances, especially since the result of the visual sense is always through other senses, e.g. the sense of touch, can be confirmed or corrected. 

Any other observation from a moving system is, on the other hand, subjectively shifted if it leads to different results. Our perception, the way we see things, can be influenced by light, never things themselves.

4. The assumption that simultaneity is relative is completely absurd.

Each point in time is identical to itself. Now there are no points in time in reality, but only processes that are extended over time. 

But it can be a process of reality, e.g. the flash of a light, taken as a unit, and all processes of reality can be mathematically related to the process mentioned. This is only not possible if there are processes even faster than the movement of light.

This is why the fastest process is the basis of timing.

So only in this respect does light have a meaning for time. Should an even faster movement, for example in gravitation, be detected in the future, this would be the time scale for all processes in space.5. Much more puzzling than the content of the RTH is the fact that it is widely used.

Reason and logic seem too simple and self-evident to be able to satisfy people in the long run. Rather, setbacks and
catastrophes (such as wars in the cultural history of mankind) must appear here from time to time so
that reason can rise anew and its light can again become visible to mankind.

The recognition of Relativity is one of the strangest aberrations of the human mind remain memorable.
