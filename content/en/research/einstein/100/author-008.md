Dr. HANS ISRAEL /BERLIN MATHEMATICAL PRESENTATION OF RELATIVITY THEORY

The mathematical calculation of Relativity [that] has been carried out by Einstein [is] so erroneous,
that one can only express astonishment at it. Some samples should suffice to prove the recklessness
of his method:

1. Substitution x — vt = x' shall not apply to the reflected beam of light of the Michelson
interferometer directed against earth translation. The coincidence of the dormant and moving
mirror is achieved in this case by the substitution x + vt = x'. After that, the principle of relativity no
longer applies in general terms. Einstein himself calculates in his differential equation the velocities
c — v and c + v, which correspond to the substitutions above. So he refuted himself !

2. The relativistic shortening of results only in the middle interferometer mirror, while a
completely different value can be calculated at the other two mirrors. But Einstein maintains
relentlessly; After that, everything has been shortened evenly !


3. The addition theorem of the velocities is obtained by Einstein only by the gross calculation error,
two velocity systems c and w by the same coordinates
and despite the new substitution
to keep the factor c2 of the Lorentz transformation constant, instead of replacing c
proportionally with w.

4. In calculating the relativity factor ß, Einstein overlooks the rotational pulse of the earth's surface
of 426 m/sec, while tacitly executing the motion of the solar system according to the still image of
Hercules of 19 km /sec the beam of light. This with sun-ether as the reference system, which results
in a carrying [or entrainment] of the light beam in contrast to the relativity principle.

5. Since the aberration is a consequence of free aether-vibrations, while the Michelson interference
occurs with earth-bound light, there is no reason at all that both light types behave identically.
Rather, earth light must be internally related to the earth's potential.

6. By reshaping Maxwell's light wave equation: x2 + y2 +z2 -c2 t2 = 1, the t-coordinate acquires a
certain position without resulting in a physical change or a fourth dimension.

7. The gravitational field cannot be replaced by an accelerated system because both systems are not
equivalent. The substitution therefore does not give a coincidence of the
gravitational field with the opposite accelerated system.

8. The Newtonian law of gravity finds Einstein only by the inadmissible substitution ds = dx4 = dt. It
swaps categories of different senses and confuses mathematical equality with physical equivalence.

9. Since the strongest electrical influences fail to bend a beam of light, it is outrageous to want to
make humanity believe that gravity will be able to do so. Rather, we know that the solar atmosphere
can bend the starlight like a gas sphere.

[There are various critics of modern times that think light can’t be bent by gravity and instead
Eddington 1919 was dealing with light bent through the solar atmosphere. I personally don’t go for
that idea. I accept light can be bent by gravity as well as through solar atmosphere. It shows that
critics of Einstein’s relativity have different opinions on certain issues. So, one critic might dismiss
light bending by gravity while another might accept it. i.e. no unified viewpoint of critics, just a
multiple of different viewpoints.]

10. Einstein receives the Mercury deviation only by the erroneous notion that it is calculated
relativistically, while the classical rotation 2 ∏ is determined according to the usual method. There
is no physical explanation given at all. In our opinion, however, the rotating solar electric potential
can result in a bonding of Mercury, through which it hurries faster.

11. It is impossible to agree electrical and mechanical processes because their masses behave
differently in terms of inertia. This admits that the difference is alogical one.
[alogical means beyond logic.]

Since Einstein has taken note of the above errors of his work 1 ) without being able to refute them,
he has thus admitted the fiasco of Relativity.
