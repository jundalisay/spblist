Professor Dr. 0. KRAUS /PRAG TO RELATIVITY THEORIE 1 )

The optical experiment employed by Michelson seemed to show that the light emitted by an earthly light source behaved exactly as if the earth was resting, and that the light source was ejecting the light like a projectile, as if a projectile theory such as the Newtons and Poissons; or if you consider a wave theory:

as if the light ether is taken from the earth like the air in a ship's cabin. Both assumptions, however,
contradicted the prevailing electrodynamic theory of the aether at rest of H. A. Lorentz. According
to this theory, our earth leaves on its journey through the unresisted world ether [where the ether
is] completely at rest; Therefore, if Michelson in his famous experiment sent light waves back and
forth in the direction of travel of the planet and in a different direction, then one had to follow
Lorentz's theory of the stationary ether and expect that the light waves have to cover a longer or
shorter way and arrive later or earlier than they would arrive if the aether were carried away.
So how can one explain that the Michelson experiment turned out to be as if the Lorentz theory
were incorrect? It was a very daring hypothesis when Lorentz, instead of changing his theory,
assumed that the Michelson apparatus, and every body in general, would change quantitatively
when it moves, in such a way that the Michelson apparatus and every body in general converge in
the direction of its movement ! Through this "contraction hypothesis" Lorentz succeeded in
reconciling his theory with the results of the Michelson experiment that contradicted it. This
hypothesis of Lorentz may be strange, but it is in any case an attempt to explain the so-called"negative result" of the Michelson experiment while maintaining the hypothesis of the stationary
aether.

According to Einstein, however, "contraction is only a consequence of the point of view, not a
change of a physical reality" (Born), which is clear with all evidence from the fact that the Einstein
contraction took place only "for the non-moving observer", so that it depends on the presence and
the arbitrarily chosen positions of an observer, while the Lorentz contraction is intended as a process
physically independent of any observation.
According to Einstein, there is a very strange process: for the observer, everything remains
unchanged on the same system; for him it is not true that any lengths of his body shorten as a result
of movement, or that any of his clocks slow down. But the observer on the non-moving system
measures the lengths of the other system as shorter, the times as longer. Eddington, the English
proponent of Relativity, explicitly points out in his work translated by Teubner the fairytale nature of
these reciprocal pseudo-measurement, which has nothing in common with the Lorentzian
hypothesis of a real shortening from the mathematical formula.
Here only so much is said that the Einstein's principle of relativity "postulates" that in the measuring
comparison of the speed of a light reproduction (c) with that of a straight uniform motion (v) of any
other movable thing, there must always be a speed difference of 300000 km/sec in favour of light ;
18
in other words, the speed of light "plays the role of an infinite speed" that disappears from any other
speed. The paradox that c -v = c should always result for the measuring comparison is sought by that
reciprocal change in time scales (clocks) and continuing to make the spatial measures
comprehensible 1 ).
The change (shortening) of the spatial scales is quantitatively equal to Relativity, but — as stated
above — in a different way from the Lorentz contraction, i.e. only for the observer on a non-moving
system. Of course, these are not actual experiences, but "postulates" and by equating space and
time measure (clock) with space and time in the further course, those overturning teachings about
the relativity of "simultaneousness" and the lapse of everything that common sense, like that of
Newton, Euler and Kant, considers to be a priori evident arises. However, Relativity's criticism of Prof.
Wiener in Leipzig, who "Never can we make the size of a speed disappear by choosing the scale
alone, as is possible with the principle of relativity by choosing the inherent speed to be
withdrawn.""
