My principle of relativity states that any changes to 2 systems of coordinates that are in uniform motion parallel to each other are governed by laws which do not depend on either of them.

<!-- the laws by which the states of physical systems alter are independent of
the alternative, to which of 

, these alterations of state are referred. -->


I combined the following to answer the question whether inertia depends on energy-content:
- the Maxwell-Hertz equations for empty space
- the Maxwellian expression for the electromagnetic energy of space
- my principle of relativity

<!-- The changing states of physical systems are independent of the alternative, to which of two systems of coordinates, in uniform motion of parallel translation relatively to each other, these alterations of state are referred. -->

Let:
- a system of plane waves of light, referred to the system of co-ordinates (`x`, `y`, `z`), possess the energy `l`. 
- the direction of the ray (the wave-normal) make an angle `φ` with the axis of `x` of the system. 

We introduce a new system of coordinates (`ξ`, `η`, `ζ`) moving in uniform parallel translation with respect to the system (`x`, `y`, `z`).

The origin of its co-ordinates are in motion along the axis of `x` with the velocity `v`.

Then this quantity of light in the system (`ξ`, `η`, `ζ`) possesses the energy `l`

...

where `c` denotes the speed of light. 

Let there be a stationary body in the system (`x`, `y`, `z`). 
- Its energy is `E0`.
- Its energy relative to the system (`ξ`, `η`, `ζ`) moving as above with the velocity `v`, is `H0`.
<!-- —referred to the system (`x`, `y`, `z`) be   -->

This body send out plane waves of light of energy `1/2 L`.
- These waves are in a direction making an angle `φ` with the axis of `x`
- This is measured relatively:
  - to (`x, y, z`), and
  - simultaneously to an equal quantity of light in the opposite direction.*

{{< n n="This is the scam" >}}

The body remains at rest with respect to the system (`x`, `y`, `z`). 

<!-- The principle of ∗The principle of the constancy of the velocity of light is in Maxwell’s equations. -->

Energy must apply to this process and to both systems of co-ordinates via Relativity.

 <!-- by the principle of relativity, with respect to   -->

 

After the emission of light `E1` or `H1` respectively, we measure the energy of the body relatively to the system `(x, y, z)`` or `(ξ, η, ζ)` respectively. We obtain:

<!-- 
```
E0 = E1 + 
L + 1

H0 = H1 +

= H1 +
L

``` -->

...

By subtraction we obtain from these equations:

...

<!-- H0 − E0 − (H1 − E1) = L (1 p

```
1 − v
2/c2
− 1
)
``` -->


The two differences of the form `H − E` in this expression have simple physical significations. 

`H` and `E` are energy values of the same body referred to 2 systems of co-ordinates which are in motion relative to each other. 

The body is at rest in one of the two systems (system (`x, y, z`)). 

Thus, the difference `H − E` can differ from the kinetic energy `K` of the body, with respect to the other system (`ξ, η, ζ`), only by an additive constant `C`.

This `C` depends on the choice of the arbitrary additive constants of the energies `H` and `E`. 

Thus we may place:

```
H0 − E0 = K0 + C,
H1 − E1 = K1 + C,
```

`C` does not change during the emission of light. So we have:

...
<!-- ```
K0 − K1 = L (
1
p
1 − v
2/c2
− 1
)
``` -->


The kinetic energy of the body with respect to (`ξ, η, ζ`) diminishes as a result of the emission of light. 

The amount of reduction is independent of the properties of the body. 

Moreover, the difference `K0 − K1`, like the kinetic energy of the electron (§ 10), depends on the velocity.

Neglecting magnitudes of fourth and higher orders, we may place:

...

<!-- ```
K0 − K1 =
1
2
L
c
2
v

``` -->

From this equation, it directly follows that:

If a body gives off the energy `L` as radiation, its mass reduces by `L/c2`.

The fact that the energy withdrawn from the body becomes energy of radiation makes no difference. 

This leads us to the more general conclusion that **the mass of a body is a measure of its energy-content.**

If the energy changes by `L`, the mass changes in the same sense by `L/9 × 1020`, the energy being measured in ergs, and the mass in grams*.

{{< n n="In Cartesian Physics, any staticity or potential energy of the 1st and 3rd Elements can be made dynamic or kinetic via the 2nd Element (spacetime). This is because spacetime is totally kinetic. (Static 2nd Element is actually the atherspace around the 3rd Element). A reduction of 1st Element in a body would reduce its total mass in a very small way and is denoted in MeV. A reduction of 3rd element will reduce it a lot and is denoted in grams. **Einstein does not make a distinction between the 3rd and 1st Elements. This locks in matter with light, preventing any logical need for the aether or 5th Element**. This locking in is formalized by using light to measure the difference. This is not useful for teleporting masses, wherein the mass disappears. And so it makes the levitation and teleportation of masses logically impossible, which is not true" >}}

<!-- the mass or inertia changes because the lost radiation reduces the electromagnetism in the body. This frees up the body's spacetime particles, reducing their pushing pressure, manifesting as less mass or inertia. If the body is material (3rd Element), then mass and grams can be used. But if the body is non-material (i.e. electrons, neutrinos) then it should be electromagnetic potential measured in MeV." -->


This theory may be tested with bodies whose energy-content is very variable (e.g. with radium salts).

If the theory corresponds to the facts, radiation conveys inertia between the emitting and absorbing bodies.

### 1923 Note

This edition is based on the English translation of his original 1905 German paper which appeared in the book The Principle of Relativity, published in 1923 by Methuen and Company, Ltd. of London. 

 <!-- (published as Ist die Tr¨agheit eines K¨orpers von seinem Energiegehalt abh¨angig?, in Annalen der Physik. 18:639, 1905)  -->

<!--  Most of the papers in that collection are English translations by W. Perrett and G.B. Jeffery from the German Das Relativatsprinzip, 4th ed., published by in 1922 by Tuebner. 

All of these sources are now in the public domain. This document, derived from them, remains in the public domain and may be reproduced in any manner or medium without permission, restriction, attribution, or compensation.  -->

This translation modified the notation used in Einstein’s 1905 paper to conform to what is used by the 1920’s. For example, `c` is the speed of light, as opposed the `V` used by Einstein in 1905. 

In that paper, Einstein uses `L` to denote energy. The italicised sentence in the conclusion may be written as the equation “m = L/c2 ” which, using the more modern E instead of L to denote energy, may be trivially rewritten as “E = mc2”
