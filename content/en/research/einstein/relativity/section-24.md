THE surface of a marble table is spread out in front of me. 

I can get from any one point on this table to any other point by passing continuously from one point to a “neighbouring” one. I then repeat this process many times by going from point to point without executing “jumps.”

<!-- I am sure the reader will appreciate with sufficient clearness what I mean here by “neighbouring” and by “jumps” (if he is not too pedantic).  -->

We express this property of the surface by describing the latter as a continuum.

Many tiny rods of equal length have been made. Their lengths are small compared with the dimensions of the marble slab. 

"Equal length" means that one rod can be laid on any other without the ends overlapping. 

We lay 4 little rods on the marble slab so that they create a square. <!--  the diagonals of which are equally long. --> To ensure the equality of the diagonals, we use a little testing-rod. 

To this square, we add similar ones to fill the whole marble slab with squares. 
- Each square has one rod in common with the first.
- Each side of a square belongs to 2 squares.
- Each corner belongs to 4 squares. 

<!-- It is a veritable wonder that we can carry out this business without getting into the greatest
difficulties. We only need to think of the following.  -->

Extending this method will encounter difficulties. 

For example, if 3 squares meet at a corner, then 2 sides of the fourth square are already laid. As a consequence, the arrangement of the remaining 2 sides of the square is already completely determined. But I am now no longer able to adjust the quadrilateral so that its diagonals may be equal. If they are equal of their own accord, then this is an especial favour of the marble slab and of the little rods about which I can only be thankfully surprised.*

{{< n n="We do not understand this paragraph." >}}

<!-- We must needs experience many such surprises if the construction is to be successful. If everything has really gone smoothly, then I say that --> 

The points of the marble slab constitute a Euclidean continuum with respect to the little testing-rod, which has been used as a “distance” (line-interval).

By choosing one corner of a square as “origin” I can characterise every other corner of a square with reference to this origin through 2 numbers.

I only need state how many rods I must pass over when, starting from the origin, I proceed towards the “right” and then “upwards” in order to arrive at the corner of the square under consideration. 

These 2 numbers are then the “Cartesian co-ordinates” of this corner with reference to the “Cartesian coordinate system” which is determined by the arrangement of little rods.

<!-- By making use of the following modification of this abstract experiment, we recognise that there must also be cases in which the experiment would be unsuccessful. We shall suppose that  -->

Let us say that the rods “expand” with the increase of temperature. We heat the central part of the marble slab, but not the sides. This messes up our squares. <!-- periphery, in which case two of our little rods can still be brought into coincidence at every position on the table. But our construction of squares must necessarily come into disorder during the heating, because --> 

The little rods in the center of the table expand, whereas those on the outer part do not.

<!-- With reference to our little rods — defined as unit lengths — --> The marble slab no longer is a Euclidean continuum.*


{{< n n="In Euclid's Elements, 3D space is still Euclidean" >}}

We also can no longer use <!-- , and we are also no longer in the position of defining --> Cartesian coordinates<!--  directly with their aid , since the above construction can no longer be carried out.--> 

But since there are other things which are not influenced in a similar manner to the little rods (or perhaps not at all) by the temperature of the table, it is possible quite naturally to maintain the point of view that the marble slab is a “Euclidean continuum.”

This can be done  by making a more subtle stipulation about the measurement or the comparison of lengths.

Assume:
- all kinds of rods behaved in the same way in terms of temperature when they are on the variably heated marble slab
- the effect of temperature on the rods can only be detected through their geometrical behaviour in experiments as described above

Then our best plan would be to assign the distance one to two points on the slab, provided that the ends of one of our rods could be made to coincide with these 2 points.

We can only define the distance very arbitrarily.*

{{< n n="This is the whole problem with Einstein's sophistry, rooted in his definition of time as simultaneity measured by c: it creates arbitrary spacetime which is really imaginative and not real. This leads to imaginative theories like String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity which have no reality" >}}


Cartesian coordinates must then be discarded and replaced by another system which does not assume the validity of Euclidean geometry for rigid bodies*.

{{< f f="Mathematicians solved this in this way: An ellipsoid is in Euclidean 3D space. It has a 2D surface just like a plane. the situation depicted here corresponds to the one brought about by the general postulate of relativity (Section 23). Gauss used this 2D geometry from first principles, neglecting <!--  of the fact that the surface belongs to a --> the Euclidean continuum of three dimensions. If we stick to our example of the rigid rods on the marble slab, we will find that the laws of these rods are different from those of Euclidean plane geometry. Gauss pointed to Riemann's method of dealing with multidimensional, non-Euclidean continua. Thus, those mathematicians long ago solved the formal problems of General Relativity" >}}
