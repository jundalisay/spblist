<!-- If drop a stone, why does it fall to the ground?” 

The usual is that it is attracted by the earth. 

Modern physics has a slightly different answer. -->

An action at a distance must have some intermediary medium. 
<!-- As a result of the more careful study
of electromagnetic phenomena, we have come to
regard action at a distance as a process impossible
without the intervention of 
medium.  -->

According to Faraday, a magnet attracts a piece of iron not through the medium of empty space, but through the medium of a magnetic field*. 

This magnetic field is always around the magnet. It operates on the piece of iron, so that the iron moves towards the magnet.


{{< n n="In Cartesian Physics, the magentic field is a combined effect of Electromagnetism, Matter, and Spacetime, with Spacetime being the true medium. A magnet attract the iron really eliminates the spacetime between them. A magnet that repels another magnet really creates space between them." >}}



This idea is arbitrary. Nevertheless, it represents electromagnetic phenomena and is applied to the transmission of electromagnetic waves.

**The effects of gravitation is analogous to the effects of magnetism.**

 <!-- also are regarded in an analogous manner. -->
The action of the earth on a falling stone happens indirectly. 
- The earth produces a gravitational field around itself which acts on the stone and causes it to fall. 
- The intensity of this diminishes according to a definite law as we move farther away from the earth. 

From our point of view this means that **the law governing the gravitational field in space must be perfectly definite**. 

<!-- , in order correctly to represent the diminution of gravitational action with the distance from operative bodies.  -->

The earth produces a field in its immediate neighbourhood directly. {{< c v="red" >}} The field's intensity and direction at farther areas are thence determined by the law which governs the properties of **the space** of the gravitational fields themselves.{{< /c >}}

In contrast to electric and magnetic fields, **the gravitational field makes bodies accelerate.** This is of fundamental importance. 
- **This acceleration does not depend at all on that body's material or its physical state**. A piece of lead and a piece of wood fall in exactly the same way*. <!-- manner in a
gravitational field (in vacuo), when they start off from rest or with the same initial velocity.  -->


{{< n n="It only depends on their Nature as Matter (as opposed to Electromagnetic Nature like light or electrons)" >}}

<!-- exhibits a most remarkable property, which is of fundamental importance for what follows.  -->  <!-- Bodies solely affected by the influence of gravity accelerate. --> 

<!-- This law, which holds most accurately, can be expressed in a different form in the light of the following consideration. -->

According to Newton’s 2nd law of motion, this is:

``` elixir
Force = inertial mass × acceleration
```


The “inertial mass” is a characteristic constant [g] of the accelerated body.

If gravity caused the acceleration, we then have:

``` elixir
Force = gravitational mass × intensity of the gravitational field
```

The “gravitational mass”* is also a characteristic constant [G] for the body. 


{{< n n="Here, Einstein subtly hacks Newton by converting his 'mass' into 'gravitational  mass'. This is in order to make room for his new idea which he calls 'inertial mass' which in Superphysics is 'electromagnetic potential'" >}}


From these, 2 relations follows:

``` elixir
acceleration = (gravitational mass / inertial mass) × intensity of the gravitational field
```


<!-- If the acceleration were independent of the nature of the body and always the same for a given gravitational field, then the ratio of the gravitational to the inertial mass must likewise be the same for all bodies.  -->

<!-- We then make both types of mass the same as a law:  -->
<!--  By a suitable choice of units we can thus make this ratio equal to unity. We then have the following law=  -->

<!-- The gravitational mass of a body is equal to its inertial mass.

This means that weight is inertia and vice versa.  -->

<!-- It is true that this important law had hitherto been recorded in mechanics, but it had not been interpreted. A satisfactory interpretation can be obtained only if we recognise the following fact=  The same quality of a body manifests itself according to circumstances as “inertia” or as “weight” (lit. “heaviness”).  -->


The ratio of the gravitational to the inertial mass is likewise the same for all bodies if there is no acceleration.

<!--  the acceleration of a body is:
- independent of the nature and the condition of the body
- always the same for a given gravitational field -->

Through a common unit, this ratio becomes equal. 

This leads to the following law: 

{{< q a="Einstein" >}}
The gravitational mass of a body is equal to its inertial mass.
{{< /q >}}

This important law is already in mechanics. But it had not been interpreted*. 


{{< n n="Inertia in rest mass is gravity. It had not been interpreted because no one would be crazy to assign the cause of gravity to electromagnetism. Even in Cartesian Physics, the cause of gravity is Spacetime and not Matter." >}}


I interpret it as: The inertia of body is its weight. 

This is connected to General Relativity. 

<!-- A satisfactory interpretation can be
obtained only if we recognise the following fact:

The same quality of a body manifests itself according to circumstances as “inertia” or as
“weight” (lit. “heaviness”). 

In the following section we shall show to what extent this is
actually the case, and how this question is con-
nected with the general postulate of relativity. -->
