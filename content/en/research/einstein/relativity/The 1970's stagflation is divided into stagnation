The 1970's stagflation is divided into stagnation and inflation. 



The inflation clearly is here. The stagnation is just waiting for the Iran and China wars.

The Eastern social cycle theory explains how we connected the crisis patterns from Adam Smith's time to the current crisis forming an unbroken, predictable chain of recurring crises rooted in the same causes: "For the coming crisis, Adam Smith clearly points to the invention of money and commercial paper instruments as the cause, as it allows value to be controlled by a few people which then starves the rest."

So the cause is the greed that breeds in those-who-live-by-profits. Ideally, the 2 other classes (those-who-live-by-wages and those-who-live-by-rent-or-taxes should be able to correct them). But we find that those-who-live-by-profits have prevented this by teaching the idea that profit is a moral good. This is known as profit maximization which Smith actually bashed.

We define the aether as the substance of abstract ideas, feelings, and minds. I suggest your read Spinoza who expanded on Cartesian Philosophy. So if the aether doesn't exist then you never had any ideas and, moreover, you don't exist unless you are a bot that works under electromagnetism and no aether. AI is dumb because it is only electromagnetic and not aethereal. We do have a research prosposal to let AI tap into the aether to make it sentient.
