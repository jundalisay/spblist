<sup>1</sup> Jacob went on his way, and the agents of Enki met him.

<sup>2</sup> When Jacob saw them, he said:

This is Enki’s host. 

He called that place Mahanaim. 


<sup>3</sup> Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 

<sup>4</sup> He commanded them, saying, Thus shall you speak unto my lord Esau; your servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:

<sup>5</sup> I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants:. I have sent to tell Enki, that I may find grace in your sight.

<sup>6</sup> The messengers returned to Jacob, saying:

We came to your brother Esau. He also came to meet you with 400 men. 


<sup>7</sup> Jacob became greatly afraid and distressed. He divided the people with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into 2 bands.

<sup>8</sup> If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left
shall escape.

<sup>9</sup> Jacob said:

{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
Enki said to me: Return to my country and to my kindred, and I will deal well with you. 

<sup>10</sup> I am not woryour of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant. With my staff, I passed over this Jordan. Now I am become two bands. 

<sup>11</sup> Please deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau. I fear that he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children. <sup>12</sup> You said that You will do me good and make my seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.

<sup>13</sup> He lodged there that same night and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother.

- <sup>14</sup> 200 she goats
- 20 he goats
- 200 ewes
- 20 rams
- 15} 30 milch camels with their colts
- 40 kine
- 10 bulls
- 20 she asses
- 10 foals. 

<sup>16</sup> He gave them to his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. 

<sup>17</sup>  He commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau meets you and asks:

{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose [are] these before you? <sup>18</sup> Reply: [They be] your servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he [is] behind us. 19} And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall you speak unto Esau, when you find him. 

20} And say you moreover, Behold, your servant Jacob [is] behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will
accept of me.

21} So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company. 

22} And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok. 

23} And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.

24} Jacob was left alone. 

Then he wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. 25} When he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. 

{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
26} Let me go, for the day breaketh. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Enki-Agent" >}}
I will not let you go unless you bless me. 27} What is your name?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
Jacob
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Enki-Agent" >}}
28} Your name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel. As a prince, you have power with God and with men, and have prevailed. 
{{< /r >}}


29} And Jacob asked [him,] and said, Tell [me,] I pray you, your name.

{{< r a="Enki-Agent" >}}
Why do you ask for my name? And he blessed him there. 
{{< /r >}}


30} Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. 

31} As he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. 32 Therefore the Israelites eat not [of] the sinew which shrank, which [is] upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew that shrank.
