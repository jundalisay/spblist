<sup>1</sup> Adam had sex with Eve his wife. She conceived and gave birth to Cain.

{{< r a="Eve" >}}
I have gotten a man from Enlil.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>2</sup> She again gave birth to his brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

<sup>3</sup> In time, Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering for Enlil. 

<sup>4</sup> Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof.

Enlil had respect for Abel and his offering, <sup>5</sup> but not for Cain and his offering. This made Cain very angry. He looked despondent. 

<sup>6</sup> Enlil said to Cain:

{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
Why are you angry? Why do you look despondent? <sup>7</sup> If you do [your offering] well, then you will be accepted. If not, then sin is at the door. Its desire is for you, but you must overcome it.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>8</sup> Cain talked with Abel. When they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel and slew him.

<sup>9</sup> Enlil asked Cain where Abel is. He said:

{{< r a="Cain" >}}
I do not know: Am I my brother’s keeper? 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
<sup>10</sup> What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cried to me from the ground. <sup>11</sup> Now you are cursed from the earth, which had opened her mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. <sup>12</sup> When you till the ground, it shall not yield to you her strength. You will be a fugitive and vagabond on the earth. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Cain" >}}
<sup>13</sup> My punishment is greater than I can bear. <sup>14</sup> You have driven me out this day from the face of the earth. From your face I shall be hidden. I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth. Every one that finds me shall slay me.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
<sup>15</sup> Whoever slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.
{{< /l >}}

Enlil set a mark upon Cain, lest anyone finding him should kill him.

<sup>16</sup> So Cain went out from the presence of Enki, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. 

<sup>17</sup> Cain had sex with his wife and she conceived Enoch. Cain built a city named Enoch after his son. 
<!-- 
{4:18} And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and
Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.

{4:19} And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name
of the one [was] Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

{4:20} And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as
dwell in tents, and [of such as have] cattle. {4:21} And his
brother’s name [was] Jubal: he was the father of all such as
handle the harp and organ. {4:22} And Zillah, she also bare
Tubal- cain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron:
and the sister of Tubal-cain [was] Naamah. {4:23} And
Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my
voice; you wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I
have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my
hurt. {4:24} If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.


{4:25} Adam had sex with his wife again. She bore a son, Seth.


r a="Eve" 
Enlil had appointed me another seed to replace Abel, whom Cain slew.

<!-- 
{4:26} Seth later had a son named Enos. 

{5:1} This [is] the book of the generations of Adam. In
the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made
he him; {5:2} Male and female created he them; and
blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when
they were created.

{5:3} Adam lived 130 years, and
begat [a son] in his own likeness, after his image; and called
his name Seth: 

{5:4} And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were 800 years.

He begat sons and daughters: {5:5} And all the days that Adam lived were
nine hundred and thirty years: and he died. 

{5:6} Seth lived 105 years, and begat Enos: 

{5:7} Seth lived after he begat Enos 807 years, and begat sons and daughters: 

{5:8} All the days of Seth were 912 years: and he died.

{5:9} Enos lived 90 years, and begat Cainan:

{5:10} Enos lived after he begat Cainan 815 years, and begat sons and daughters: 

{5:11} And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and
he died.

{5:12} And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel: 

{5:13} And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel 840 years, and begat sons and daughters: 

{5:14} And all the days of Cainan were 910 years: and he died. -->
