<sup>1</sup> Men began to multiply and daughters were born unto them.

<sup>2</sup> The sons of Enlil saw that the daughters of men were fair. So they took them as wives.


{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
<sup>3</sup> My spirit shall not always remain with man, for they are corrupt. Their days shall
be 120 years. 
{{< /l >}}


<sup>4</sup> There were Nephilim giants on the earth in those days. After the sons of Enlil had sex with the daughters of men, they bare children to them. Those children became the mighty, famous men of old.

<sup>5</sup> Enlil saw that the wickedness of man was great on earth, and that man was continually thinkin of evil. <sup>6</sup> Enlil regretted that he had made man.


{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
<sup>7</sup> I will destroy both man, beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air. I regret to  have made them.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>8</sup> But Noah found grace with Enki.

<!-- <sup>9</sup> These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man [and] perfect in his generations, [and] Noah walked with God. 

{6:10} And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 

{6:11} The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 

{6:12} Enlil looked at the earth and saw that it was corrupt. For all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.  -->

<sup>13</sup> Enki said unto Noah:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
The end of all flesh is come before me. The earth is filled with violence through them, so Enlil will destroy them with the earth.
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>14</sup> Make an ark of gopher wood with rooms, pitch it within and without with pitch. <sup>15</sup> The length of the ark shall be 300 cubits, the width 50 cubits, and height 30 cubits. <sup>16</sup> A window shalt you make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt you finish it above. The door of the ark shalt will be on the side with a lower, second, and third story. 

<sup>17</sup> Enlil will bring a flood on the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven. Every thing that is in the earth shall die. <sup>18</sup> But with you will I establish my covenant. You with your sons, their wives and your wife will come into the ark. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>19</sup> And of every living thing of all flesh, 2 of every [sort] shalt you bring into the ark, to keep [them] alive with you; they shall be male and female.

<sup>20</sup> Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, 2 of every [sort] shall come unto you, to keep [them] alive.

<sup>21</sup> Take all the food that you can as it shall be for food for you and for them.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>22</sup> Thus did Noah according to all that Enki commanded him.
