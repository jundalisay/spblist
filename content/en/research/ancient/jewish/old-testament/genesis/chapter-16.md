<sup>1</sup> Sarai bare no children. She had an Egyptian servant named Hagar.

<sup>2</sup> Sarai told Abram:

Enki had restrained me from bearing: Please have sex with my maid so you can have a child by her.

Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. 

<sup>3</sup> Sarai took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.

<sup>4</sup> He had sex with Hagar and she conceived. Sarai then despised Hagar. 

<sup>5</sup> Sarai said to Abram:

I made a mistake. I have given my maid to you. When she saw that she had conceived, she despised me. May Enki judge between you and me.

<sup>6</sup> But Abram said unto Sarai, Your servant is in your hand. Do whatever you want with her. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.

<sup>7</sup> A worker for Enki found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. <sup>8</sup> He said, 

{{< l a="Enki-Agent" >}}
Hagar where are you going? 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Hagar" >}}
I flee from Sarai. 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Enki-Agent" >}}
<sup>9</sup> Return to Sarai and submit yourself to her authority. {16:10} I will multiply your offspring exceedingly, that they will be innumerable. {16:11} You are pregnant with a son who will be named Ishmael because Enki had heard your affliction. {16:12} He will be a wild man; his hand [will be] against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Hagar" >}}
<sup>13</sup> I will call you El-roi. Here, I have seen the one who sees me.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>14</sup> And so that well was called Beer-lahai-roi, between Kadesh and Bered.

<sup>15</sup> Hagar bare Abram a son which he named Ishmael.

<sup>16</sup> Abram was 86 years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.
