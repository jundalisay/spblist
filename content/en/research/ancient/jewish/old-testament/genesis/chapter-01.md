<sup>1</sup> In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. <sup>2</sup> The earth was without form, and void. Darkness was upon the face of the deep. The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

<sup>3</sup> God said, Let there be light: and there was light. <sup>4</sup> God saw the light, that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness.

<sup>5</sup> God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.  The evening and the morning were the first day. 

<sup>6</sup> God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

<sup>7</sup> God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.

<sup>8</sup> God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.

<sup>9</sup> God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.

<sup>10</sup> God called the dry land Earth. The gathering together of the waters He called Seas: and God saw that it was good.

<sup>11</sup> God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

<sup>12</sup> The earth brought forth grass, [and] herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed [was] in itself, after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good. 

<sup>13</sup> The evening and the morning were the third day.

<sup>14</sup> God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: {1:15} And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 

{1:16} And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also. {1:17} And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, {1:18} And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that [it was] good. {1:19} 

The evening and the morning were the fourth day. {1:20} And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl [that] may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. {1:21} And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good. {1:22} 

God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let
fowl multiply in the earth. {1:23} And the evening and the
morning were the fifth day.
