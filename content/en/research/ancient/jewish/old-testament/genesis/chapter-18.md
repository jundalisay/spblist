<sup>1</sup> Enki appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre while he was sitting in the tent door in the heat of the day.

<sup>2</sup> 3 men stood by Enki. So Abraham ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground <sup>3</sup> and said:

{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
My Lord, if now I have found favour in your sight, pass not away, I pray you, from your
servant: <sup>4</sup> Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.

<sup>5</sup> I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort you your hearts; after that you shall pass on: for therefore are you come to your servant.
{{< /l >}}


They said: Yes please.

<sup>6</sup> Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said:

{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
Make ready quickly 3 measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth. 
{{< /l >}}

<sup>7</sup> Abraham ran to the herd and fetched a tender and good calf and gave it to a young man who hasted to dress it. 

<sup>8</sup> He took butter and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set [it] before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.

<sup>9</sup> They said to him:

{{< l a="Enki-Agents" >}}
Where is Sarah your wife?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Abraham" >}}
In the tent
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Enki-Agents" >}}
{18:10} I will return to you after 1 year and Sarah shall have a son.
{{< /l >}}


Sarah heard [it] in the tent door, which [was] behind him. 

<sup>11</sup> Abraham and Sarah [were] old [and] well stricken in age; [and] it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

<sup>12</sup> So Sarah laughed saying: 

{{< r a="Sarah" >}}
After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? 
{{< /r >}}


<sup>13</sup> Enki asked Abraham:


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? 

{18:14} Is any thing too hard for Enki? At the time appointed I will return unto you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>15</sup> Then Sarah denied, saying:

No I didn't laugh


She was afraid. 

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
You laughed. 
{{< /l >}}

{18:16} The men rose up and looked towards Sodom. Abraham went with them to bring them
on the way. 


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>17</sup> Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do. <sup>18</sup> Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?  

<sup>19</sup> For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of Enki, to do justice and judgment; that Enki may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.

<sup>20</sup> The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great. Their sin is very grievous. <sup>21</sup> I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come
unto me; and if not, I will know.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>22</sup> The men went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Enki. 

<sup>23</sup> Abraham drew near and said:

{{< r a="Abraham" >}}
Will you also destroy the righteous with the wicked? 

<sup>24</sup> There are 50 righteous within the city: will you also destroy and not spare the place for the 50 righteous? 

<sup>25</sup> That be far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from you: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>26</sup> If I find in Sodom 50 righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. 
{{< /l >}}


<!-- {18:27} And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken
upon me to speak unto the Lord, which [am but] dust and
ashes: {18:28}  -->


{{< r a="Abraham" >}}
Suppose there are only 45 righteous. Will you destroy all the city for [lack of] five?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Abraham" >}}
<sup>29</sup> If there are 40 found there?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
I will not do [it] for forty’s sake.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Abraham" >}}
<sup>30</sup> Please do not be angry: if 30 shall be found there?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
I will not do [it,] if I find thirty there.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Abraham" >}}
{18:31} If there shall be 20 found there?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
I will not destroy [it] for twenty’s sake.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Abraham" >}}
<sup>32</sup> Oh please do not be angry: if 10 shall be found there?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
I will not destroy [it] for ten’s sake.
{{< /l >}}


{18:33} Enki went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.
