<sup>1</sup> Jacob saw Esau coming with 400 men.

Jacob divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the 2 handmaids. 

<sup>2</sup> He put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 

<sup>3</sup> He passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground 7 times, until he came near to his brother. 

<sup>4</sup> Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept. 

<sup>5</sup> He saw the women and the children and said:

{{< r a="Esau" >}}
Who are those with you?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
The children which Enki had graciously given your servant. 6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves. 
{{< /l >}}


<sup>7</sup> Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves. 


<sup>8</sup> He said:

What [meanest] you by all this drove which I met?

And he said, [These are] to find grace in the sight of my lord. 9} And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; 

keep that you hast unto yourself. 


{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
10 Nay, I pray you, if now I have found grace in your sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen your
face, as though I had seen the face of God, and you wast pleased with me. 

11} Take, I pray you, my blessing that is brought to you; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. 
{{< /l >}}


He urged him, and he took [it. ]

12 He said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you. 13} And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children [are] tender, and the flocks and herds with young [are] with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.


14} Let my lord, I pray you, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.

{{< r a="Esau" >}}
15 Let me now leave with you [some] of the folk that [are] with me. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
What needs it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.
{{< /l >}}


1} So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.

17 Jacob went to Succoth and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.

18 Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city.

19 He bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechemâ€™s father, for 100 pieces of money. 

20 He erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel.
