<sup>1</sup> Abraham went from there towards the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. 

<sup>2</sup> Abraham said of Sarah:

{{< r a="Abraham" >}}
She is my sister. Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. 
{{< /r >}}


<sup>3</sup> Enki came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him:

You are a dead man because the woman which you have taken is another man’s wife. 

<sup>4</sup> But Abimelech had not come near her. He said:

Enki, will you slay also a righteous nation?

<sup>5</sup> Said he not unto me, She [is] my sister? and she, even she herself said, He [is] my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.

<sup>6</sup> Enki said to him in a dream:

I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart. For I also withheld you from sinning against me: therefore suffered I you not to touch her. 

<sup>7</sup> So restore the man his wife; for he [is] a prophet, and he shall pray for you, and you shalt live. If you restore [her] not, know you that you shalt surely die, thou, and all that [are] thine.

<sup>8</sup> Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. 

<sup>9</sup> Then Abimelech called Abraham:

{{< r a="Abimelech" >}}
What have you done unto us? What have I offended you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? you hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. 

<sup>10</sup> What sawest thou, that you hast done this thing?

{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
{20:11} I thought that the fear of Enki is not in this place and that they will slay me for my wife’s sake. {20:12} She is my sister; she [is] the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.  {20:13} Enki caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her:

This is your kindness which you shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He [is] my brother.

{20:14} Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave [them] unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. 

{20:15} Abimelech said:

{{< r a="Abimelech" >}}
My land is before you. Live wherever you want.  {20:16} Sarah, I have given your brother 1,000 pieces of silver. He is to you a covering of the eyes, unto all that [are] with you, and with all [other:].
{{< /r >}}

Thus she was reproved.

{21:9} Sarah saw Ishmael [the son of Hagar the Egyptian] mocking. 

{21:10} So she said to Abraham:

Cast out Hagar and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, [even] with Isaac. {21:11}

The thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son.

{20:17} So Abraham prayed to Enki.

Enki healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants. They bare children.

{20:18} Enki had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife.

{21:1} Enki visited Sarah as he had said, and did unto Sarah as he had spoken.

{21:2} Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time when Enki had spoken to him. 

{21:3} Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. 

{21:4} Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him. 

{21:5} Abraham was 100 years old when his son Isaac was born unto him.
