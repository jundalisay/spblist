<sup>1</sup> Enlil blessed Noah and his sons:

{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. <sup>2</sup> Every beast of the earth will fear you and dread you. Every bird, creature, and fish of the earth will be delivered to your hand. 

<sup>3</sup> Every moving thing that lives shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. <sup>4</sup> But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, you shall not eat. 

<sup>5</sup> Your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man. At the hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man. <sup>6</sup> Whoever sheds man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for man was made in the image of the Anunnaki [God]. 


<sup>7</sup> Be fruitful and multiply. Bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.

 <!-- , and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth [upon] the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they .  -->

<sup>8</sup> Enlil spoke to Noah and to his sons: 

{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
<sup>9</sup> I establish my covenant:
- with you, and with your seed after you
- <sup>10</sup> with every living creature that is with you: fowl, cattle, and every beast of the earth with you, from all that went out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. 

<sup>11</sup> I will establish my covenant with you.

Neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood. Neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
<sup>12</sup> This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 

<sup>13</sup> I set my rainbow in the cloud as a token of a covenant between me and the earth. <sup>14</sup> When I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud.

<sup>15</sup> I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh. There will be no more flood to destroy all flesh.

<sup>16</sup> The rainbow shall be in the cloud. I will look at it so that I may remember the everlasting covenant between me and every living creature of all flesh on the earth.*

{{< n n="The cloud is figurative for the quarantine against humans. The rainbow is the signalfor the quarantine  ">}}


{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
<sup>17</sup> [To Noah:] This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh on the earth.

<sup>18-19</sup>The sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth.

Ham is the father of Canaan. 

<!-- {9:19} These [are] the 3 sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread. -->

<sup>20</sup> Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard. <sup>21</sup> He drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. 

<sup>22</sup> Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his 2 brothers outside. 

<sup>23</sup> Shem and Japheth took a garment, and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.

<sup>24</sup> Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him:

{{< l a="Noah" >}}
<sup>25</sup> Cursed be Canaan. It will be a servant of servants for his brethren. 

<sup>26</sup> Blessed be Enlil of Shem. Canaan shall be his servant. <sup>27</sup> Enlil shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem. Canaan shall be his servant.

<sup>28</sup> Noah lived after the flood 350 years. <sup>29</sup> All the days of Noah were 950 years until he died.
