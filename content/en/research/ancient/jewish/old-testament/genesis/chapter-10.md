{10:1} Now these are the records of Noah's sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth. They had sons after the flood.

{10:2} The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 

{10:3} The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. 

{10:4} The sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

{10:5} By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

{10:6} The sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan. 

{10:7} The sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah.

The sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. 

{10:8} Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. 

{10:9} He was a mighty hunter in the eyes of Enki.

<!-- RD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before Enki.  -->

{10:10} And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Sumer. 

{10:11} Out of that land went forth Asshur, and Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, {10:12} And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same [is] a great city.

{10:13} And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, {10:14} And Pathrusim, and
Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.

{10:15} And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,
{10:16} And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the  Girgasite, {10:17} And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, {10:18} And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. 

{10:19} The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as you comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as you goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. {10:20} These [are]
the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in
their countries, [and] in their nations.

{10:21} Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were [children] born.

{10:22} The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. {10:23} And
the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

{10:24} And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

{10:25} And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one [was] Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brotherâ€™s name [was] Joktan. {10:26} And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazar-maveth, and Jerah, {10:27} And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, {10:28} And
Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, {10:29} And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these [were] the sons of Joktan.

{10:30} And their dwelling was from Mesha, as you goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. {10:31} These [are] the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. 

{10:32} These [are] the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
