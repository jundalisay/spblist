<sup>1</sup> [The serpent] Enki was more subtle than any beast of the field which Enlil had made.

He said unto the woman:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Did Enlil say that you shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Eve" >}}
<sup>2</sup> We may eat any fruit of the trees of the garden.  <sup>3</sup> But Enlil told us not to eat nor touch the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, otherwise you will die. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>4</sup> Surely, you will not die. <sup>5</sup> Enlil knows that the day you eat it, your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as the Annunaki, knowing good and evil.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>6</sup> When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she ate its fruit. She also gave it to her husband with her and he also ate it.

<sup>7</sup> And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked*. They sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.

{{< n n="In yogic tradition, the sense of shame comes from the third chakra. It follows that the fruit raised or upgraded their awareness from the 2nd to the 3rd chakra" >}}

<sup>8</sup> They heard the voice of Enlil walking in the garden in the cool of the day. Adam and his wife hid themselves from Enlil amongst the trees of the garden.

<sup>9</sup> Enlil called unto Adam, and said unto him:

{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
Where are you?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Adam" >}}
<sup>10</sup> I heard your voice in the garden. I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid myself. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
<sup>11</sup> Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree that I commanded you not to eat?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Adam" >}}
<sup>12</sup> The woman whom you gave to be with me gave me the fruit of the tree. So I ate it.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>13</sup> Enlil said to the woman:

{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
What have you done?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Eve" >}}
The serpent Enki beguiled me, so I ate.
{{< /r >}}

Enlil said to Enki:

{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
<sup>14</sup> Because you have done this, you are cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. On your belly you shall go. You shall eat dust all the days of your life. <sup>15</sup> I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed. It shall bruise your head, and you shalt bruise his heel.

### The Original Sin

<sup>16</sup> Enlil said to the woman: 

{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception*. In sorrow you shalt bring forth children. Your desire shall be to your husband. He shall rule over you.
{{< /l >}}

{{< n n="This is a consequence of the upgrade of the 3rd chakra which is located in the navel" >}}

<sup>17</sup> To Adam he said:

{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
You have hearkened unto the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree that I commanded you not to eat. And so cursed is the ground for your sake. In sorrow, you shall eat of it all the days of your life. <sup>18</sup> The ground shall bring you thorns and thistles. You shall eat the herb* of the field. <sup>19</sup> In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until you return to the ground from where you were taken. You are dust and unto dust you shall return.
{{< /l >}}


{{< n n="The upgrade of the 3rd chakra in the navel allowed humans to be omnivores instead of staying as carnivores as Homo erectus. So Enlil's decrees are really from natural consequences of genetic manipulation" >}}

<sup>20</sup> Adam called his wifeâ€™s name Eve because she was the mother of all living.

<sup>21</sup> Enlil made coats of skins, and clothed Adam and Eve.

{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
<sup>22</sup> Behold, the man has become as one of us Annunaki in terms of knowing good and evil. He might take action and eat also from the tree of life and live forever.
{{< /l >}}

 <!-- Lest he put forth his hand, and -->

<sup>23</sup> And so, Enlil sent him away from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. <sup>24</sup> He drove out the man. He placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep them away from the tree of life.
