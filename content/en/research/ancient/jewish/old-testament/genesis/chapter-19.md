<sup>1</sup> Lot sat in the gate of Sodom when 2 agents of Enki entered the city. Lot rose up to meet them:

{{< r a="Lot" >}}
<sup>2</sup> Spend the night in our house. 
{{< /r >}}

<!--  Turn in, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night,
and wash your feet, and you shall rise up early, and go on
your ways.  -->


<!-- l a="Enki-Agent" >}}
No. We will be in the street all night.
/l >}}
 -->

<sup>3</sup> He pressed on them greatly. So they entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.

<sup>4</sup> But before they lay down, the men of the city, [even] the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter: 

<sup>5</sup> They called unto Lot:

{{< r a="Men" >}}
Where are the men which came in with you this night? Bring them out unto us, so that we may have sex with them. 
{{< /r >}}


<sup>6</sup> Lot went out <sup>7</sup>  and said: 

{{< r a="Lot" >}}
I pray you do not so wickedly. <sup>8</sup> I have 2 daughters which have not have sex yet. Let me bring them out to you and do to them whatever your want. But please do nothing to these men. For they are under my protection. 
{{< /r >}}


<sup>9</sup> They said:

Get out of the way! This one came here as an alien but he is acting like a judge. Now will we deal worse with you, than with them.

They came near to break the door. 

<sup>10</sup> But the agents of Enki pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door. 

<sup>11</sup> They blinded the men that were at the door with blindness so that they could not find the door.

<sup>12</sup> The agents said to Lot: 

{{< l a="Enki-Agents" >}}
If you have any family here, bring them out of this place <sup>13</sup> because we will destroy this place. The outcry against them is so great that Enki had sent us to destroy it. 
{{< /l >}}


<sup>14</sup> Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said:

{{< r a="Lot" >}}
Get out of this place. Enki will destroy this city. 
{{< /r >}}



But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law. 


<sup>15</sup> When the morning arose, the agents hastened Lot, saying:

{{< l a="Enki-Agents" >}}
Arise, take your wife, and your 2 daughters which are here; lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>16</sup> While he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters.

Enki being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.

<sup>17</sup> When they had brought them forth abroad, he said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Escape for your life; look not behind you, neither stay you in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest you be consumed. 
{{< /l >}}


<sup>18</sup> Lot said to them:


{{< r a="Lot" >}}
Oh, not so, Enki. <sup>19</sup> Your servant had found grace in your eyes. You have magnified your mercy, which you have showed to me in saving my life. I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die.
<sup>20</sup> This city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, ([is] it not a little one?) and my soul shall live. 
{{< /r >}}

<sup>21</sup> He said to him:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
See, I have accepted you concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which you hast spoken. {19:22} Haste you, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till you be come thither. 
{{< /l >}}


Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. 

{19:23} The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

<sup>24</sup> Then Enki rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire. 

<sup>25</sup> He overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.

<sup>26</sup> But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.

<sup>27</sup> Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before Enki.

<sup>28</sup> He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.

<sup>29</sup> When Enki destroyed the cities of the plain, Enki remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.

<sup>30</sup> Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain with his 2 daughters. For he feared to dwell in Zoar. He dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. 

<sup>31</sup> The firstborn said unto the younger, Our father [is] old, and [there is] not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth: 

<sup>32</sup> Let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

<sup>33</sup> They made their father drink wine that night. 

The firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 

<sup>34</sup> The next day, the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go you in, [and] lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

<sup>35</sup> They made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.

<sup>36</sup> Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. {19:37} And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same [is] the father of the Moabites
unto this day. 

<sup>38</sup> The younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same [is] the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.
