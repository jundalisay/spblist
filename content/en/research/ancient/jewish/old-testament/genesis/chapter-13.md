<sup>1</sup> Abram left Egypt with his wife, Lot, and all that he had, and Lot with him going south.

<sup>2</sup> Abram was very rich in cattle, silver and gold. 

<sup>3</sup> And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai; 

<sup>4</sup> Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there
Abram called on the name of Enki.

<sup>5</sup> Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. 

<sup>6</sup> The land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. 

<sup>7</sup> There was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land. 

<sup>8</sup> Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray you, between me and you, and between my herdmen and your herdmen; for we [be] brethren. 

<sup>9</sup> Is not the whole land before you? 

Separate yourself, I pray you, from me: if you will take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if you depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.

<sup>10</sup> Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it [was] well watered every where, before Enki destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, [even] as the garden of Enki, like the land of Egypt, as you comest unto Zoar. 

<sup>11</sup> Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated
themselves the one from the other. 

<sup>12</sup> Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched [his] tent toward Sodom. 

<sup>13</sup> But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners.

<sup>14</sup> Enki said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are northward, southward, eastward, and westward. <sup>15</sup> All the land which you see, I will give to you and to your seed forever.

<sup>16</sup> I will make your seed as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall your seed also be numbered. 

<sup>17</sup> Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to you. 
{{< /l >}}

<sup>18</sup> Then Abram removed [his] tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar for Enki.
