<sup>1</sup> Enki said to Abram:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Get out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father’s house, unto a land that I will show you. <sup>2</sup> I will make of you a great nation and bless you and make your name great. You shall be a blessing. <sup>3</sup> I will bless them that bless you, and curse him that curse you. All families of the earth shall be blessed and in you.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>4</sup> So Abram departed, as Enki had told him. Lot went with him. Abram was 75 years old when he departed out of Haran. <sup>5</sup> He took Sarai and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran. They went into  Canaan. 

<sup>6</sup> Abram passed through the land called Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh.

 <!-- And the Canaanite [was] then in the land. -->

<sup>7</sup> Enki appeared to Abram, and said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Unto your seed I will give this land. There he built an altar for Enki who appeared to him.
{{< /l >}}


{12:8} And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent,
[having] Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: 

There he built an altar for Enki.

<!-- , and called upon the
name of Enki.  -->

{12:9} And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

{12:10} There was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine [was] grievous in the land.

{12:11} When he was about to enter Egypt, thathe said to Sarai:

{{< l a="Abram" >}}
You are a beautiful woman. {12:12} The Egyptians shall see you. They shall say, This is his
wife. And they will kill me, but they will save you alive. {12:13} Please say that you are my sister so I can live. 
{{< /l >}}

<!-- : that it may be
well with me for your sake; and my soul shall live because of
you. -->

{12:14} When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was very beautiful. {12:15} The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.

{12:16} And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and
menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.

{12:17} Enki plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai. 

{12:18} Pharaoh called Abram:

What have you done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? {12:19} Why did you say that she was your sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold your wife, take [her,] and go your way.

{12:20} And Pharaoh commanded [his] men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.
