<sup>1</sup> Enki said to Noah:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Come you and all your house into the ark. I have seen you righteous before me in this generation. 

<sup>2</sup> Of every clean beast you shalt take by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that [are] not clean by two, the male and his female. <sup>3</sup> Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.

<sup>4</sup> Im 7 days, I will cause rain on the earth 40 days and 40 nights. Every living substance that I have made I will destroy from the face of the earth.

<sup>5</sup> Noah did according unto all that Enki commanded. <sup>6</sup> Noah was 600 years old when the flood hit the earth.

<sup>7</sup> The following went into the ark because of the waters of the flood:
- Noah, his sons, his wife, his sons’ wives
- <sup>8</sup> The clean and unclean beasts
- birds and every thing that creeps on the earth
- <sup>9</sup> two and two, the male and the female, as Enki had commanded Noah. 

<sup>10</sup> After 7 days, the waters of the flood were upon the earth.

<sup>11</sup> In the 600th year of Noah’s life, in month 2, day 17, the fountains of the great deep were broken up and the windows of heaven were opened. 

<sup>12</sup> It rained 40 days and 40 nights.

<!--  {7:13} In the
selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the 3 wives of his sons with them, into the ark; 

{7:14} They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind,
and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after
his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every
sort. {7:15} And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two
and two of all flesh, wherein [is] the breath of life. {7:16}
And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh,
as God had commanded him: and Enki shut him in. -->

<sup>17</sup> The flood was 40 days on the earth. The waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. 

<!-- And  and were increased greatly upon the earth; and -->
<sup>18</sup> The waters prevailed, and the ark went upon the face of the waters. <sup>19</sup> The waters covered all the high hills. 

<sup>20</sup> The waters prevailed  15 cubits upward and the mountains were covered.

<!-- {7:19} And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that
[were] under the whole heaven, were covered. -->

<sup>21</sup> All flesh died: bird, cattle, beast, and every creeping thing and every man.

<sup>22</sup> All in whose nostrils [was] the breath of life, of all that [was] in the dry [land,] died. 

<sup>23</sup> Every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained [alive,] and they that [were] with him in the ark.

<sup>24</sup> The waters prevailed on the earth for 150 days.
