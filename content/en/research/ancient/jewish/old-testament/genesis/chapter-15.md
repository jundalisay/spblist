<sup>1</sup> After these things, Enki came to Abram in a vision, saying:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Fear not, Abram. I am your shield, and your exceeding great reward.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Abram" >}}
<sup>2</sup> What will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?  To me you have given no seed.
{{< /r >}}
<!--  and, lo, one born in my house is mine
heir.  -->

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>4</sup> This shall not be your heir. Your heir shall come forth out of your own bowels. 
{{< /l >}}

<sup>5</sup> He brought him outside and said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Look now towards the stars. Your seed will be as numerous as them. 
{{< /l >}}


<sup>6</sup> Abram believed in Enki. He counted it to him for righteousness. 


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>7</sup> I am Enki who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Abram" >}}
<sup>8</sup> Lord Enki, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>9</sup> Give me a 3 year old calf, and a 3 year old she goat and a ram of 3 years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>10</sup> And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not. 

<sup>11</sup> When the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away. 

<sup>12</sup> When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him. 

<sup>13</sup> Enki said to Abram:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Your seed shall be a foreigner in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them. They shall afflict them 400 years. <sup>14</sup> Also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance. {15:15} You shalt go to your fathers in peace; you shalt be buried in a good old age.

<sup>16</sup> But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of
the Amorites [is] not yet full. 
{{< /l >}}


<sup>17</sup> When the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. 

<sup>28</sup>  In the same day, Enki made a covenant with Abram:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Unto your seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: <sup>19</sup> The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, {15:20} And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, {15:21} And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
