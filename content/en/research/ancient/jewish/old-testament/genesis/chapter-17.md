<sup>1</sup> When Abram was 99 years old, Enki appeared to him:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
I am the Almighty Enki; walk before me and be perfect. <sup>2</sup> I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.  
{{< /l >}}


<sup>3</sup> Abram fell on his face. Enki said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>4</sup> My covenant is with you. You shall be a father of many nations. <sup>5</sup> You will now be called Abraham and not Abram for I made you a father of many nations. <sup>6</sup> I will make you exceeding fruitful. I will make nations of you, and kings shall come out of you. 

<sup>7</sup> I will establish my covenant between you and me and your seed after you in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto you, and to your seed after you.

<sup>8</sup> I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the foreign lands, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession. I will be their God.
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>9</sup> You, and your seed after you in their generations, shall keep my covenant. <sup>10</sup> This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your seed after you. Every
man child among you shall be circumcised. 

<sup>11</sup> You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin. It shall be a token of the covenant between me and you. 

<sup>12</sup> 8 day old boys shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of your seed. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>13</sup> He that is born in your house, and he that is bought with your money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.

<sup>14</sup> The uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.

<sup>15</sup> Sarai's name will be changed to Sarah.

<sup>16</sup> I will bless her, and give you a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be [a mother] of nations; kings of people shall be of her. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Abraham" >}}
<sup>17</sup> Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed:

Shall a child be born unto him that is 100 years old? Shall Sarah, that is 90 years old, bear?

<sup>18</sup> O that Ishmael might live before you!
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>19</sup> Sarah shall bear you a son. You shall call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, [and] with his seed after him. 

<sup>20</sup> I have blessed Ishmael, and will make him fruitful. I will multiply him exceedingly. He shall beget 12 princes. I will make him a great nation. <sup>21</sup> But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto you at this set time in the next year. 
{{< /l >}}


<sup>22</sup> He left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.

<sup>23</sup> Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him. 

<sup>24</sup> Abraham was 99 years old when he was circumcised.

<sup>25</sup> Ishmael was 13 years old, when he was circumcised <sup>28</sup> the same day as Abraham. 

<sup>27</sup> All the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
