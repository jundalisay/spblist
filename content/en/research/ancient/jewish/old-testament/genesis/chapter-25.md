<sup>1</sup> Again Abraham took a wife named Keturah. {25:2} She bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.

<sup>3</sup> Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

<sup>4</sup> The sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these [were] the children of Keturah.

<sup>5</sup> Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.

<sup>6</sup> But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.

<sup>7</sup> These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. 

<sup>8</sup> Abraham died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years and was gathered to his people. 

<sup>9</sup> His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which [is] before Mamre.

<sup>10</sup> The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. 

<sup>11</sup> After the death of Abraham, Enki blessed his son Isaac who then dwelt by the well
Lahai-roi. 

<sup>12-13</sup> The sons of Ishmael are the firstborn Nebajoth and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, <sup>14</sup> Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, <sup>15</sup> Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 

<sup>16</sup> These are the 12 sons of Ishmael.

<!-- , and these [are] their names, by their towns, and by
their castles; twelve princes according to their nations -->.

<sup>17</sup> Ishmael lived for 137 years. {25:18} His people dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt on the way to Assyria. 

<sup>19</sup> Isaac, Abraham’s son was 40 years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian. 

<sup>21</sup> Isaac intreated Enki for his wife, because she was barren and so she conceived.

<sup>22</sup> The children struggled together within her. She said:

If [it be] so, why [am] I thus? And she went to enquire of Enki. 

<sup>23</sup> Enki said to her:

Two nations [are] in your womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from your bowels; and [the one] people shall be stronger than [the other] people; and the elder shall serve the younger.

<sup>24</sup> When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, [there were] twins in her womb. 

<sup>25</sup> The first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. 

<sup>26</sup> After that his brother came out, and his hand took hold on Esau’s heel; and his
name was called Jacob: 

Isaac was 60 years old when she bare them. 

<sup>27</sup> Esau became a cunning hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. 

<sup>28</sup> Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of [his] venison: but Rebekah loved
Jacob.

<sup>29</sup> Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he [was] faint: 

<sup>30</sup> Esau said to Jacob:

{{< r a="Esau" >}}
Feed me with that same red [pottage;] for I [am] faint: therefore was his name called Edom. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
<sup>31</sup> Sell me your birthright today.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Esau" >}}
<sup>32</sup> I am about to die. What profit shall this birthright do to me? 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
<sup>33</sup> Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. 
{{< /l >}}


<sup>34</sup> Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised [his] birthright.
