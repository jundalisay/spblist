<sup>1</sup> In year 10, month 10, day 12 the word of Enki came to me, saying:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
2 Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt.

3 Say: Enki says: Behold, I [am] against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river [is] mine own, and I have made [it] for myself.
{{< /l >}}


4 But I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will cause the fish of your rivers to stick unto your scales, and I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, and all the fish of your rivers shall stick unto your scales. 

5 I will leave you [thrown] into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers: you shalt fall upon the open fields; you shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given you for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven. 

6 All the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I [am] Enki, because they have been a staff of reed to the Israelites. 

7 When they took hold of you by your hand, you didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon you, you brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.

8} Therefore thus saith Enki; Behold, I will bring a sword upon you, and cut off man and beast out of you. 9} And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I [am] Enki: because he hath said, The river [is] mine, and I have made [it. ]


10 Behold, therefore I [am] against you, and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste [and] desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.

11} No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years. 12} And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries [that are] desolate, and her cities among the cities [that are] laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.

13} Yet thus saith Enki; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered: 14} And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return [into] the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom. 15} It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations. 16} And it shall be no more the confidence of the Israelites, which bringeth [their] iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I [am] Enki.

17} And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first [month,] in the first [day] of the month, the word of Enki came unto me, saying, 18} Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head [was] made bald, and every shoulder [was] peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it: 19} Therefore thus saith Enki; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army. 20} I have given him the land of Egypt [for] his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith Enki.

21} In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give you the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I [am] Enki.
