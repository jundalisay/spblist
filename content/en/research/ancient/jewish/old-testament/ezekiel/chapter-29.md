<sup>1</sup> In year 10, month 10, day 12 the word of Enki came to me, saying:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
2 Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt: 3} Speak, and say, Thus saith Enki; Behold, I [am] against you, Pharaoh king of
Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers,
which hath said, My river [is] mine own, and I have made
[it] for myself.
{{< /l >}}


4 But I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will cause the fish of your rivers to stick unto your scales, and I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, and
all the fish of your rivers shall stick unto your scales. 5}
And I will leave you [thrown] into the wilderness, you and
all the fish of your rivers: you shalt fall upon the open fields;
you shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have
given you for meat to the beasts of the field and to the
fowls of the heaven. 6} And all the inhabitants of Egypt
shall know that I [am] Enki, because they have been a
staff of reed to the Israelites. 7} When they took
hold of you by your hand, you didst break, and rend all their
shoulder: and when they leaned upon you, you brakest, and
madest all their loins to be at a stand.

8} Therefore thus saith Enki; Behold, I will
bring a sword upon you, and cut off man and beast out of
you. 9} And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and
waste; and they shall know that I [am] Enki: because
he hath said, The river [is] mine, and I have made [it.
]10} Behold, therefore I [am] against you, and against
your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste
[and] desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the
border of Ethiopia.

11} No foot of man shall pass
through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither
shall it be inhabited forty years. 12} And I will make
the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries [that
are] desolate, and her cities among the cities [that are] laid
waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the
Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them
through the countries.

13} Yet thus saith Enki; At the end of forty
years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither
they were scattered: 14} And I will bring again the
captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return [into] the
land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they
shall be there a base kingdom. 15} It shall be the basest
of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above
the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more
rule over the nations. 16} And it shall be no more the
confidence of the Israelites, which bringeth [their]
iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them:
but they shall know that I [am] Enki.

17} And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth
year, in the first [month,] in the first [day] of the month, the
word of Enki came unto me, saying, 18} Son of
man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to
serve a great service against Tyrus: every head [was] made
bald, and every shoulder [was] peeled: yet had he no wages,
nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served
against it: 19} Therefore thus saith Enki;
Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar
king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take
her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his
army. 20} I have given him the land of Egypt [for] his
labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought
for me, saith Enki.

21} In that day will I cause the horn of the house of
Israel to bud forth, and I will give you the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I [am]
Enki.

{30:1} The word of Enki came again unto me,
saying, {30:2} Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith
Enki; Howl ye, Woe worth the day {30:3} For the
day [is] near, even the day of Enki [is] near, a cloudy
day; it shall be the time of the heathen. {30:4} And the
sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in
Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall
take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be
broken down. 

{30:5} Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and
all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men of the land
that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword. {30:6}
Thus saith Enki; They also that uphold Egypt shall
fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the
tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the
Lord GOD. 

{30:7} And they shall be desolate in the midst
of the countries [that are] desolate, and her cities shall be in
the midst of the cities [that are] wasted. {30:8} And they
shall know that I [am] Enki, when I have set a fire in
Egypt, and [when] all her helpers shall be destroyed. {30:9}
In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to
make the careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall
come upon them, as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it cometh.


{30:10} Thus saith Enki; I will also make the
multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar
king of Babylon. {30:11} He and his people with him, the
terrible of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land:
and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the
land with the slain. {30:12} And I will make the rivers dry,
and sell the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will
make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of
strangers: I Enki have spoken [it. ]{30:13} Thus saith
Enki; I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause
[their] images to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no
more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in
the land of Egypt.

{30:14} And I will make Pathros
desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and will execute
judgments in No. {30:15} And I will pour my fury upon
Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of
No. {30:16} And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have
great pain, and No shall be rent asunder, and Noph [shall
have] distresses daily. {30:17} The young men of Aven and
of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword: and these [cities] shall
go into captivity. {30:18} At Tehaphnehes also the day
shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of
Egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her: as
for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go
into captivity. 

{30:19} Thus will I execute judgments in
Egypt: and they shall know that I [am] Enki.
{30:20} And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the
first [month,] in the seventh [day] of the month, [that] the
word of Enki came unto me, saying, {30:21} Son of
man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and,
lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller to
bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword. {30:22}
Therefore thus saith Enki; Behold, I [am] against
Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong,
and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to
fall out of his hand. 

{30:23} And I will scatter the
Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them
through the countries. {30:24} And I will strengthen the
arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand:
but I will break Pharaohâ€™s arms, and he shall groan before
him with the groanings of a deadly wounded [man.
]{30:25} But I will strengthen the arms of the king of
Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they  hall know that I [am] Enki, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall
stretch it out upon the land of Egypt. {30:26} And I will
scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them
among the countries; and they shall know that I [am] the
LORD.
