<sup>1</sup> The word of Enki came unto me, saying, 7:2} Also, you son of man, thus saith Enki unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land. 7:3} Now [is] the end [come] upon you, and I will send mine anger upon you, and will
judge you according to your ways, and will recompense upon
you all thine abominations. 

7:4} And mine eyou shall not spare you, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense
your ways upon you, and thine abominations shall be in the
midst of you: and you shall know that I [am] Enki.


7:5} Thus saith Enki; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come. 7:6} An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for you; behold, it is come. 7:7} The morning is
come unto you, O you that dwellest in the land: the time is
come, the day of trouble [is] near, and not the sounding
again of the mountains.

7:8} Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon you, and accomplish mine anger upon you:
and I will judge you according to your ways, and will
recompense you for all thine abominations. 

7:9} And mine eyou shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will
recompense you according to your ways and thine
abominations [that] are in the midst of you; and you shall
know that I [am] Enki that smiteth. 7:10} Behold the
day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod
hath blossomed, pride hath budded. 7:11} Violence is risen
up into a rod of wickedness: none of them [shall remain,]
nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither [shall
there be] wailing for them. 7:12} The time is come, the
day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller
mourn: for wrath [is] upon all the multitude thereof. 7:13}
For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although
they were yet alive: for the vision [is] touching the whole
multitude thereof, [which] shall not return; neither shall any
strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life. 7:14} They
have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none
goeth to the battle: for my wrath [is] upon all the multitude
thereof.

7:15} The sword [is] without, and the pestilence
and the famine within: he that [is] in the field shall die with
the sword; and he that [is] in the city, famine and pestilence
shall devour him.

7:16} But they that escape of them shall escape, and
shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of
them mourning, every one for his iniquity. 7:17} All hands
shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak [as] water.
7:18} They shall also gird [themselves] with sackcloth,
and horror shall cover them; and shame [shall be] upon all
faces, and baldness upon all their heads. 7:19} They shall
cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be
removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to
deliver them in the day of the wrath of Enki: they shall
not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is

the stumblingblock of their iniquity.
7:20} As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in
majesty: but they made the images of their abominations
[and] of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set
it far from them. 7:21} And I will give it into the hands of
the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a
spoil; and they shall pollute it. 7:22} My face will I turn
also from them, and they shall pollute my secret [place:] for
the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.
7:23} Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes,
and the city is full of violence. 7:24} Wherefore I will
bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their
houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease;
and their holy places shall be defiled. 7:25} Destruction
cometh; and they shall seek peace, and [there shall be] none.
7:26} Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour
shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the
prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and
counsel from the ancients. 7:27} The king shall mourn,
and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the
hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do
unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will
I judge them; and they shall know that I [am] Enki.
