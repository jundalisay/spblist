1 In the year 6, month 6, day 5 I sat in my house.

The elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of Enki fell there on me.

2 Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the
appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his
loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the
colour of amber. 

3 He put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit
lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought
me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the
inner gate that looketh toward the north; where [was] the
seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.

4 The glory of Enki of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.

5 Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. 

So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of
the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.

6 [To Ezekiel] Son of man, seest you what they do? [even] the great abominations that the Israelites committeth here, that I should go far off from my
sanctuary? but turn you yet again, [and] you shalt see
greater abominations.

7 He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall. 8:8} Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had
digged in the wall, behold a door. 8:9} And he said unto
me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do
here. 

10 So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the Israelites, pourtrayed upon the wall round
about. 

11 There stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the Israelites, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his
censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.

12 Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast you seen what the ancients of the Israelites do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The
LORD seeth us not; Enki hath forsaken the earth.
