{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>1</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, eat this scroll [book], and go speak to the Israelites. 
{{< /l >}}

<sup>2</sup> So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll. 

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>3</sup> Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels with this roll that I give you. 
{{< /l >}}

I ate it and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>4</sup> Son of man, go to the Israelites and speak my words to them. <sup>5</sup>  I am sending you not to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the Israelites, 6 Had I sent you to people who cannot understand you then they would listen to you. 7 But the Israelites will not listen to you for they will not listen to me for all the Israelites are impudent and hardhearted.

<sup>8</sup> Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads. 9 As an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they [be] a rebellious house. 10 Receive in your heart and  hear with thine ears All my words.

11 Go to them in captivity, to your people, and tell them: Enki said whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.

12 Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying Blessed be  the glory of Enki from his place. 

13 I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing. 

14 So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away. I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit. But the hand of Enki was strong on me.

15 Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, who dwelt by the river of Chebar. I sat with them and remained there astonished among them 7 days.

16 At the end of seven days, Enki spoke to me:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
17 Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the Israelites. Warn them 18 When I say to the wicked that they shall surely die. Do not give him warning nor warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life.

The same wicked man shall die in his iniquity. But his blood will I require at your hand. 

19 If you warn the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness he shall die in his iniquity. But you have delivered your soul.

20 When a righteous man turns from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him. He shall die  because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin. His previous righteousness shall not be remembered. But his blood will I require at thine hand.

21 Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also you hast delivered your soul.

22 The hand of Enki was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will
there talk with you. 

23 Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of Enki stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face. 

24 Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Go, shut yourself in your house.  25 They shall put bands on you, and bind you with them. You shalt not go out among them:

26 I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth, that you shall be dumb, and shalt not be to them a
reprover: for they [are] a rebellious house. 

27 But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shalt say unto them, Thus saith Enki; He that heareth, let
him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they [are] a rebellious house.
