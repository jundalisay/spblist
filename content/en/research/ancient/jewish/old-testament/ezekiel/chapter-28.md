1-2 [To Ezekiel] Son of man, tell the prince of Tyrus that Enki said that his heart is arrogant and he has said that he is a God and sit in the seat of God in the midst of the seas. Yet he is a man, not God. He has set his heart as the heart of God. 3 He is wiser than Daniel. There is no secret that they can hide from him. 4 With his wisdom and understanding he has gotten riches, gold and silver as treasures. 5 By his great wisdom and traffic his riches have increased, and his heart is made arrogant by his riches.

<!-- Because you hast set thine heart as the heart of God; -->
6-7 And so I will bring terrible foreigners to him. They shall draw their swords against the beauty
of his wisdom and defile his brightness. 8 They shall bring him down to the pit, and you shalt die the deaths of [them that are] slain in the midst of the seas. 9} Wilt you yet say before him that slayeth you, I [am] God? but you [shalt be] a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth you. 10} Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have
spoken [it,]

11-12 Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith Enki; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. 13} Thou
hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone
[was] your covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the
beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald,
and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of your tabrets
and of your pipes was prepared in you in the day that thou
wast created. 

14} Thou [art] the anointed cherub that
covereth; and I have set you [so:] you wast upon the holy
mountain of God; you hast walked up and down in the
midst of the stones of fire. 15} Thou [wast] perfect in
your ways from the day that you wast created, till iniquity
was found in you. 16} By the multitude of your
merchandise they have filled the midst of you with
violence, and you hast sinned: therefore I will cast you as
profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy you,
O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
17} Thine heart was lifted up because of your beauty,
you hast corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness:
I will cast you to the ground, I will lay you before kings,
that they may behold you. 18} Thou hast defiled your
sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the
iniquity of your traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire
from the midst of you, it shall devour you, and I will bring
you to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that
behold you. 19} All they that know you among the
people shall be astonished at you: you shalt be a terror, and
never [shalt] you [be] any more.


20} Again the word of Enki came unto me,
saying, 21} Son of man, set your face against Zidon, and
prophesy against it, 22} And say, Thus saith the Lord
GOD; Behold, I [am] against you, O Zidon; and I will be
glorified in the midst of you: and they shall know that I
[am] Enki, when I shall have executed judgments in
her, and shall be sanctified in her. 23} For I will send
into her pestilence, and blood into her street; and the
wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword
upon her on every side; and they shall know that I [am] the
LORD. 

24} And there shall be no more a pricking brier
unto the Israelites, nor [any] grieving thorn of all [that
are] round about them, that despised them; and they shall
know that I [am] Enki. 25} Thus saith the
Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the Israelites
from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall
be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall
they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant
Jacob. 26} And they shall dwell safely therein, and
shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall
dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments
upon all those that despise them round about them; and they
shall know that I [am] Enki their God.
