<sup>1-2</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, set your face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it, 3} And say unto it, Thus saith Enki; Behold, O mount Seir, I [am] against you, and I will stretch out mine hand against you, and I will
make you most desolate. 4} I will lay your cities waste, and you shalt be desolate, and you shalt know that I [am]
Enki.

5} Because you hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed [the blood of] the Israelites by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end.

6 Therefore, as I live, I will prepare you to blood, and blood shall pursue you: sith you hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue you. 

7} Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth. 8} And I will fill his mountains with his slain [men:] in your hills, and in your valleys, and in all your rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword. 

9} I will make you perpetual desolations, and your cities shall not return: and you shall
know that I [am] Enki. 10} Because you hast
said, These two nations and these two countries shall be
mine, and we will possess it; whereas Enki was there:

11} Therefore, as I live, saith Enki, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine
envy which you hast used out of your hatred against them;
and I will make myself known among them, when I have
judged you. 12} And you shalt know that I [am] the LORD, [and that] I have heard all your blasphemies which
you hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.
13} Thus with your mouth you have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard
[them. ]

14} Thus saith Enki; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make you desolate. 15} As you didst rejoice at the inheritance of the Israelites, because it was desolate, so will I do unto you: you shalt be
desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, [even] all of it: and they shall know that I [am] Enki.
