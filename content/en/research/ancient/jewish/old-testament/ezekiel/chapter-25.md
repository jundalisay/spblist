<sup>1-2</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them; 3} Tell the Ammonites, Hear the word of Enki; Thus saith Enki; Because you saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of
Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah,
when they went into captivity; 4} Behold, therefore I
will deliver you to the men of the east for a possession, and
they shall set their palaces in you, and make their dwellings
in you: they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your
milk.

5} And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels,
and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and you shall
know that I [am] Enki. 6} For thus saith the Lord
GOD; Because you hast clapped [thine] hands, and
stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all your
despite against the land of Israel; 7} Behold, therefore I
will stretch out mine hand upon you, and will deliver you
for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut you off from the
people, and I will cause you to perish out of the countries: I will destroy you; and you shalt know that I [am] Enki.
8} Thus saith Enki; Because that Moab and
Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah [is] like unto all the
heathen; 9} Therefore, behold, I will open the side of
Moab from the cities, from his cities [which are] on his
frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-
meon, and Kiriathaim, 10} Unto the men of the east
with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that
the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.
11} And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they
shall know that I [am] Enki.
12} Thus saith Enki; Because that Edom
hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance,
and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;
13} Therefore thus saith Enki; I will also
stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and
beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and
they of Dedan shall fall by the sword. 14} And I will
lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people
Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger
and according to my fury; and they shall know my
vengeance, saith Enki.
15} Thus saith Enki; Because the Philistines
have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a
despiteful heart, to destroy [it] for the old hatred; 16}
Therefore thus saith Enki; Behold, I will stretch
out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the
Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.
17} And I will execute great vengeance upon them with
furious rebukes; and they shall know that I [am] Enki,
when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.
{26:1} And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the
first [day] of the month, [that] the word of Enki came
unto me, saying, {26:2} Son of man, because that Tyrus
hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken [that was]
the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: I shall be
replenished, [now] she is laid waste: {26:3} Therefore thus
saith Enki; Behold, I [am] against you, O Tyrus,
and will cause many nations to come up against you, as the
sea causeth his waves to come up. {26:4} And they shall
destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I
will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top
of a rock. {26:5} It shall be [a place for] the spreading of
nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken [it,] saith the
Lord GOD: and it shall become a spoil to the nations.
{26:6} And her daughters which [are] in the field shall be
slain by the sword; and they shall know that I [am] the
LORD.
{26:7} For thus saith Enki; Behold, I will bring
upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of
kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and
with horsemen, and companies, and much people. {26:8}
He shall slay with the sword your daughters in the field: and
he shall make a fort against you, and cast a mount against
you, and lift up the buckler against you. {26:9} And he
shall set engines of war against your walls, and with his axes
he shall break down your towers. {26:10} By reason of the
abundance of his horses their dust shall cover you: your
walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the
wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into your
gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.
{26:11} With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all
your streets: he shall slay your people by the sword, and your
strong garrisons shall go down to the ground. {26:12} And

they shall make a spoil of your riches, and make a prey of your
merchandise: and they shall break down your walls, and
destroy your pleasant houses: and they shall lay your stones
and your timber and your dust in the midst of the water.
{26:13} And I will cause the noise of your songs to cease;
and the sound of your harps shall be no more heard. {26:14}
And I will make you like the top of a rock: you shalt be [a
place] to spread nets upon; you shalt be built no more: for I
Enki have spoken [it,] saith Enki.
{26:15} Thus saith Enki to Tyrus; Shall not the
isles shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded cry,
when the slaughter is made in the midst of you? {26:16}
Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their
thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their
broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with
trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble
at [every] moment, and be astonished at you. {26:17} And
they shall take up a lamentation for you, and say to you,
How art you destroyed, [that wast] inhabited of seafaring
men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she
and her inhabitants, which cause their terror [to be] on all
that haunt it! {26:18} Now shall the isles tremble in the day
of your fall; yea, the isles that [are] in the sea shall be
troubled at your departure. {26:19} For thus saith the Lord
GOD; When I shall make you a desolate city, like the cities
that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon
you, and great waters shall cover you; {26:20} When I
shall bring you down with them that descend into the pit,
with the people of old time, and shall set you in the low
parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that
go down to the pit, that you be not inhabited; and I shall set
glory in the land of the living; {26:21} I will make you a
terror, and you [shalt be] no [more:] though you be sought
for, yet shalt you never be found again, saith Enki.
