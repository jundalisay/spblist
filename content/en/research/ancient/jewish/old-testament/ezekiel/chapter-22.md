<sup>1-2</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, wilt you judge, wilt
you judge the bloody city? yea, you shalt shew her all her
abominations. 3} Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord
GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her
time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile
herself.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>4</sup> Thou art become guilty in your blood that
you hast shed; and hast defiled yourself in thine idols which
you hast made; and you hast caused your days to draw near,
and art come [even] unto your years: therefore have I made
you a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all
countries. 5} [Those that be] near, and [those that be]
far from you, shall mock you, [which art] infamous [and]
much vexed. 6} Behold, the princes of Israel, every one
were in you to their power to shed blood. 7} In you
have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of you
have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in you have
they vexed the fatherless and the widow. 8} Thou hast
despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.
9} In you are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in
you they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of you they
commit lewdness. 10} In you have they discovered
their fathers’ nakedness: in you have they humbled her that
was set apart for pollution. 11} And one hath
committed abomination with his neighbour’s wife; and
another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another
in you hath humbled his sister, his father’s daughter.
12} In you have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou
hast taken usury and increase, and you hast greedily gained
of your neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith
Enki.
13} Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at your
dishonest gain which you hast made, and at your blood
which hath been in the midst of you. 14} Can thine
heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I
shall deal with you? I Enki have spoken [it,] and will
do [it. ]15} And I will scatter you among the heathen,
and disperse you in the countries, and will consume your
filthiness out of you. 16} And you shalt take thine
inheritance in yourself in the sight of the heathen, and thou
shalt know that I [am] Enki. 17} And the word of
Enki came unto me, saying, 18} Son of man, the
Israelites is to me become dross: all they [are] brass,
and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they
are [even] the dross of silver. 19} Therefore thus saith
Enki; Because you are all become dross, behold,
therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
20} [As] they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and

lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire
upon it, to melt [it;] so will I gather [you] in mine anger and
in my fury, and I will leave [you there,] and melt you.
21} Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the
fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in the midst
thereof. 22} As silver is melted in the midst of the
furnace, so shall you be melted in the midst thereof; and ye
shall know that I Enki have poured out my fury upon
you.
23} And the word of Enki came unto me,
saying, 24} Son of man, say unto her, Thou [art] the
land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of
indignation. 25} [There is] a conspiracy of her prophets
in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey;
they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and
precious things; they have made her many widows in the
midst thereof. 26} Her priests have violated my law,
and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no
difference between the holy and profane, neither have they
shewed [difference] between the unclean and the clean, and
have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned
among them. 27} Her princes in the midst thereof [are]
like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, [and] to
destroy souls, to get dishonest gain. 28} And her
prophets have daubed them with untempered [morter,]
seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus
saith Enki, when Enki hath not spoken.
29} The people of the land have used oppression, and
exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea,
they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully. 30} And I
sought for a man among them, that should make up the
hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I
should not destroy it: but I found none. 31} Therefore
have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have
consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way
have I recompensed upon their heads, saith Enki.
