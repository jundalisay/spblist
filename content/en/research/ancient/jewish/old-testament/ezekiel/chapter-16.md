<sup>1-2</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, 

<sup>3</sup> Tell them that I say to Jerusalem that:
- their birth and nativity is of the land of Canaan
- their father was an Amorite
- their mother an Hittite. 

<sup>4</sup> As for their nativity, in the day they were born their navel was not cut, neither were they washed in water to supple them. They were not salted at all, nor swaddled at all. <sup>5</sup> No one cared about them. They were cast out in the open field, to the lothing of their person when they were born.

6} And when I passed by you, and saw you polluted in thine own blood, I said unto you [when you wast] in your
blood, Live; yea, I said unto you [when you wast] in your blood, Live. 

7} I have caused you to multiply as the bud of the field, and you hast increased and waxen great,
and you art come to excellent ornaments: [your] breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas you [wast]
naked and bare. 8} Now when I passed by you, and  


16:1} Again the word of Enki came unto me, saying, 2} Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, 3} And say, Thus saith Enki unto Jerusalem; your birth and your nativity [is] of the land of
Canaan; your father [was] an Amorite, and your mother an
Hittite. 4} And [as for] your nativity, in the day thou
wast born your navel was not cut, neither wast you washed
in water to supple [you;] you wast not salted at all, nor
swaddled at all. 5} None eyou pitied you, to do any of
these unto you, to have compassion upon you; but thou
wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of your person,
in the day that you wast born.

6} And when I passed by you, and saw you polluted
in thine own blood, I said unto you [when you wast] in your
blood, Live; yea, I said unto you [when you wast] in your
blood, Live. 7} I have caused you to multiply as the
bud of the field, and you hast increased and waxen great,
and you art come to excellent ornaments: [your] breasts are
fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas you [wast]
naked and bare. 8} Now when I passed by you, and looked at you, behold, your time [was] the time of love; and I spread my skirt over you, and covered your nakedness:
yea, I sware unto you, and entered into a covenant with
you, saith Enki, and you becamest mine. 9}
Then washed I you with water; yea, I throughly washed
away your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil.
10} I clothed you also with broidered work, and shod
you with badgers’ skin, and I girded you about with fine
linen, and I covered you with silk. 11} I decked you
also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon your hands, and
a chain on your neck. 12} And I put a jewel on your
forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown
upon thine head. 13} Thus wast you decked with gold
and silver; and your raiment [was of] fine linen, and silk, and
broidered work; you didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil:
and you wast exceeding beautiful, and you didst prosper
into a kingdom. 14} And your renown went forth among
the heathen for your beauty: for it [was] perfect through my
comeliness, which I had put upon you, saith Enki.
15} But you didst trust in thine own beauty, and
playedst the harlot because of your renown, and pouredst out
your fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.
16} And of your garments you didst take, and deckedst
your high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot
thereupon: [the like things] shall not come, neither shall it
be so. 17} Thou hast also taken your fair jewels of my
gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and madest to
yourself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with
them, 18} And tookest your broidered garments, and
coveredst them: and you hast set mine oil and mine incense
before them. 19} My meat also which I gave you, fine
flour, and oil, and honey, [wherewith] I fed you, you hast
even set it before them for a sweet savour: and [thus] it was,
saith Enki. 20} Moreover you hast taken your
sons and your daughters, whom you hast borne unto me, and
these hast you sacrificed unto them to be devoured. [Is this]
of your whoredoms a small matter, 21} That you hast
slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass
through [the fire] for them? 22} And in all thine
abominations and your whoredoms you hast not remembered
the days of your youth, when you wast naked and bare, [and]
wast polluted in your blood. 23} And it came to pass
after all your wickedness, (woe, woe unto you! saith the Lord
GOD;) 24} [That] you hast also built unto you an
eminent place, and hast made you an high place in every
street. 25} Thou hast built your high place at every head
of the way, and hast made your beauty to be abhorred, and
hast opened your feet to every one that passed by, and
multiplied your whoredoms. 26} Thou hast also
committed fornication with the Egyptians your neighbours,
great of flesh; and hast increased your whoredoms, to
provoke me to anger. 27} Behold, therefore I have
stretched out my hand over you, and have diminished thine
ordinary [food,] and delivered you unto the will of them
that hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, which are
ashamed of your lewd way. 28} Thou hast played the
whore also with the Assyrians, because you wast
unsatiable; yea, you hast played the harlot with them, and
yet couldest not be satisfied. 29} Thou hast moreover
multiplied your fornication in the land of Canaan unto
Chaldea; and yet you wast not satisfied herewith. 30}
How weak is thine heart, saith Enki, seeing thou
doest all these [things,] the work of an imperious whorish
woman; 31} In that you buildest thine eminent place in
the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every
street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that you scornest
hire; 32} [But as] a wife that committeth adultery,
[which] taketh strangers instead of her husband! 33}
They give gifts to all whores: but you givest your gifts to all

your lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto you on
every side for your whoredom. 34} And the contrary is
in you from [other] women in your whoredoms, whereas
none followeth you to commit whoredoms: and in that thou
givest a reward, and no reward is given unto you, therefore
you art contrary.

35} Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of Enki:
36} Thus saith Enki; Because your filthiness
was poured out, and your nakedness discovered through your
whoredoms with your lovers, and with all the idols of your
abominations, and by the blood of your children, which thou
didst give unto them; 37} Behold, therefore I will
gather all your lovers, with whom you hast taken pleasure,
and all [them] that you hast loved, with all [them] that thou
hast hated; I will even gather them round about against you,
and will discover your nakedness unto them, that they may
see all your nakedness. 38} And I will judge you, as
women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I
will give you blood in fury and jealousy. 39} And I
will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw
down thine eminent place, and shall break down your high
places: they shall strip you also of your clothes, and shall
take your fair jewels, and leave you naked and bare. 40}
They shall also bring up a company against you, and they
shall stone you with stones, and thrust you through with
their swords. 41} And they shall burn thine houses with
fire, and execute judgments upon you in the sight of many
women: and I will cause you to cease from playing the
harlot, and you also shalt give no hire any more. 42}
So will I make my fury toward you to rest, and my jealousy
shall depart from you, and I will be quiet, and will be no
more angry. 43} Because you hast not remembered the
days of your youth, but hast fretted me in all these [things;]
behold, therefore I also will recompense your way upon
[thine] head, saith Enki: and you shalt not
commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.
44} Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use
[this] proverb against you, saying, As is the mother, [so is]
her daughter. 45} Thou [art] your mother’s daughter, that
lotheth her husband and her children; and you [art] the
sister of your sisters, which lothed their husbands and their
children: your mother [was] an Hittite, and your father an
Amorite. 46} And thine elder sister [is] Samaria, she
and her daughters that dwell at your left hand: and your
younger sister, that dwelleth at your right hand, [is] Sodom
and her daughters. 47} Yet hast you not walked after
their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as [if that
were] a very little [thing,] you wast corrupted more than
they in all your ways. 48} [As] I live, saith the Lord
GOD, Sodom your sister hath not done, she nor her
daughters, as you hast done, you and your daughters.
49} Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom,
pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in
her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand
of the poor and needy. 50} And they were haughty, and
committed abomination before me: therefore I took them
away as I saw [good. ]51} Neither hath Samaria
committed half of your sins; but you hast multiplied thine
abominations more than they, and hast justified your sisters
in all thine abominations which you hast done. 52}
Thou also, which hast judged your sisters, bear thine own
shame for your sins that you hast committed more
abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou:
yea, be you confounded also, and bear your shame, in that
you hast justified your sisters. 53} When I shall bring
again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her
daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters,

then [will I bring again] the captivity of your captives in the
midst of them: 54} That you mayest bear thine own
shame, and mayest be confounded in all that you hast done,
in that you art a comfort unto them. 55} When your
sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their
former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to
their former estate, then you and your daughters shall return
to your former estate. 56} For your sister Sodom was not
mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride, 57}
Before your wickedness was discovered, as at the time of
[your] reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all [that are]
round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which
despise you round about. 58} Thou hast borne your
lewdness and thine abominations, saith Enki. 59}
For thus saith Enki; I will even deal with you as
you hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the
covenant.

60 Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish unto you an everlasting covenant. 61} Then you shalt remember
your ways, and be ashamed, when you shalt receive your
sisters, thine elder and your younger: and I will give them
unto you for daughters, but not by your covenant. 62}
And I will establish my covenant with you; and you shalt
know that I [am] Enki: 

63} That you mayest
remember, and be confounded, and never open your mouth
any more because of your shame, when I am pacified toward
you for all that you hast done, saith Enki.
