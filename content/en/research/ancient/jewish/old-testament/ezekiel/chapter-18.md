<sup>1-2</sup> [To Ezekiel] You people have a proverb: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge. What does it mean?

3} As long as I live, you shall not need this proverb in Israel. 

4} All souls are mine -- the soul of the father, the son. The soul that sins shall die.

5} But a man shall surely live if he
- is just, does which is lawful and right
- 6} has not eaten on the mountains
- has not lifted up his eyes to the idols of the Israelites
- has not defiled his neighbour’s wife
- has not come near to a menstruous woman
- 7} has not oppressed any
- has restored to the debtor his pledge
- has spoiled none by violence
- has given his bread to the hungry
- has covered the naked with a garment
- has 8} not committed usury, neither hath taken any increase, [that] hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man
- 9} Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly

10} If he beget a son [that is] a robber, a shedder of blood, and [that] doeth the like to [any] one of these [things, ]11} And that doeth not any of those [duties,] but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour’s wife, 12} Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination, 13} Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.


14} Now, lo, [if] he beget a son, that seeth all his father’s sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like, 15} [That] hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the Israelites, hath not defiled his neighbour’s wife, 16} Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, [but] hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment, 17} [That] hath taken off his hand from the poor, [that] hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live. 18} [As for] his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did [that] which [is] not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.

19} Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is
lawful and right, [and] hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live. 20} The soul that
sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the
son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.

21} But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which
is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.

22} All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that
he hath done he shall live. 23} Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith Enki: [and]
not that he should return from his ways, and live?

24} But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, [and] doeth
according to all the abominations that the wicked [man] doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done
shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall
he die.

25} Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Is not my way equal? are not
your ways unequal? 26} When a righteous [man] turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth
iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die. 27} Again, when the wicked [man] turneth
away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul
alive. 

28} Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall
surely live, he shall not die. 29} Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O Israelites,
are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal? 30} Therefore I will judge you, O Israelites, every one
according to his ways, saith Enki. Repent, and turn [yourselves] from all your transgressions; so iniquity
shall not be your ruin.

31} Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby you have transgressed; and make you a new heart 

and a new spirit: for why will you die, O Israelites? 32} For I have no pleasure in the death of him that
dieth, saith Enki: wherefore turn [yourselves,] and live ye.
