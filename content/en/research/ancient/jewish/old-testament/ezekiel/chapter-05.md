<sup>1</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, take you a sharp knife, take you a barberâ€™s razor, and cause [it] to pass upon thine head and upon your beard: then take you balances to weigh, and divide the [hair.]

<sup>2</sup> Burn 1/3 in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and you shalt take a third part, [and] smite about it with a knife: and a third part you shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them. 

3 Take thereof a few in number, and bind them in your skirts. 

4 Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; [for] thereof shall a fire come forth into all the Israelites.

5 This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries [that are] round about her. 

6 She hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that [are] round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them. 

7 Because you multiplied more than the nations that [are] round about you, [and] have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that [are] round about you
{{< /l >}}


8 Behold, I, even I, [am] against you, and will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations. 

9 I will do in you that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations. 

10 Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in you, and the whole remnant of you will I scatter into all the winds. 

11 Wherefore, [as] I live, saith Enki; Surely, because you hast defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish [you;] neither shall mine eyou spare, neither will I have any pity.

12 A third part of you shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of you: 

A third part shall fall by the sword round about you and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them. 5:13} Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I Enki have spoken [it] in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them. 

14 Moreover I will make you waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about you, in the sight of all that pass by. 

15 So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that [are] round about you, when I shall execute judgments in you in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I Enki have spoken [it.

16 When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for [their] destruction, [and] which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine on you, and will break your staff of bread: 

17 So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave you; and pestilence and blood shall pass through you and I will bring the sword upon you. I Enki have spoken it.
