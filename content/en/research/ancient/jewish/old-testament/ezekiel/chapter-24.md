<sup>1</sup> In the year 9, month 10, day 10, I heard Enki saying to me:


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>2</sup> Son of man, write you the name of the day, [even] of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.

3 Utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith Enki; Set on a pot, set [it] on, and also pour water into it: 4 Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill [it] with
the choice bones. 5} Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, [and] make it boil well, and let
them seethe the bones of it therein.

6} Wherefore thus saith Enki; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum [is] not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall up on it. 7} For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon
the ground, to cover it with dust; 

8} That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood
upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered. 9 Therefore thus saith Enki; Woe to the bloody city!
I will even make the pile for fire great.

10} Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned. 11} Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and [that] the filthiness of it may be molten in it, [that] the scum of it may be consumed. 12} She hath wearied
[herself] with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of
her: her scum [shall be] in the fire. 13} In your filthiness
[is] lewdness: because I have purged you, and you wast not
purged, you shalt not be purged from your filthiness any
more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon you. 14} I
Enki have spoken [it:] it shall come to pass, and I will
do [it;] I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I
repent; according to your ways, and according to your doings,
shall they judge you, saith Enki.
15} Also the word of Enki came unto me,
saying, 16} Son of man, behold, I take away from you
the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou
mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down. 17}
Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire
of thine head upon you, and put on your shoes upon your feet,
and cover not [your] lips, and eat not the bread of men.
18} So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at
even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was
commanded.

{{< r a="Israelites" >}}
19 [To Ezekiel] Tell us what these things are to us that you do? 
{{< /r >}}

20 The word of Enki came to me, saying:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
21 Tell them that I said: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and
that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left shall fall by the sword.
22} And you shall do as I have done: you shall not cover [your] lips, nor eat the bread of men. 23} And your tires
[shall be] upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: you shall not mourn nor weep; but you shall pine away for
your iniquities, and mourn one toward another. 
{{< /l >}}


24 Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall you do: and when this cometh, you shall know that I
[am] Enki. 25} Also, you son of man, [shall it] not [be] in the day when I take from them their strength,
the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that
whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their
daughters, 26} [That] he that escapeth in that day shall
come unto you, to cause [you] to hear [it] with [thine] ears?
27} In that day shall your mouth be opened to him which
is escaped, and you shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and
you shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I
[am] Enki.
