<sup>1</sup> In year 30, month 4, day 5, I was among the captives by the river of Chebar.

The heavens were opened, and I saw visions of the Anunnaki. 

<sup>2</sup> In day 5 of the month, which was year 5 of king Jehoiachin’s captivity, 

<sup>3</sup> The word of Enki came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar.

The hand of Enki was there upon him. 

<sup>4</sup> I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north.

A great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was around it.

Out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire. 

<sup>5</sup> Out of it came the likeness of 4 living creatures.

They looked like men. 

<sup>6</sup> Each one had 4 faces and 4 wings.

<sup>7</sup> Their feet were straight. The sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot.

They sparkled like the colour of burnished brass. 

<sup>8</sup> They had the hands of a man under their wings on their 4 sides.

They four had their faces and their wings. 

<sup>9</sup> Their wings were joined one to another. They did not turn towards where they went. Every wing went straight forward.

<sup>10</sup> They had 4 faces. On the right side was the face of a man and a lion

The left side had that of an ox and an eagle. 

<!--  on the left side; they four
also had the face of an eagle.  -->

<sup>11</sup> Their wings were stretched upward. The 2 wings were joined one to another. The other 2 covered their bodies. 

<sup>12</sup> Their wings went straight forward to where their spirit was to go. Their wings turned not when they went. 

<sup>13</sup> Their appearance was like burning coals of fire and  the appearance of lamps.

It went up and down among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.

<sup>14</sup> The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.


### Their Spacecraft

<sup>15</sup> As I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces. 

<sup>16</sup> The appearance of the wheels and their work [was] like unto the colour of a beryl. They four had one likeness. 

Their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. 

<sup>17</sup> When they went, they went on their 4 sides. They turned not when they went. 

<sup>18</sup> As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful. Their rings were full of eyes round about them four.

<sup>19</sup> When the living creatures went, the wheels went by them. When they were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. 

<sup>20</sup> Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither [was their] spirit to go. 

The wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature [was] in the wheels. 

<sup>21</sup> When those went, [these] went; and when those stood, [these] stood.

When those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature [was] in the wheels. 

<sup>22</sup> The likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature [was] as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above. 

<sup>23</sup> Under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.

<sup>24</sup> When they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host.

When they stood, they let down their wings. 

<sup>25</sup> There was a voice from the firmament that [was] over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.

<sup>26</sup> Above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone. 

On the likeness of the throne [was] the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. 

<sup>27</sup> I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. 

<sup>28</sup> As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so [was] the appearance of the brightness round about. 

This was the appearance of the Anunnaki. 

 <!-- likeness of the glory of Enki. And -->

When I saw them I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.
