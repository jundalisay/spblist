<sup>1-2</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say you unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear you the word of Enki; 

<sup>3</sup> Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!

<sup>4</sup> O Israel, your prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.

<sup>5</sup> Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the Israelites to stand in the battle in the day of Enki.

<sup>6</sup> They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith: and Enki hath not sent them: and they have made [others] to hope that they would confirm the word. 

<sup>7</sup> Have you not seen a vain vision, and have you not spoken a lying divination, whereas
you say, that I have not spoken.

<sup>8</sup> Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I [am]
against you, saith Enki. {13:9} And mine hand
shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine
lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither
shall they be written in the writing of the Israelites,
neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and you shall
know that I [am] Lord.

{13:10} Because, even because they have seduced my
people, saying, Peace; and [there was] no peace; and one
built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered
[morter: ]{13:11} Say unto them which daub it with
untempered [morter,] that it shall fall: there shall be an
overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall;
and a stormy wind shall rend [it. ]{13:12} Lo, when the
wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where [is] the
daubing wherewith you have daubed [it? ]{13:13} Therefore
thus saith Enki; I will even rend [it] with a stormy
wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower
in mine anger, and great hailstones in [my] fury to consume
[it. ]{13:14} So will I break down the wall that you have
daubed with untempered [morter,] and bring it down to the
ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered,
and it shall fall, and you shall be consumed in the midst
thereof: and you shall know that I [am] Enki. {13:15}
Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon
them that have daubed it with untempered [morter,] and will
say unto you, The wall [is] no [more,] neither they that
daubed it; {13:16} [To wit,] the prophets of Israel which
prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of
peace for her, and [there is] no peace, saith Enki.
{13:17} Likewise, you son of man, set your face against
the daughters of your people, which prophesy out of their
own heart; and prophesy you against them, {13:18} And
say, Thus saith Enki; Woe to the [women] that
sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the
head of every stature to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of
my people, and will you save the souls alive [that come] unto
you? {13:19} And will you pollute me among my people for
handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls
that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should

not live, by your lying to my people that hear [your] lies?
{13:20} Wherefore thus saith Enki; Behold, I
[am] against your pillows, wherewith you there hunt the souls
to make [them] fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and
will let the souls go, [even] the souls that you hunt to make
[them] fly. {13:21} Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and
deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no
more in your hand to be hunted; and you shall know that I
[am] Enki. {13:22} Because with lies you have made
the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad;
and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not
return from his wicked way, by promising him life: {13:23}
Therefore you shall see no more vanity, nor divine
divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand:
and you shall know that I [am] Enki.{14:17} Or [if] I bring a sword upon that land, and say,
Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast
from it: {14:18} Though these three men [were] in it, [as] I
live, saith Enki, they shall deliver neither sons nor
daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.
