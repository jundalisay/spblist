<sup>1</sup> The spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of Enkiâ€™s house, which looketh eastward.

At the door of the gate were 25 men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, the princes of the people.

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>2</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, these are the men who devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this  city: {11:3} Which say, [It is] not near; let us build houses: this [city is] the caldron, and we [be] the flesh. {11:4} Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son
of man.

<sup>5</sup> The Spirit of Enki fell upon me saying:

Thus saith Enki; Thus have you said, O Israelites: for I know the things that come
into your mind, [every one of] them. {11:6} Ye have
multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled the
streets thereof with the slain. {11:7} Therefore thus saith
Enki; Your slain whom you have laid in the midst
of it, they [are] the flesh, and this [city is] the caldron: but I
will bring you forth out of the midst of it. {11:8} Ye have
feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith
Enki. {11:9} And I will bring you out of the midst
thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will
execute judgments among you. 

{11:10} Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and you shall
know that I [am] Enki. {11:11} This [city] shall not be
your caldron, neither shall you be the flesh in the midst
thereof; [but] I will judge you in the border of Israel:
{11:12} And you shall know that I [am] Enki: for ye
have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my
judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen
that [are] round about you.

{11:13} While I was prophesying, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. 

Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD!
wilt you make a full end of the remnant of Israel? {11:14}
Again the word of Enki came unto me, saying,
{11:15} Son of man, your brethren, [even] your brethren, the
men of your kindred, and all the Israelites wholly, [are]
they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get
you far from Enki: unto us is this land given in
possession. {11:16} Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord
GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen,
and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet
will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where
they shall come. {11:17} Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord
GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble
you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I
will give you the land of Israel. 

{11:18} And they shall
come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable
things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.
{11:19} And I will give them one heart, and I will put a
new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of
their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh: {11:20}
That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine
ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I
will be their God. {11:21} But [as for them] whose heart
walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their
abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own
heads, saith Enki.

{11:22} Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and
the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel
[was] over them above. {11:23} And the glory of Enki
went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the
mountain which [is] on the east side of the city.
{11:24} Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me
in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the
captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.
{11:25} Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the
things that Enki had shewed me.
