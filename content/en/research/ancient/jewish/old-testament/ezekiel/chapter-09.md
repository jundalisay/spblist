<sup>13</sup> [To Ezekiel] Turn you yet again, [and] you shalt see greater abominations that they do.

<sup>14</sup> Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Enki’S house which was towards the north. Behold, there sat
women weeping for Tammuz.


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>15</sup> [To Ezekiel] Have you seen this, O son of man? There are greater abominations than these.
{{< /l >}}


16 He brought me into the inner court of his house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of Enki, between the porch and the altar, were about 25 men, with their backs toward the temple of Enki, and their faces toward the east. They worshipped the sun toward the east.


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>15</sup> [To Ezekiel] Have you seen [this,] O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose. 

8:18} Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye
shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry
in mine ears with a loud voice, [yet] will I not hear them.

9:1} He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying,
Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near,
even every man [with] his destroying weapon in his hand.

9:2} And, behold, six men came from the way of the
higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a
slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them
[was] clothed with linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side:
and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar. 

9:3} The glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the
cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house.
And he called to the man clothed with linen, which [had]
the writer’s inkhorn by his side; 9:4} And Enki said
unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the
midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of
the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that
be done in the midst thereof.

9:5} And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye
after him through the city, and smite: let not your eyou spare,
neither have you pity: 9:6} Slay utterly old [and] young,
both maids, and little children, and women: but come not
near any man upon whom [is] the mark; and begin at my
sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which [were]
before the house. 9:7} And he said unto them, Defile the
house, and fill the courts with the slain: go you forth. And
they went forth, and slew in the city.

9:8} And it came to pass, while they were slaying them,
and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said,
Ah Lord GOD! wilt you destroy all the residue of Israel in
your pouring out of your fury upon Jerusalem? 

9:9} Then
said he unto me, The iniquity of the Israelites and
Judah [is] exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and
the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath
forsaken the earth, and Enki seeth not. 9:10} And as
for me also, mine eyou shall not spare, neither will I have
pity, [but] I will recompense their way upon their head. 

9:11} And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which [had] the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as you hast commanded me.
