<sup>1-2</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, go to Jerusalem and drop your word towards the holy places. Prophesy against the land of Israel, 3} Say to the land of Israel:

'Enki says: I [am] against you, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked. 4} Seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north'
{{< /l >}}


<sup>5</sup> All flesh may know that I Enki have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more. 6} Sigh therefore, you son of man, with the breaking of [your] loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes. 

7} When they say unto you, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh.

Every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak [as] water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass.

<sup>8-9</sup> Son of man, prophesy, and say that Enki said that a sword is sharpened and furbished: 10} It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, [as] every tree.

11} He hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer. 12} Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it [shall be] upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon [your] thigh. 

13 Because [it is] a trial, and what if [the sword] contemn even the rod? 

it shall be no [more,] saith Enki. 14} Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite [thine] hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it [is] the sword of the great [men that are] slain, which entereth into their privy chambers. 

15} I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that [their] heart may faint, and [their] ruins be multiplied: ah! [it is] made bright, [it is] wrapped up for the slaughter. 16} Go you one way or other, [either] on the right hand, [or] on the left, whithersoever your face [is] set.

17} I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I Enki have said [it. ]

<sup>18-19</sup> Also, you son of man, appoint you two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain
shall come forth out of one land: and choose you a place, choose [it] at the head of the way to the city. 

20 Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced. 21} For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made [his] arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver. 

22} At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint [battering] rams against the gates, to cast a mount, [and] to build a fort. 

23} And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken. 

24} Therefore thus saith Enki; Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, [I say,] that you are come to remembrance, you shall be taken with the hand.

25 You, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity [shall have] an end, 26} Thus saith Enki; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this [shall] not [be] the same: exalt [him that is] low, and abase [him that is] high. 27} I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no [more,] until he come whose right it is; and I will give it [him. ]

28} You, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith Enki concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword [is] drawn: for the slaughter [it is] furbished, to consume because of the glittering: 

29} Whiles they see vanity unto you, whiles they divine a lie unto you, to bring you upon the necks of [them that are] slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity [shall have] an end. 

30} Shall I cause [it] to return into his sheath? I will judge you in the place where you wast created, in the land of your nativity. 

31} I will pour out mine indignation upon you, I will blow against you in the fire of my wrath, and deliver you into the hand of brutish men, [and] skilful to destroy.

32} You shalt be for fuel to the fire; your blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no [more] remembered: for I Enki have spoken [it.]
