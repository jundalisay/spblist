1 Then came certain of the elders of Israel to me and sat before me. 2 I heard Enki saying:

3 Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face. 

Should I be enquired of at all by them? 

4 Every man of the Israelites that sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet, I Enki will answer him that comes according to the multitude of his idols


5 I may take the Israelites in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols. 22} Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, [both] sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and you shall see their way and their doings: and you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, [even] concerning all that I have brought upon it. 

23 They shall comfort you, when you see their ways and their doings: and
you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I
have done in it, saith Enki.

6} Therefore say unto the Israelites, Thus saith Enki; Repent, and turn [yourselves] from your
idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.

7} For every one of the Israelites, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself
from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the
stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh
to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I Enki
will answer him by myself: 8} And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb,
and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye
shall know that I [am] Enki. 9} And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I Enki have
deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon
him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people
Israel. 10} And they shall bear the punishment of their
iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the
punishment of him that seeketh [unto him; ]11} That
the Israelites may go no more astray from me, neither
be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that
they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the
Lord GOD.

12} The word of Enki came again to me, saying, 13} Son of man, when the land sinneth against
me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine
hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof,
and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast
from it: 14} Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and
Job, were in it, they should deliver [but] their own souls by
their righteousness, saith Enki.

15} If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the
land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man
may pass through because of the beasts: 16} [Though]
these three men [were] in it, [as] I live, saith Enki,
they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall
be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.

17} Or [if] I bring a sword upon that land, and say,
Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast
from it: 18} Though these three men [were] in it, [as] I
live, saith Enki, they shall deliver neither sons nor
daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.

19 Or [if] I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and
beast: 20} Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, [were] in it, [as] I live, saith Enki, they shall deliver neither
son nor daughter; they shall [but] deliver their own souls by
their righteousness. 

21} For thus saith Enki; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?

22} Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that
shall be brought forth, [both] sons and daughters: behold,
they shall come forth unto you, and you shall see their way
and their doings: and you shall be comforted concerning the
evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, [even] concerning
all that I have brought upon it. 

23 They shall comfort you, when you see their ways and their doings: and
you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I
have done in it, saith Enki.
