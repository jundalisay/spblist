<sup>1</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, take a tile, and lay it before you. Pourtray upon it the city, [even] Jerusalem: 2} And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set [battering] rams against it round about. 3} Moreover take you unto you an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city: and set your face against it, and it shall be besieged, and you shalt lay siege against it. This
[shall be] a sign to the Israelites. 

<sup>4</sup> Lie on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the Israelites on it: [according] to the number of the days that thou shall lie upon it you shalt bear their iniquity. 5} For I have laid upon you the years of their iniquity, according to
the number of the days, 390 days: so shalt you bear the iniquity of the Israelites.

<sup>6</sup> When you have accomplished them, lie again on your right side. You shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah 40 days. I have appointed you each day for a year.

<sup>7</sup> So set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem. Your arm shall be uncovered. You shall prophesy against it. 8 I will lay bands on you, and you shalt not turn you from one side to another, till you have ended the days of your siege.

9 Take with you wheat, barley, beans, lentiles, millet, and fitches. Put them in 1 vessel and make bread from it according to the number of the days that you shall lie on your side. Eat it for 390 days. 10 Your meat which you shalt eat shall be by weight, 20 shekels a day: from time to time shall you eat it. 

11 You shall drink also water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time shall you drink. 12} You shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight. 

13 Even thus shall the Israelites eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.

14 Ah Lord! My soul has not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.

15 Lo, I have given you cow’s dung for man’s dung. You shall prepare your bread with it.

16 I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: They shall eat bread by weight, and with care. They shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment. 17 So that they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.
