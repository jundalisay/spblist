<sup>1</sup> In year 12, month 12, day 1, the word of Enki came to me, saying:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>2</sup> Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and you [art] as a whale in the seas: and you camest forth with your rivers, and troubledst the waters with your feet, and fouledst their rivers. 3} Thus saith Enki; I will therefore spread out my net over you with a company of many people; and they shall bring you up in my net. 

4} Then will I leave you upon the land, I will cast you forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon you, and I will fill the beasts of the
whole earth with you. 

5} And I will lay your flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with your height. 6} I
will also water with your blood the land wherein you swimmest, [even] to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of you. 
{{< /l >}}

7} And when I shall put you out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will
cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her
light. 8} All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark
over you, and set darkness upon your land, saith the Lord
GOD. 9} I will also vex the hearts of many people,
when I shall bring your destruction among the nations, into
the countries which you hast not known. 10} Yea, I
will make many people amazed at you, and their kings shall
be horribly afraid for you, when I shall brandish my sword
before them; and they shall tremble at [every] moment,
every man for his own life, in the day of your fall.
11} For thus saith Enki; The sword of the
king of Babylon shall come upon you. 

12} By the swords of the mighty will I cause your multitude to fall, the
terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the
pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be
destroyed. 13} I will destroy also all the beasts thereof
from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man
trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.
14} Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their
rivers to run like oil, saith Enki. 

15} When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall
be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite
all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I [am]
Enki. 16} This [is] the lamentation wherewith
they shall lament her: the daughters of the nations shall
lament her: they shall lament for her, [even] for Egypt, and
for all her multitude, saith Enki.

17 In year 12, month 15, the word of Enki came unto me, saying:

18 Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, [even] her, and the
daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the
earth, with them that go down into the pit. 19} Whom
dost you pass in beauty? go down, and be you laid with the
uncircumcised. 20} They shall fall in the midst of
[them that are] slain by the sword: she is delivered to the
sword: draw her and all her multitudes. 21} The strong
among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell
with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie
uncircumcised, slain by the sword. 22} Asshur [is]
there and all her company: his graves [are] about him: all of
them slain, fallen by the sword: 23} Whose graves are
set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about

her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which
caused terror in the land of the living. 24} There [is]
Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of
them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down
uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which
caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they
borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.
25} They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain
with all her multitude: her graves [are] round about him: all
of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their
terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they
borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is
put in the midst of [them that be] slain. 26} There [is]
Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves [are]
round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the
sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the
living. 27} And they shall not lie with the mighty [that
are] fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to
hell with their weapons of war: and they have laid their
swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon
their bones, though [they were] the terror of the mighty in
the land of the living. 28} Yea, you shalt be broken in
the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with [them that
are] slain with the sword. 29} There [is] Edom, her
kings, and all her princes, which with their might are laid by
[them that were] slain by the sword: they shall lie with the
uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.
30} There [be] the princes of the north, all of them, and
all the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with
their terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie
uncircumcised with [them that be] slain by the sword, and
bear their shame with them that go down to the pit. 31}
Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his
multitude, [even] Pharaoh and all his army slain by the
sword, saith Enki. 32} For I have caused my
terror in the land of the living: and he shall be laid in the
midst of the uncircumcised with [them that are] slain with
the sword, [even] Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the
Lord GOD.
