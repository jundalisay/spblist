<sup>1-2</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, take up a lamentation
for Tyrus; 3} And say unto Tyrus, O you that art
situate at the entry of the sea, [which art] a merchant of the
people for many isles, Thus saith Enki; O Tyrus,
you hast said, I [am] of perfect beauty. 4} your borders
[are] in the midst of the seas, your builders have perfected your
beauty. 5} They have made all your [ship] boards of fir
trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to
make masts for you. 6} [Of] the oaks of Bashan have
they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have
made your benches [of] ivory, [brought] out of the isles of
Chittim. 7} Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt
was that which you spreadest forth to be your sail; blue and
purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered
you.

8} The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were your
mariners: your wise [men,] O Tyrus, [that] were in you, were
your pilots. 9} The ancients of Gebal and the wise [men]
thereof were in you your calkers: all the ships of the sea with
their mariners were in you to occupy your merchandise.
10} They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in
thine army, your men of war: they hanged the shield and
helmet in you; they set forth your comeliness. 11} The
men of Arvad with thine army [were] upon your walls round
about, and the Gammadims were in your towers: they hanged
their shields upon your walls round about; they have made
your beauty perfect. 12} Tarshish [was] your merchant by
reason of the multitude of all [kind of] riches; with silver,
iron, tin, and lead, they traded in your fairs. 13} Javan,
Tubal, and Meshech, they [were] your merchants: they traded
the persons of men and vessels of brass in your market.
14} They of the house of Togarmah traded in your fairs
with horses and horsemen and mules. 15} The men of Dedan [were] your merchants; many isles [were] the
merchandise of thine hand: they brought you [for] a present
horns of ivory and ebony. 16} Syria [was] your merchant
by reason of the multitude of the wares of your making: they
occupied in your fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered
work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate. 17} Judah,
and the land of Israel, they [were] your merchants: they
traded in your market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and
honey, and oil, and balm. 18} Damascus [was] your
merchant in the multitude of the wares of your making, for
the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white
wool. 19} Dan also and Javan going to and fro
occupied in your fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were
in your market. 20} Dedan [was] your merchant in
precious clothes for chariots. 21} Arabia, and all the
princes of Kedar, they occupied with you in lambs, and
rams, and goats: in these [were they] your merchants.
22} The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they [were]
your merchants: they occupied in your fairs with chief of all
spices, and with all precious stones, and gold. 23}
Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba,
Asshur, [and] Chilmad, [were] your merchants. 24}
These [were] your merchants in all sorts [of things,] in blue
clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel,
bound with cords, and made of cedar, among your
merchandise. 25} The ships of Tarshish did sing of you
in your market: and you wast replenished, and made very
glorious in the midst of the seas. 26} your rowers have
brought you into great waters: the east wind hath broken
you in the midst of the seas. 27} your riches, and your
fairs, your merchandise, your mariners, and your pilots, your
calkers, and the occupiers of your merchandise, and all your
men of war, that [are] in you, and in all your company which
[is] in the midst of you, shall fall into the midst of the seas
in the day of your ruin. 28} The suburbs shall shake at
the sound of the cry of your pilots. 29} And all that
handle the oar, the mariners, [and] all the pilots of the sea,
shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the
land; 30} And shall cause their voice to be heard
against you, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust
upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:
31} And they shall make themselves utterly bald for
you, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for
you with bitterness of heart [and] bitter wailing. 32}
And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for
you, and lament over you, [saying,] What [city is] like
Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea? 33}
When your wares went forth out of the seas, you filledst
many people; you didst enrich the kings of the earth with
the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise. 34}
In the time [when] you shalt be broken by the seas in the
depths of the waters your merchandise and all your company
in the midst of you shall fall. 35} All the inhabitants of
the isles shall be astonished at you, and their kings shall be
sore afraid, they shall be troubled in [their] countenance.
36} The merchants among the people shall hiss at you;
you [shalt be] a terror, and never shalt be any more.
