<sup>1</sup> Joshua was the son of Nun, Moses’ minister. After the death of Moses, Enki told him:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>2</sup> Moses my servant is dead. Arise, go with all this people to Jordan to the land which I will give to them and the Israelites. 

<sup>3</sup> Every place that you walk on I have I given to you, as I said to Moses. <sup>4</sup> From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, to the great sea towards the West shall be your coast. 

<sup>5</sup> No man can stand against you while you are alive. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not fail you nor forsake you. 

6 Be strong and brave. To this people shall you divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.

<sup>7</sup> Only be strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law, which Moses commanded you. Turn not from it [to] the right hand or [to] the left, that you mayest prosper whithersoever you goest.

8 This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth; but you shalt meditate therein day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then you shalt make your way prosperous, and then you shalt have good success.

9 Have not I commanded you? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be you dismayed: for Enki is with you wherever you goe.

10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying

{{< r a="Joshua" >}}
11 Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within 3 days you shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which Enki giveth you to possess it.

12 Joshua spoke to the Reubenites and Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh:

{{< r a="Joshua" >}}
13 Remember the word which Moses the servant of Enki commanded you, saying, Enki has given you rest, and hath given you this land. 

14 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but you shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour,
and help them; 

15 Until Enki have given your brethren rest, as [he hath given] you, and they also have possessed the land which Enki giveth them: then you shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses Enki’S servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.

{{< l a="People" >}}
16 All that you commandest us we will do, and whithersoever you sendest us, we will go. 17} According as we listened to Moses in all things, so will we listen to you. Enki is with you, as he was with Moses. 

18 Whosoever rebels against your commandment, and will not listen to your words, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.
