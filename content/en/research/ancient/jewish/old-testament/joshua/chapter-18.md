<sup>1</sup>  The whole congregation of Israelites assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. 

The land was subdued before them. 

2 There remained among the Israelites 7 tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.

3 Joshua said to the Israelites, How long [are] you slack to go to possess the land, which Enki God of your fathers hath given you?

4 Give out from among you three men for [each] tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come [again] to me.

5 They shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north. 

6 Ye shall therefore describe the land [into] seven parts, and bring [the description] hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before Enki our God.

7} But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of Enki is their
inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of
Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on
the east, which Moses the servant of Enki gave them.

8 The men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and
walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to
me, that I may here cast lots for you before Enki in
Shiloh. 

9 The men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book,
and came [again] to Joshua to the host at Shiloh.

<sup>10</sup> Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Enki: and there Joshua divided the land unto the Israelites according to their divisions.

<sup>11</sup> The lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the
children of Joseph.

<sup>12</sup> Their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of
Jericho on the north side, and went up through the
mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the
wilderness of Beth-aven. 

{18:13} The border went over
from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel,
southward; and the border descended to Ataroth-adar, near
the hill that [lieth] on the south side of the nether Beth-
horon. {18:14} And the border was drawn [thence,] and
compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill
that [lieth] before Beth- horon southward; and the goings
out thereof were at Kirjath-baal, which [is] Kirjath- jearim,
a city of the children of Judah: this [was] the west quarter.

{18:15} And the south quarter [was] from the end of
Kirjath-jearim, and the border went out on the west, and
went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah: {18:16} And
the border came down to the end of the mountain that [lieth]
before the valley of the son of Hinnom, [and] which [is] in
the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the
valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and
descended to En-rogel, {18:17} And was drawn from the
north, and went forth to En-shemesh, and went forth toward
Geliloth, which [is] over against the going up of Adummim,
and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,
{18:18} And passed along toward the side over against
Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah: 

{18:19}
And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah
northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north
bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this [was] the
south coast. {18:20} And Jordan was the border of it on the
east side.

This [was] the inheritance of the children of
Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, according to
their families. {18:21} Now the cities of the tribe of the
children of Benjamin according to their families were
Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and the valley of Keziz, {18:22}
And Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel, {18:23} And
Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah, {18:24} And Chephar-
haammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their
villages: {18:25} Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth, {18:26}
And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah, {18:27} And
Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah, {18:28} And Zelah, Eleph,
and Jebusi, which [is] Jerusalem, Gibeath, [and] Kirjath;
fourteen cities with their villages. This [is] the inheritance
of the children of Benjamin according to their families.
