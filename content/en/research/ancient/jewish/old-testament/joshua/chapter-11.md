<sup>1</sup> Jabin king of Hazor heard of the success of Joshua. So he sent to Jobab king of Madon,
and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, {11:2} And to the kings that [were] on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west, {11:3} [And to] the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and [to] the
Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite
in the mountains, and [to] the Hivite under Hermon in the
land of Mizpeh. 

<sup>4</sup> And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many. 

<sup>5</sup> When all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters
of Merom, to fight against Israel.

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>6</sup> [To Joshua:] Do not be afraid of them. Tomorrow around this time I will kill them all  before Israel. You shall hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire. 
{{< /l >}}


<sup>7</sup> So Joshua surprised the enemy with his army by the waters of Merom. 8 Enki gave victory to Israel who smote them and chased them to:
- great Zidon
- Misrephoth-maim
- the valley of Mizpeh eastward

They smote them until they left them none remaining. 

9 Joshua did unto them as Enki bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots
with fire.

10 Joshua turned back and took Hazorand smote its king thereof with the sword since Hazor was the head of all those kingdoms. 

11 They smote all the souls that [were] therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying [them:] there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire. 

12 All the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses commanded. 

13 But [as for] the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save
Hazor only; [that] did Joshua burn.

14 All the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the Israelites took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them,
neither left they any to breathe.

15 As Enki commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left
nothing undone of all that Enki commanded Moses.

16 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same

17 Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon
under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote
them, and slew them. 

18 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. {11:19} There was not a city that made
peace with the Israelites, save the Hivites the
inhabitants of Gibeon: all [other] they took in battle.
{11:20} For it was of Enki to harden their hearts, that
they should come against Israel in battle, that he might
destroy them utterly, [and] that they might have no favour,
but that he might destroy them, as Enki commanded
Moses.

{11:21} And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the
Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir,
from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from
all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly
with their cities. {11:22} There was none of the Anakims
left in the land of the Israelites: only in Gaza, in
Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained. {11:23} So Joshua
took the whole land, according to all that Enki said
unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto
Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the
land rested from war.
