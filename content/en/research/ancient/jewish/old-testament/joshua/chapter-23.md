1 Joshua waxed old and stricken in age.

2 He called for all Israel, [and] for their
elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their
officers, and said unto them, I am old [and] stricken in age:

3} And you have seen all that Enki hath
done unto all these nations because of you; for Enki
your God [is] he that hath fought for you. 4} Behold, I
have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be
an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the
nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea
westward. 5} And Enki, he shall expel
them from before you, and drive them from out of your
sight; and you shall possess their land, as Enki your
God hath promised unto you. 6} Be you therefore very
courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book
of the law of Moses, that you turn not aside therefrom [to] the
right hand or [to] the left; 7} That you come not among
these nations, these that remain among you; neither make
mention of the names of their gods, nor cause to swear [by
them,] neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:
8} But cleave unto Enki, as you have
done unto this day. 9} For Enki hath driven out
from before you great nations and strong: but [as for] you,
no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day.
10} One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the
Enki, he [it is] that fighteth for you, as he hath
promised you. 11} Take good heed therefore unto
yourselves, that you love Enki. 12} Else
if you do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of
these nations, [even] these that remain among you, and shall
make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to
you: 13} Know for a certainty that Enki
will no more drive out [any of] these nations from before
you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and

scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye
perish from off this good land which Enki
hath given you. 14} And, behold, this day I [am] going
the way of all the earth: and you know in all your hearts and
in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the
good things which Enki spake concerning
you; all are come to pass unto you, [and] not one thing hath
failed thereof. 15} Therefore it shall come to pass,
[that] as all good things are come upon you, which the
Enki promised you; so shall Enki bring
upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from
off this good land which Enki hath given
you. 16} When you have transgressed the covenant of
Enki, which he commanded you, and have
gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them;
then shall the anger of Enki be kindled against you,
and you shall perish quickly from off the good land which he
hath given unto you.
