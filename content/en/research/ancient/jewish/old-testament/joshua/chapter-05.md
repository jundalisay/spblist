<sup>1</sup> When all the kings of the Amorites, which [were] on the side of Jordan westward, and
all the kings of the Canaanites, which [were] by the sea, heard that Enki had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the Israelites, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the Israelites.

<sup>2</sup> At that time Enki said unto Joshua, Make you sharp knives, and circumcise again the Israelites the second time. 

<sup>3</sup> Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the Israelites at the hill of the foreskins. 

<sup>4</sup> Joshua circumcised because all the males that came out of Egypt, [even] all the men of war, died in the wilderness along the way. <sup>5</sup> They were all circumcised. But all the people that were born in the wilderness had not been circumcised. 

<sup>6</sup> The Israelites walked 40 years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of Enki: unto whom Enki sware that he would not shew them the land, which Enki sware unto their
fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk
and honey. 

<sup>7</sup> Their children, [whom] he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way. 8} And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places
in the camp, till they were whole. 


9} And Enki said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of
Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is
called Gilgal unto this day.

10} The Israelites encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho. 11} They did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched [corn] in the selfsame day.

12 The manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the Israelites manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.

13} When Joshua was by Jericho, he saw a man with sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him, and asked:

{{< r a="Joshua" >}}
Are you friend or foe?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki-Agent" >}}
14 I am captain of the host of Enki. 
{{< /l >}}

Joshua fell on his face and worshipped him and said:

{{< r a="Joshua" >}}
What did Enki tell you? 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Enki-Agent" >}}
15 Loosen your shoe from off your foot. For the place where you stand on is holy.
{{< /l >}}


Joshua did so.
