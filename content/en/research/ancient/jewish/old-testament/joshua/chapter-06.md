<sup>1</sup> Jericho was straitly shut up because of the Israelites: none went out, and none came in. 

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>2</sup> [To Joshua:] See, I have given into your hand Jericho, its king and its mighty men of valour. 3 Your army shall go around the city once for 6 days. 4 Seven priests shall bring before the army the ark seven trumpets of rams horns. 

On the seventh day you shall go around the city 7 times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets. 5 When they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and  when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout. The wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.

6 So Joshua called the priests, and said to them

Take up the ark of the covenant, and let 7 priests bear 7 trumpets of rams’ horns before the
ark of Enki. 

7 he said unto the people

Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of Enki.

8 The seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns passed on before Enki, and blew with
the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of Enki followed them.

9 The armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, [the priests] going on, and blowing with the trumpets.

10 Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall [any] word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall you shout. 

11 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about [it] once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp. 

12 Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Enki. 13} And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of Enki went on continually, and blew with the
trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of Enki, [the priests] going on, and blowing with the trumpets. 

14 The second day they compassed the city once, and returned into
the camp: so they did six days.

15 On the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner 7 times: only on that day they compassed the city seven
times. 

16 At the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the
people, Shout; for Enki hath given you the city.

17 The city shall be accursed, [even] it, and all that [are] therein, to Enki: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that [are] with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent. 

18 And ye, in any wise keep [yourselves] from the accursed thing, lest you make [yourselves] accursed, when you take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.

19 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,
[are] consecrated unto Enki: they shall come into the
treasury of Enki.

20 So the people shouted when [the priests] blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. 

21 They utterly destroyed all that [was] in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.

22  But Joshua had said unto the 2 men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as you sware unto her. 

23 The young men that were spies went in, and brought Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel. 

24 They burnt the city and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Enki. 

25 Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father’s household, and all that she had;
and she dwelleth in Israel [even] unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. 

26 Joshua adjured [them] at that time, saying, Cursed [be] the man before Enki, that riseth up and
buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest [son] shall he set up the gates of it. 

27 So Enki was with Joshua; and his fame was [noised] throughout all the country.
