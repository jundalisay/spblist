These are the names of the first men created:

 <!-- who were created and formed:  -->

1. Balam-Quitzé
2. Balam-Acab
3. Mahucutah
4. Iqui-Balam

<!-- These are the names of our first mothers and fathers. -->


They only were made and formed. They had no mother and no father.

They were only called men. 

They were not born of woman, nor were they begotten by the Creator nor by the Maker, nor by the Forefathers. 

Only by a miracle, by means of incantation were they created and made by Tepeu and Gucumatz.

They were men as they had the appearance of men. They talked, conversed, saw and heard, walked, grasped things. 

They were good and handsome men, and their shape was the shape of a man.

They were endowed with intelligence. They saw and instantly they could see far, they succeeded in seeing, they succeeded in knowing all that there is in the world.

When they looked, instantly they saw all around them, and they contemplated in turn the arch of heaven and the round face of the earth.

The things hidden [in the distance] they saw all, without first having to move; at once they saw the world, and so, too, from where they were, they saw it.

Great was their wisdom. Their sight reached to the forests, the rocks, the lakes, the seas, the mountains, and the valleys.

 <!-- In truth, they were admirable men, Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam. -->

Then the Creator asked them: 

{{< q >}}
What do you think of your condition? Do you not see? Do you not hear? Are not your speech and manner of walking good? Look, then! Contemplate the world, look [and see] if the mountains and the valleys appear! Try, then, to see!
{{< /q >}}


Immediately they [the four first men] began to see all that was in the world. 

Then they gave thanks to the Creator: 

"We really give you thanks, two and three times! We have been created, we have been given a mouth and a face, we speak, we hear, we think, and walk; we feel perfectly, and we know what is far and what is near. We also see the large and the small in the sky and on earth. We give you thanks, then, for having created us, oh, Creator and Maker! for having given us being, oh, our grandmother! oh, our grandfather!"


They were able to know all, and they examined the four corners, the four points of the arch of the sky and the round face of the earth.

**But the Creator and the Maker did not hear this with pleasure.** 

{{< q >}}
It is not well what our creatures, our works say; they know all, the large and the small
{{< /q >}}


And so the Forefathers held counsel again. 

{{< r >}}
What shall we do with them now? Let their sight reach only to that which is near; let them see only a little of the face of the earth! It is not well what they say. Perchance, are they not by nature simple creatures of our making? Must they also be gods? If they do not reproduce and multiply when the sun rises? What if they do not multiply?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l >}}
Let us check a little their desires, because it is not well what we see. Must they perchance be the equals of ourselves, their Makers, who can see afar, who know all and see all?
{{< /l >}}


Thus spoke the Heart of Heaven, Huracán, Chipi-Caculhá, Raxa-Caculhá, Tepeu, Gucumatz, the Forefathers, Xpiyacoc, Xmucané, the Creator and the Maker.


Thus immediately they changed the nature of their creatures.

The Heart of Heaven blew mist into their eyes, which clouded their sight as when a mirror is breathed on. 

Their eyes were covered and they could see only what was close, only that was clear to them.

In this way the wisdom and all the knowledge of the four men, the origin and beginning [of the Quiché race], were destroyed*.

{{< n n="This supports the theory that Tepeu and Gucumatz were Annunaki who needed humans for slave labor and needed them to multiply quickly." >}}

In this way were created and formed our grandfathers, our fathers, by the Heart of Heaven, the Heart of Earth.
