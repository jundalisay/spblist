They stood at the forest's edge, gazing	at the top of the Cedar Tree gazing at the  entrance to the forest. 
  
Humbaba to Gilgamesh:

"You understand the rules of my forest and are aware of the things so ordered by Enlil. I should have killed you at the entrance of my forest. So now, Enkidu, clemency is up to you. Tell Gilgamesh to spare my life!"

Enkidu replied:
  
<!-- My  
  friend, 
  Humbaba,  
  Guardian  
  of  
  the 
  Cedar 
  Forest, 
  
grind 
  up, 
  kill, 
  pulverize(?), 
  and 
  destroy 
  him!   -->
  
Before the Preeminent God Enlil hears and the gods be filled with rage against us. 
  
Enlil is in Nippur. Shamash is in Sippar. Erect an eternal monument proclaiming how Gilgamesh killed Humbaba."

Enkidu spoke to Gilgamesh: "My friend we have cut down the towering Cedar whose top scrapes the sky. Make from it a door   72 cubits high, 24 cubits wide, 1 cubit thick. 

Its fixture, its lower and upper pivots will be out of 1  piece.  
  
Let them  carry it to  Nippur, the Euphrates will carry it down, Nippur will rejoice.  
  
They  tied together a raft... Enkidu  steered  it... while  Gilgamesh held the head of  Humbaba.
