"The god that we are going to is the wild bull Shamash, the protector,	
  
in	
  difficulties	
  he	
  holds	
  our	
  hand.	
  
The	
  one	
  who	
  gave	
  you	
  water	
  to	
  drink	
  from	
  his	
  waterskin	
  
is	
  your	
  personal)	
  god,	
  who	
  brings	
  honor	
  to	
  you,	
  Lugalbanda.	
  
We	
  should	
  join	
  together	
  and	
  do	
  one	
  thing,	
  
a	
  deed	
  such	
  as	
  has	
  never	
  (before)	
  been	
  done	
  in	
  the	
  land."	
  
	
  At	
  twenty	
  leagues	
  they	
  broke	
  for	
  some	
  food,	
  
at	
  thirty	
  leagues	
  they	
  stopped	
  for	
  the	
  night,	
  
walking	
  fifty	
  leagues	
  in	
  a	
  whole	
  day,	
  
a	
  walk	
  of	
  a	
  month	
  and	
  a	
  half.	
  
They	
  dug	
  a	
  well	
  facing	
  Shamash,	
  
Gilgamesh	
  climbed	
  up	
  a	
  mountain	
  peak,	
  
made	
  a	
  libation	
  of	
  flour,	
  and	
  said:	
  
"Mountain,	
  bring	
  me	
  a	
  dream,	
  a	
  favorable	
  message	
  from	
  
Shamash."	
  
Enkidu	
  prepared	
  a	
  sleeping	
  place	
  for	
  him	
  for	
  the	
  night;	
  
a	
  violent	
  wind	
  passed	
  through	
  so	
  he	
  attached	
  a	
  covering.	
  
He	
  made	
  him	
  lie	
  down,	
  and...	
  in	
  a	
  circle.
