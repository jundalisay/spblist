O Asari, [Marduk] "Bestower of planting," "Founder of sowing" "Creator of grain and plants," "who caused the green herb to spring up!"

"Who directed the decrees of Anu Bel, and Ea!"

He, whose provision is abundance, goeth forth...

Tutu [Marduk] is "He who created them anew";

Should their wants be pure, then are they satisfied;

Should he make an incantation, then are the gods appeased;

Should they attack him in anger, he withstandeth their onslaught!

Let him therefore be exalted, and in the assembly of the gods let him... ;

None among the gods can rival him!

15 Tutu [Marduk] is Zi-ukkina, "the Life of the host of the gods,"

Who established for the gods the bright heavens.

He set them on their way, and ordained their path;

Never shall his ... deeds be forgotten among men.

Tutu as Zi-azag thirdly they named, "the Bringer of Purification,"

"The God of the Favoring Breeze," "the Lord of Hearing and Mercy,"

"The Creator of Fulness and Abundance," " the Founder of Plenteousness,"

"Who increaseth all that is small."

In sore distress we felt his favoring breeze,"

Let them say, let them pay reverence, let them bow in humility before him!

Tutu as Aga-azag may mankind fourthly magnify!

"The Lord of the Pure Incantation," " the Quickener of the Dead,"

"Who had mercy upon the captive gods,"

"Who removed the yoke from upon the gods his enemies,"

"For their forgiveness did he create mankind,"

"The Merciful One, with whom it is to bestow life!"

May his deeds endure, may they never be forgotten ,

In the mouth of mankind whom his hands have made!

Tutu as Mu-azag, fifthly, his "Pure incantation" may their mouth proclaim,

Who through his Pure Incantation hath destroyed all the evil ones!"

Sag-zu, [Marduk] "who knoweth the heart of the gods," " who seeth through the innermost part!"

"Who put their plans to confusion,"

"Who destroyed all the wicked," "...,"

... let them... !

[There is a gap here of sixty lines. But somewhere among the lost lines belong the following fragments.]

who...

He named the 4 quarters of the world, mankind he created,

And upon him understanding...

"The mighty one...!"
Agil...

"The Creator of the earth...!"

Zulummu... .

"The Giver of counsel and of whatsoever...!"

Mummu, " the Creator of...!"

Mulil, the heavens...,

"Who for...!"

Giskul, let...,

"Who brought the gods to naught....!"

... " the Chief of all lords,"

... supreme is his might!

Lugal-durmah, "the King of the band of the gods," " the Lord of rulers."

"Who is exalted in a royal habitation,"

"Who among the gods is gloriously supreme!

Adu-nuna" the Counselor of Ea," who created the gods his fathers,

Unto the path of whose majesty

No god can ever attain!

... in Dul-azag be made it known,

... pure is his dwelling!

... the... of those without understanding is Lugaldul-azaga!

... supreme is his might!

... their... in the midst of Tiamat,

... of the battle!

[Here follows the better-preserved ending.]

... the star, which shined in the heavens.

May he hold the Beginning and the Future, may they pay homage unto him, Saying, 

"He who forced his way through the midst of Tiamat without resting,

Let his name be Nibiru, 'the Seizer of the Midst'!

For the stars of heaven he upheld the paths,

He shepherded all the gods like sheep!

He conquered Tiamat, he troubled and ended her life,"

In the future of mankind, when the days grow old,

May this be heard without ceasing; may it hold sway forever!

Since he created the realm of heaven and fashioned the firm earth,

The Lord of the World," the father Bel had called his name.

This title, which all the Spirits of Heaven proclaimed,

Did Ea [Enki?] hear, and his spirit was rejoiced, and he said:

"He whose name his fathers have made glorious,

Shall be even as I, his name shall be Ea [Enki]!

The binding of all my decrees shall he control,

All my commands shall he make known! "

By the name of "Fifty " did the great gods

Proclaim his fifty names, they, made his path preeminent.


## EPILOGUE

Let them [i.e. the names of Marduk] be held in remembrances and let the first man proclaim them;

Let the wise and the understanding consider them together!

Let the father repeat them and teach them to his son;

Let them be in the ears of the pastor and the shepherd!

Let a man rejoice in Marduk, the Lord of the gods,

That be may cause his land to be fruitful, and that he himself may have prosperity!

His word standeth fast, his command is unaltered;

The utterance of his mouth hath no god ever annulled.

He gazed in his anger, he turned not his neck;

When he is wroth, no god can withstand his indignation.

Wide is his heart, broad is his compassion;

The sinner and evil-doer in his presence...

They received instruction, they spake before him,
... unto...
... of Marduk may the gods...;
... May they ... his name... !
... they took and...
