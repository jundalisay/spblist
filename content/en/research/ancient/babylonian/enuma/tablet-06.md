When Marduk heard the word of the gods, his heart prompted him and he devised a cunning plan.

He told his plan to Ea [Enki]:

"My blood will I take and bone will I fashion I will make man, that man may I will create man who shall inhabit the earth.*

{{< n n="This is the creation of hominids, not Homo Sapiens" >}}

That the service of the gods may be established, and that their shrines may be built.

But I will alter the ways of the gods, and I will change their paths.

Together shall they be oppressed and unto evil shall they....

Ea answered him and spake the word:
"... the ... of the gods I have changed
... and one...
... shall be destroyed and men will I...
... and the gods .
... and they..."

[The rest of the text is wanting with the exception of the last few lines of the tablet, which read as follows.]

They rejoiced...

In Upsukkinnaku they set their dwelling.

Of the heroic son, their avenger, they cried:

"We, whom he succored.... !"

They seated themselves and in the assembly they named him...,

They all cried aloud, they exalted him...
