35. Any number of trains of light-waves of the same length*, travelling in the same direction has intensities and relative positions.

The intensity of the vibrations produced by the meeting of these different trains of loaves is the oscillatory velocity of the ether particles.

We shall only deal with waves of the same wavelength.

<!--  not here consider light-waves of different lengths which, in general, come from different sources and which cannot, therefore, give rise to simultaneous disturbances and cannot by their interaction produce any phenomena which are uniform. 


Even if they were uniform, the rise and fall of intensity produced by the interference of two different kinds of waves, after the manner of beats in sound, would be far toorapid to be detected, and would produce only a sensation of constant intensity.  -->

Thomas Young first introduced the principle of interference into optics. 

He only dealt with the difference in phase between the two trains of waves is either a maximum or a minimum.

<!-- But in the problems which he has thus solved he has considered, I think, only the limiting cases, where the  -->

He has not computed the intensity of the light for any intermediate cases or for any number of trains of waves, as I here propose to do. 

I use the general principle of the superposition of small motions.

The total velocity impressed on any fluid particle is equal to the sum of the velocities impressed by each train of waves acting by itself.

When these waves do not coincide, these different velocities depend on:
- the intensity of each wave
- its phase at the instant under consideration.

We must, therefore, know the law according to which the velocity of vibration varies in any one wave. 

We must trace the wave back to the origin whence it derives all its characteristics.


36. The particles whose vibrations produce light perform their oscillations like those of sounding bodies --  according to the laws which hold for the pendulum

We suppose that the acceleration tending to make a particle return to its position of equilibrium is directly proportional to the displacement.

Let us denote this displacement by `x`.

A suitable function of this displacement can then be represented by the expression

Ax + Bx* + Cxs -\-etc., since this will vanish when #=0. 

The excursion of the particle is very small when compared with the radius of the sphere throughout which the forces of attraction and repulsion act.

We can neglect incomparison with Ax all other terms of the series and consider the acceleration as practically proportional to the dis-tance x. 

This hypothesis, to which we are led by analogy,and which is the simplest that one can make concerning the vibrations of light particles, should lead to accurate results,since the laws of optics remain the same for all intensities of light.

Let `v` be the velocity of vibration of a light particle at the end of a time `t`.

We shall then have `dvAxdt`

But `v=dxldt`, or `dt=dx/v`.

Substituting in the first equation,we have vdvAxdx. Integrating, we have `v*=C Ax2`

Hence

...

Substituting this value of x in the first equation, we have

...

which, on integration, gives

...
<!-- VA Vc' -->


If we measure time from the instant at which the velocityis zero, the constant C' becomes zero, and we have

...

If we employ as unit of time the interval occupied by the particle in one complete vibration, we have v= VU sin (M).Thus, in isochronous vibrations, the velocities for equal valuesof t are always proportional to the constant V0, which, therefore, measures the intensity of the vibration.

37. What about the wave produced in the ether by the vibrations of this particle?

The energy of motion in the ether at any point on the wave depends on the velocity of the point-source at the instant when it started a disturbance which has just reached this point.

The velocity of the ether particles at any point in space after an interval of time `t` is proportional to that of the point-source at the instant `txl\,x` being the distance of this point from the source of motion and the length of a light-wave. 

Let us denote by u the velocity of the ether particles. 

We then have

...

We know that the intensity a of vibration* [oscillatory velocity] in a fluid is in inverse ratio to the distance of the wavefrom the centre of disturbance.

But, considering how minutethese waves are when compared with the distance which sep- arates them from the luminous point, we may neglect the variation of a and consider it as constant throughout the extentof one or even of several waves.


38. By the aid of this expression one can compute the intensity of vibration produced by the meeting of any number of pencils of light whenever he knows the intensity of the different trains of waves and their respective positions.

Let us first determine the velocity of a luminous particle in a vibration which results from the interference of two trains of waves displaced, one with respect to the other, by a quarter of a wave-length [i.e., differing in phase ~by 90], and having intensities which we shall denote by a and a'. We shallcount time, t, from the moment at which the vibrations of thefirst train begin. Let u and u' be the velocities which the first and second trains of waves would impress upon a light particlewhose distance from the source of motion is x. We then have

...

<!-- ua sin 2-*

Hence, the resultant velocity 7 will be a 

<!-- sin ^TT It -- I a' cos 2?r 1 1 --

Putting a =A cos i and a' =A sin i, this expression may alwaysbe placed in the following form : 

<!-- A cos i sin 2-n- It
j \A sin i cos 2* If

, or A sin \2TT ( ^ ) i
' .  -->

Thus the wave produced by the meeting of two others will beof the same nature, but will have a different position [phase]and a different intensity. 

From the equations A cos i=a andA sin i=a', we have for the value of A (that is, for the in-tensity of the resultant wave) 

<!-- -v/rt
2 _j_#'

;  -->

But this is exactly thevalue of the resultant of two mutually rectangular forces, aand a'. From the same equations it is easily seen also that the newwave exactly corresponds in angular position [phase] to ,theresultant of the two mutually rectangular forces a and a'; forthe equation

<!-- U=A sin  -->

shows that the linear displacement of this wave with respecti\ to the first is ; but i is also the angle which the force a makes with the resultant A, because A cos i a.

Thus wehave complete analogy between the resultant of two mutuallyrectangular forces and the resultant of two trains of waves dif fering in phase by a quarter of a wave-length.

39. The solution of this particular case for waves differing by a quarter of a wave-length suffices to solve all other cases. 

In fact, whatever be the number of the trains of waves, andwhatever be the intervals which separate them, we can alwayssubstitute for each of them its components referred to two ref- erence points which are common to each train of waves and whichare distant from each other by a quarter of a wave-length; 

Then adding or subtracting, according to sign, the intensities of the components referred to the same point, we may reduce the whole motion to that of two trains of waves separated by the distance of a quarter of a wave-length; and the square root of the sum of the squares of their intensities will be the intensity of their resultant; 

But this is exactly the method employed in statics to ftrid the resultant of any number of forces ; here the wave-length corresponds to one circumference in the statical problem, and the interval of a quarter of a wavelength between the trains of waves to an angular displacementof 90 between the components.

40. It very often happens in optics that the intensities of light or the particular tint which one wishes to compute is produced by the meeting of only two trains of waves, as in the case of [Newton's] colored rings and the ordinary phenomena of color presented by crystalline plates.

It is, therefore, well to know the general expression for the resultant of two trains of waves differing in phase by any amount whatever. 

The result is easily predicted from the general method which I haveexplained, but I think it will be wise to emphasize somewhatthe theory of vibrations, and to show directly that the waveresulting from two others, separated by any interval whatever, corresponds exactly in intensity and position to the resultant
of two forces whose intensities are equal to those of the two pencils of light, making an angle with each other which bears to one complete circumference the same ratio that the interval between the two trains of waves bears to one wavelength.

Let x be the distance from the origin of the first train of waves to the light particle under consideration, and t the instant for which we wish to compute its velocity. The speedimpressed by the first train of waves will be a sin [fc (<-)], where a represents the intensity of this ray of light. 

<!-- Let us call a' the intensity of the second pencil, and let usdenote by c the distance between corresponding points on thetwo trains of waves; the [oscillatory] velocity due to the secondtrain will then be
