{{< sup v="72" >}} A man said to him, "Tell my brothers to divide my father's possessions with me."

Jesus replied "O man, who has made me a divider?"

{{< sup v="76" >}} "The kingdom of the father is like a merchant who had a consignment of merchandise and who discovered a pearl. That merchant was shrewd.

{{< sup v="77" >}} "It is I who am the light which is above them all. It is I who am the all. From me did the all come forth, and unto me did the all extend. Split a piece of wood, and I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there."

{{< sup v="78" >}} "Why have you come out into the desert? To see a reed shaken by the wind? And to see a man clothed in fine garments like your kings and your great men? Upon them are the fine garments, and they are unable to discern the truth."

<sup>79</sup> A woman from the crowd said to him, "Blessed are the womb which bore you and the breasts which nourished you."

He said to her:

"Blessed are those who have heard the word of the father and have truly kept it. For there will be days when you will say, 'Blessed are the womb which has not conceived and the breasts which have not given milk.'"

much you will have to bear!"

He said to them, "You read the face of the sky and of the earth, but you have not recognized the one who is before you, and you do not know how to read this moment."

<sup>92</sup> Seek and you will find. Yet, what you asked me about in former times and which I did not tell you then, now I do desire to tell, but you do not inquire after it.

<sup>93</sup> Do not give what is holy to dogs, lest they throw them on the dungheap. Do not throw the pearls to swine, lest they [...] it [...].

<sup>94</sup> He who seeks will find, and he who knocks will be let in.

<sup>95</sup> If you have money, do not lend it at interest. Give it to one from whom you will not get it back.

When she reached her house, she set the jar down and found it empty."
