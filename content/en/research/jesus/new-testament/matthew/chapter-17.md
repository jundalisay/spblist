<sup>1</sup> After 6 days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into an high mountain.

<sup>2</sup> He was transfigured before them: his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. 

<sup>3</sup> There appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with him. 

{{< r a="Peter" >}}
<sup>4</sup> Lord, it is good for us to be here. Allow us to make here 3 tabernacles: one for you, Moses, and Elias.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>5</sup> While he was speaking a bright cloud overshadowed them. A voice out of the cloud, which said:

{{< r a="Enlil" >}}
This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>6</sup> When the disciples heard [it,] they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.

<sup>7</sup> Jesus came and touched them, and said, 

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Arise, and be not afraid. 
{{< /l >}}

<sup>8</sup> When they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only. <sup>9</sup> As they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying:

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Disciples" >}}
<sup>10</sup> Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come? 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>11</sup> Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things. 

<sup>12</sup> But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them. 
{{< /l >}}

<sup>13</sup> Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.

<sup>14</sup> When they were come to people, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him:

{{< r a="Man" >}}
<sup>15</sup> Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water. <sup>16</sup> I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him. 
{{< /r >}}


<sup>17</sup> O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him to me.

<sup>18</sup>  Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour. 

{{< r a="Disciples" >}}
<sup>19</sup>  Why could not we cast him out?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>20</sup>  Because of your unbelief: If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.

{17:21} Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.

{17:22} And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of
men: {17:23} And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.

{17:24} And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute [money] came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute? {17:25} He saith, Yes. 

When he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings
of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?

{17:26} Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free. 

{17:27} Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh
up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and
thee.
