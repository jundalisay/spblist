{18:1} At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus,
saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?

{18:2} And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, {18:3} And said, Verily I say unto
you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. {18:4}
Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

{18:5} Whoso shall receive one such little child in my name
receiveth me. {18:6} But whoso shall offend one of these
little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a
millstone were hanged about his neck, and [that] he were
drowned in the depth of the sea.

{18:7} Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by
whom the offence cometh! {18:8} Wherefore if thy hand or
thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast [them] from
thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed,
rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into
everlasting fire. 

{18:9} And if thine eye offend thee, pluck
it out, and cast [it] from thee: it is better for thee to enter
into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast
into hell fire. {18:10} Take heed that ye despise not one of
these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their
angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in
heaven. 

{18:11} For the Son of man is come to save that
which was lost.

{18:12} How think ye? if a man have an
hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not
leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and
seeketh that which is gone astray? {18:13} And if so be that
he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that
[sheep,] than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.

{18:14} Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in
heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.

{18:15} Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against
thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone:
if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. {18:16}
But if he will not hear [thee, then] take with thee one or two
more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every
word may be established.

{18:17} And if he shall neglect to
hear them, tell [it] unto the church: but if he neglect to hear
the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a
