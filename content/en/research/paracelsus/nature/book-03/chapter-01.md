That things may bee preserved, and kept from harm, it is necessary in the first place to know what is an enemie to them, that so they may be preserved from that, & not be hurt, or corrupted by it either in substance, virtue, power, or any way whatsoever. Much therefore in this case depends upon the knowing of the Enemie of all Naturall things. For who can take he d of danger when he  doth not know what can hurt him?

Truly no body; Wherefore it is necessary to know ones Enemie, For there are many sorts of Enemies. Wherefore it is as necessary to know evill things, as good things: for who can know what is good, without the knowing of what is evill? Truly no body. So no man can know what a blessing health is, that was never sick. Who knows what joy is, that was never heavy, or sad? 

Who can rightly understand what God is, who knew nothing of the Devil? Death is the enemie of things.Wherefore when God made known to us the Enemie of our Soul, viz. the Devill, he also signified to us the Enemie of our life, viz. Death, which is the Enemie of our body, of our health, and the Enemie of Medicinall, and all naturall things: also he made known to us how, and by which means it may be shunned. 

There is a Contrariety found in all things.For as there is no disease against which there is not created, and found some remedy, which should cure, and expell it: so also there is always one thing ordained against another, one Water against another, one Stone against another, one Minerall against another, one Poison against another, one Metall against another: and so in many more things, all which it is not requisite here to recite.

Now how, and by what means every thing is to bee preserved, and kept from hurt, wee must know, that many things are to bee preserved in the Earth, and especially all rootes doe for a long time remaine in the Earth without losing their virtue, or being corrupted: in like manner herbs, flowers, and all fruites continue in the water incorrupted, and green: there are also many fruits, and apples that may be preserved in water from all manner of putrefaction, untill new fruit come againe.


## How to preserve flesh and blood.

So also flesh, and blood, which indeed are putrefied, and grow unsavoury quickly, are preserved in cold fountain-water, and not only so, but by the addition of new and fresh fountaine-water, may be turned into a quintessence, and bee forever preserved from putrefaction, and an ill savour, without any balsome. And this doth not only preserve the flesh, and blood of dead things, but also of the living, wherefore Mans body may bee preserved from all manner of putrefaction, and divers diseases that proceed from putrefaction, better then common Mummie. Now that blood may be preserved of it self from putrefaction, and stinking, and not as a quintessence, & so as it may preserve the blood of the living (as we now said) you must follow this processe.

How the Arcanum of mans blood is to be prepared.
Let the blood bee separated from its flegm, which is separated of its self, and is driven to the upper part. This water poure gently out of the vessell, and in stead of it put as much of the water of the salt of blood, which water wee teach to make in our Chirurgerie: That water doth presently mixe with the blood, and preserves it so, that it will never bee putrefied, or grow unsavory, but continue many years as fresh, and very red as it was the first day: and this indeed is a great wonder. But if you dost not know how to make this water, or hast it not in readiness, then poure upon it so much of the best, and most excellent balsome, and this will doe the same. Now, this blood is the balsome of balsomes, and is called the Arcanum of blood, and it is so wonderful, and of such great virtue, that it is incredible to be spoken; wherefore you shalt conceale it as a great secret in Physick.
