At last he begins to curse Mercury, and revile Nature because she made him.

Nature heard these things and called Mercury to her, and said to him: 

{{< r a="Nature" >}}
What had you done to this man? Why does he curse and revile me for thy sake? Why don't you do what you should do? 
{{< /r >}}


But Mercury modestly excuseth himself. Yet Nature commands him to be obedient to the sons of Wisdome, that seek after him. Mercury promised that he will, and saith: 


{{< r a="Mercury" >}}
Mother Nature, but who can satisfy fools? 
{{< /r >}}


Nature went away smiling.

But Mercury being angry with the Alchymist goes also unto his own place. After a few days the Alchymist thought that he omitted something. He again began to mix Mercury with hogs dung.

But Mercury was angry that he was falsly accused before his mother Nature, and said to the Alchymist:

{{< r a="Mercury" >}}
Why did you accuse me? Are you blind? You cannot even see yourself!
{{< /r >}}


<!-- l a="Alchemist" >}}
Art you he that I have longed to see? 

r a="Mercury" >}}
I am, but no man that is blind can see me. 

l a="Alchemist" >}}
I am not blind.  -->


{{< l a="Alchemist" >}}
O now you art proud, I speak civilly to thee, and you contemnest me. I have worked with many Princes, and was esteemed as a Philosopher amongst them. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Mercury" >}}
Fools flock to Princes Courts, for there they are honoured, and fare better then others. Wast you also at the Court? 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Alchemist" >}}
O you art a devill, and not a good Mercury, if you wilt speak thus to Philosophers: for before you didst also seduce me thus. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Mercury" >}}
Do you know Philosophers? 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Alchemist" >}}
I myself am a Philosopher. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Mercury" >}}
Behold our Philosopher (smiling said: and began to talke further with him saying) My Philosopher, tell me therefore what you seekest after, and what you wilt have, what dost you desire to make?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Alchemist" >}}
The Philosophers stone. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Mercury" >}}
Out of what matter will you make it? 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Alchemist" >}}
Out of our Mercury. 
{{< /l >}}
At last he begins to curse Mercury, and revile Nature because she made him.

Nature heard these things and called Mercury to her, and said to him: 

{{< r a="Nature" >}}
What hast you done to this man? Why doth he curse and revile me for thy sake? Why dost not you doe what you oughtest to doe? 
{{< /r >}}

But Mercury modestly excuseth himself. Yet Nature commands him to be obedient to the sons of Wisdome, that seek after him. Mercury promiseth that he will, and saith: 

{{< r a="Mercury" >}}
Mother Nature, but who can satisfie fools? 
{{< /r >}}

Nature went away smiling.

But Mercury being angry with the Alchymist goes also unto his own place. After a few days it came into the Alchymists mind, that he omitted something in his operations, and again he  hath recourse to Mercury, and now resolves to mix him with hogs dung.

But Mercury was angry that he had falsly accused him before his mother Nature, saith to the Alchymist:

What wilt you have of me you foole? Why hast you thus accused me? 

{{< l a="Alchemist" >}}
Art you he that I have longed to see? 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Mercury" >}}
I am, but no man that is blind can see me. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Alchemist" >}}
I am not blind. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Mercury" >}}
You are very blind, for you canst not see thy self, how then canst you see me? 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Alchemist" >}}
O now you art proud, I speak civilly to thee, and you contemnest me: you dost not know perhaps that I have worked with many Princes, and was esteemed as a Philosopher amongst them. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Mercury" >}}
