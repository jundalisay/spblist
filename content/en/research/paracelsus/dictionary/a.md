Archeius is the highest, exalted, and invisible spirit, which is separated from bodies, is exalted, and ascends, the universall occult nature, operator, and Physitian in all things. So Archiatrus is the supream Physitian of Nature, which distributes to every thing and every member their peculiar Archeius occultly by Ares. Also Archeius is the first in Nature, the most secret virtue, producing all things out of Iliaste, being supported by a divine power. Ares is the dispenser of Nature hid in all the three principles, whence every thing hath its being, and which disposeth to all things in a particular form, shape, and substance, that it may put on its own proper specifical nature, & not anothers. But you must note, the difference betwixt these 3 in nature, to speak after the manner of schools. Iliastes is the substance of the highest genus, or kind consisting in the first universall matter of all things, which it doth first dispose into three kinds, viz. into Sulphur, Mercury, and salt. The Archeius is the first dispenser of Nature, and then it produceth all things into its next genera or kinds.

Asthma is a disease of the lungs causing difficulty of breathing.

Astrum is in this place called the virtue and power got by the preparations of things as the star of Sulphur is its inflaming which is turned into most excellent oyle: so the star of salt is its resolution into water, or oyle, which thereby receives more virtues then it had before.
