<!-- Now that we must reflect in terms of natural philosophy about the causes of these creatures we must remember the facts, all the points, many of which have been discussed in the previous treatises. We need not repeat them here. Further causes that may be explored are these: namely, that  -->

God has set guardians over nature, for all things. He left nothing unguarded. 

Thus gnomes, pygmies and mani guard the treasures of the earth, the metals and similar treasures. 

Where they are, there are tremendous treasures, in tremendous quantities. 

They are guarded by such people, are kept hidden and secret so that they may not be found until the time for it has come. 

When they are found, people say: in times of old there used to be mountain manikins, earth people here, but now they are gone. 

This means that now the time has come for the treasures to be revealed. The treasures of the earth are distributed in such a way that the metals, silver, gold, iron, etc., have been found from the beginning of the world on, and are being discovered by and by. 

They are guarded and protected by these people so that they may not be found all at once, but one after another, by and by, now in this country, now in another. 

Thus, the mines are shifted in the course of time from country to country and are distributed from the first day to the last. 

The same applies also to the fire people. They too are guardians, of the fireplaces, in which they live. 

In these places the treasures, that others guard, are forged, prepared, made ready. 

When the fire is extinguished, it is the earth manikins' turn to be on guard. 

After the earth manikins' guard, the treasures are revealed. It is the same with the air people. 

They guard the rocks that lie on the surface, that have been made by the fire people, and put at the place where they belong, from where they get into man's hands. 

They guard them so long, until the time has come. Wherever there are treasures, such people are on hand. These are hidden treasures that must not be revealed yet. 

Such guardians are not endowed with a soul, yet similar to and like men. 

The nymphs in the water are guardians of the great water treasures, that lie in the sea and other waters, that have also been melted and forged by the fire people. 

It is, therefore, commonly understood that where nymphs are, there are considerable treasures and minerals and similar matters which they guard. This is apparent in many ways.

The cause of the sirens, giants, dwarfs, also of the will-o'-the-wisps, who are monsters of the fire people, is that they predict and indicate something new. 

**They are not on guard, but signify that misfortune is threatening people.** 

Thus, when lights are seen it means the impending downfall of that country, that is, it commonly signifies the destruction of the monarchy and similar things. 

Thus, the giants also signify great impending destruction of that country and land or some other such great disaster. 

The dwarfs signify great poverty among the people, in many parts. 

The sirens signify the downfall of princes and lords, the rise of sects or factions. 

God wants us all to be of one essence.  What is against it, God drops. When this is going to happen, signs occur. 

These beings are such signs but not the only signs. There are many more.

You must know that the signs change each time. They do not appear in one way, but are hidden to our eyes.

The last cause is unknown to us. 

But when the end of the world will come close, everything that is in the world will be disclosed and come to light. Then, the fake scholars will be exposed, those who are highly learned in name only but know nothing by experience. 

<!-- , then all things will be revealed, from the smallest to the largest, from the first to the last, what everything has been and is, why it stood there and left, from what causes, and what its meaning was. -->


Then, the thorough scholars and those who are mere talkers will be recognized for what they are, those who wrote truthfully and those who traded in lies, the thorough and the shallow ones. 

And to each will be measured according to his diligence, earnest endeavor and truth. At that place, not everyone will be or remain a master, or even a doctor, because there the tares will be separated from the wheat and the straw from the grain. 

He who now cries, will be quieted, and he who now counts the pages, will have his quills taken away. And all things will be revealed before the Day of Judgment breaks, order that it be found of all scholars, from the past to that very day, who had knowledge and who not, whose writings were right and whose wrong. 

Now, in my time, this is still unknown. 

Blessed will be the people, in those days, whose intelligence will be revealed, for what they produced will be revealed to all the people as if it were written on their foreheads. For that time I also recommend my writings for judgment, asking that nothing be withheld. 

Thus it will be, for God makes the light manifest, that is, everyone will see how it has shone.
