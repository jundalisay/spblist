DIAGRAMS OF EQUIPOTENTIAL SURFACES.

This historical knowledge of results can be turned to account in two ways. If we are required to devise an instrument for making electrical measurements with the greatest accuracy, we may select those forms for the electrified sur- faces which correspond to cases of which we know the accurate solution. If, on the other hand, we are required to estimate what will be the electrifica- tion of bodies whose forms are given, we may begin with some case in which one of the equipotential surfaces takes a form somewhat resembling the given form, and then by a tentative method we may modify the problem till it more nearly corresponds to the given case. This method is evidently very imper- fect, considered from a mathematical point of view, but it is the only one we have, and if we are not allowed to choose our conditions, we can make only an approximate calculation of the electrification. It appears, therefore, that what we want is a knowledge of the forms of equipotential surfaces and lines of induction in as many different cases as we can collect together and remember. In certain classes of cases, such as those relating to spheres, we may proceed by mathematical methods. In other cases we cannot afford to despise the humbler method of actually drawing tentative figures on paper, and selecting that which appears least unlike the figure we require. This latter method, I think, may be of some use, even in cases in which the exact solution has been obtained, for I find that an eye knowledge of the forms of the equipotential surfaces often leads to a right selection of a mathematical method of solution.

I have therefore drawn several diagrams of systems of equipotential sur-
faces and lines of force, so that the student may make himself familiar with
the forms of the lines.

93.] In the first plate at the end of this volume we have the equipotential
surfaces surrounding two points electrified with quantities of electricity of the
same kind and in the ratio of 20 to 5.
Here each point is surrounded by a system of equipotential surfaces which
become more nearly spheres as they become smaller, but none of them are
accurately spheres. If two of these surfaces, one surrounding each sphere, be
taken to represent the surfaces of two conducting bodies, nearly but not quite
spherical, and if these bodies be charged with the same kind of electricity,
the charges being as 4 to 1, then the diagram will represent the equipotential surfaces, provided we expunge all those which are drawn inside the 2 bodies.

It appears from the diagram that the action between the bodies will
be the same as that between two points having the same charges, these points
being not exactly in the middle of the axis of each body, but somewhat more
remote than the middle point from the other body.

The same diagram enables us to see what will be the distribution of elec-
tricity on one of the oval figures, larger at one end than the other, which
surround both centres. Such a body, if electrified with a charge 25 and free
from external influence, will have the surface-density greatest at the small
end, less at the large end, and least in a circle somewhat nearer the smaller
than the larger end.

There is one equipotential surface, indicated by a dotted line, which con-
sists of two lobes meeting at the conical point P. That point is a point of
equilibrium, and the surface-density on a body of the form of this surface
would be zero at this point.
The lines of force in this case form two distinct systems, divided from one
another by a surface of the sixth degree, indicated by a dotted line, passing
through the point of equilibrium, and somewhat resembling one sheet of the
hyperboloid of two sheets.

This diagram may also be taken to represent the lines of force and equipo-
tential surfaces belonging to two spheres of gravitating matter whose masses
are as 4 to 1.

94.] In the second Plate we have again two points whose charges are as 4 to
1, but the one positive and the other negative. In this case one of the equipo-
tential surfaces, that, namely, corresponding to potential zero, is a sphere.
It is marked in the diagram by the dotted circle Q. The importance of this
spherical surface will be seen when we come to the theory of Electrical Im-
ages.

We may see from this diagram that if two round bodies are charged with
opposite kinds of electricity they will attract each other as much as two points
having the same charges but placed somewhat nearer together than the middle
points of the round bodies.
Here, again, one of the equipotential surfaces, indicated by a dotted line,
has two lobes, an inner one surrounding the point whose charge is 5 and an outer one surrounding both bodies, the two lobes meeting in a conical point
P which is a point of equilibrium.

If the surface of a conductor is of the form of the outer lobe, a roundish
body having, like an apple, a conical dimple at one end of its axis, then,
if this conductor be electrified, we shall be able to determine the superficial
density at any point. That at the bottom of the dimple will be zero.
Surrounding this surface we have others having a rounded dimple which
flattens and finally disappears in the equipotential surface passing through
the point marked M.

The lines of force in this diagram form two systems divided by a surface
which passes through the point of equilibrium.
If we consider points on the axis on the further side of the point B, we find
that the resultant force diminishes to the double point P, where it vanishes. It
then changes sign, and reaches a maximum at M, after which it continually
diminishes.

This maximum, however, is only a maximum relatively to other points on
the axis, for if we draw a surface perpendicular to the axis, M is a point of
minimum force relatively to neighbouring points on that surface.
95.] Plate III represents the equipotential surfaces and lines of force due to
an electrified point whose charge is 10 placed at A, and surrounded by a field
of force, which, before the introduction of the electrified point, was uniform
in direction and magnitude at every part. In this case, those lines of force
which belong to A are contained within a surface of revolution which has an
asymptotic cylinder, having its axis parallel to the undisturbed lines of force.
The equipotential surfaces have each of them an asymptotic plane. One of
them, indicated by a dotted line, has a conical point and a lobe surrounding
the point A. Those below this surface have one sheet with a depression near
the axis. Those above have a closed portion surrounding A and a separate
sheet with a slight depression near the axis.

If we take one of the surfaces below A as the surface of a conductor, and
another a long way below A as the surface of another conductor at a different
potential, the system of lines and surfaces between the two conductors will
indicate the distribution of electric force. If the lower conductor is very far
from A its surface will be very nearly plane, so that we have here the solution of the distribution of electricity on two surfaces, both of them nearly plane and parallel to each other, except that the upper one has a protuberance near
its middle point, which is more or less prominent according to the particular
equipotential line we choose for the surface.

96.] Plate IV represents the equipotential surfaces and lines of force due to
three electrified points A, B and C, the charge of A being 15 units of positive
electricity, that of B 12 units of negative electricity, and that of C 20 units of
positive electricity. These points are placed in one straight line, so that
AB = 9,
BC = 16,
AC = 25.

In this case, the surface for which the potential is unity consists of two
spheres whose centres are A and C and their radii 15 and 20. These spheres
intersect in the circle which cuts the plane of the paper in D and D′ , so that
B is the centre of this circle and its radius is 12. This circle is an example
of a line of equilibrium, for the resultant force vanishes at every point of this
line.

If we suppose the sphere whose centre is A to be a conductor with a charge
of 3 units of positive electricity, and placed under the influence of 20 units
of positive electricity at C, the state of the case will be represented by the
diagram if we leave out all the lines within the sphere A. The part of this
spherical surface within the small circle DD′ will be negatively electrified
by the influence of C. All the rest of the sphere will be positively electrified,
and the small circle DD′ itself will be a line of no electrification.
We may also consider the diagram to represent the electrification of the
sphere whose centre is C, charged with 8 units of positive electricity, and
influenced by 15 units of positive electricity placed at A.
The diagram may also be taken to represent the case of a conductor whose
surface consists of the larger segments of the two spheres meeting in DD′ ,
charged with 23 units of positive electricity.
97.] I am anxious that these diagrams should be studied as illustrations
of the language of Faraday in speaking of ‘lines of force,’ the ‘forces of an
electrified body,’ &c.

In strict mathematical language the word Force is used to signify the supposed cause of the tendency which a material body is found to have towards alteration in its state of rest or motion. It is indifferent whether we speak of
this observed tendency or of its immediate cause, since the cause is simply
inferred from the effect, and has no other evidence to support it.

Since, however, we are ourselves in the practice of directing the motion of
our own bodies, and of moving other things in this way, we have acquired a
copious store of remembered sensations relating to these actions, and there-
fore our ideas of force are connected in our minds with ideas of conscious
power, of exertion, and of fatigue, and of overcoming or yielding to pressure.
These ideas, which give a colouring and vividness to the purely abstract idea
of force, do not in mathematically trained minds lead to any practical error.
But in the vulgar language of the time when dynamical science was un-
known, all the words relating to exertion, such as force, energy, power, &c.,
were confounded with each other, though some of the schoolmen endeavoured
to introduce a greater precision into their language.

The cultivation and popularization of correct dynamical ideas since the
time of Galileo and Newton have effected an immense change in the language
and ideas of common life, but it is only within recent times, and in conse-
quence of the increasing importance of machinery, that the ideas of force, en-
ergy and power have become accurately distinguished from each other. Very
few, however, even of scientific men, are careful to observe these distinctions;
hence we often hear of the force of a cannon-ball when either its energy or
its momentum is meant, and of the force of an electrified body when the
quantity of its electrification is meant.

Now the quantity of electricity in a body is measured, according to Fara-
day’s ideas, by the number of lines of force, or rather of induction, which
proceed from it. These lines of force must all terminate somewhere, either
on bodies in the neighbourhood, or on the walls and roof of the room, or on
the earth, or on the heavenly bodies, and wherever they terminate there is a
quantity of electricity exactly equal and opposite to that on the part of the
body from which they proceeded. By examining the diagrams this will be
seen to be the case. There is therefore no contradiction between Faraday’s
views and the mathematical result of the old theory, but, on the contrary, the
idea of lines of force throws great light on these results, and seems to afford
the means of rising by a continuous process from the somewhat rigid conceptions of the old theory to notions which may be capable of greater expansion, so as to provide room for the increase of our knowledge by further researches.
