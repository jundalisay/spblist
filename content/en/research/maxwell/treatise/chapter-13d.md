These researches confirm the statement of Faraday that the electric tension (see Art. 46) required to cause a disruptive discharge to begin at the electrified surface of a conductor is a little less when the electrification is negative than when it is positive, but that when a discharge does take place, much more electricity passes at each discharge when it begins at a positive surface. They also tend to support the hypothesis, that the stratum of gas condensed on the surface of the electrode plays an important part in the phenomenon, and they indicate that this condensation is greatest at the positive electrode. Note on Wheatstone’s Bridge.

[The following method of determining the current in the Galvanometer of Wheatstone’s Bridge was given by Professor Maxwell in his last course of lectures, and is a good illustration of the method of treating a system of linear conductors. It has been communicated to the present editor by Professor J. A. Fleming of University College, Nottingham. The method simply assumes Ohm’s Law for each conductor, and that the whole electromotive force around a linear circuit is the sum of the electromotive forces in the several conductors forming the circuits, and therefore equal to the sum of the products of the resistance of each conductor and the current flowing in it, the currents being taken in cyclic order.

Let P, Q, S, R, G and B (Fig. 53) denote the resistances in the several
conductors forming the bridge, and let them be arranged as indicated in the
figure. Now the six conductors may be considered as forming three independent circuits viz.:—P GQ, RSG, and QSB. Let x + y, y and z denote the currents in these circuits respectively, each current being considered as flow-
ing in the directions indicated by the arrows. Then the actual current in Q is
z − x − y, that in S is z − y and that in G, is x, and the electromotive force
between the ends of Q is Q(z − y − x) and so on for the other conductors. Of
the three circuits specified above the E. M. F. in the first two is zero while
that in the third is E, the electromotive force of the battery. Hence, applying

To obtain the current equations, (I), the rule is—
‘Multiply each cycle sign (i.e. current) by the sum of all the resistances
which bound that cycle, and subtract from it the sign of each neighbouring
cycle multiplied by the resistance separating the cycles, and equate the result
to the E. M. F. in the cycle.’
It will be seen that the method is a simple application of Kirchhoff’s second
law, but the above rule is very convenient in its application.]
