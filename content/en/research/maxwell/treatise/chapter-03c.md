In the notation of the differential calculus this result is expressed by the
equation

dE
in which it is to be remembered that all the charges but one are maintained
constant.
34.] Returning to equation (2), we have already shewn that
Q = 12 ∑(EP )
and Q′ = 12 ∑(E ′ P ′ );
(5)
we may therefore write equation (2)
1
(E ′ P ′ ) = 12 ∑(EP ) + 12 ∑(E ′ P ′ − EP + E ′ P − EP ′ ).

## Theorem 3

{{< q >}}
In a fixed system of conductors the sum of the products of the original charge and the final potential of each conductor is equal to the sum of the products of the final charge and the original potential. This theorem corresponds, in the elementary treatment of electrostatics, to Green’s Theorem in the analytical theory. By properly choosing the original and the final state of the system we may deduce a number of results which we shall find useful in our after-work.

35.] In the first place we may write, as before,
1
{(E ′ − E)(P ′ + P )} = 12 ∑(E ′ P ′ − EP + E ′ P − EP ′ );

adding and subtracting the equal quantities of equation (7),

and the right-hand side becomes

(E ′ P ′ − EP − E ′ P + EP ′ ),

or
1
{(E ′ − E)(P ′ + P )} = Q′ − Q = 12 ∑{(E ′ + E)(P ′ − P )},

## Theorem 4

{{< q >}}
The increment of the energy of a fixed system of conductors is equal to half the sum of the products of the increment of the potential of each conductor into the sum of the original and final charges of that conductor.

36.] If all the conductors but one are maintained at constant potentials (which may be done by connecting them with voltaic batteries of constant electromotive force), equation (11) is reduced to

or
Q′ − Q = 12 (E ′ + E)(P ′ − P ),(12)
Q′ − Q 1 ′
= 2 (E + E).
P′ − P(13)

If the increment of the potential is taken successively smaller and smaller,
till it ultimately vanishes, E ′ becomes at last equal to E and the equation
may be interpreted thus:—

The rate of increase of the electrical energy due to the increase of potential
of one of the conductors at a rate unity is numerically equal to the charge of
that conductor.
In the notation of the differential calculus this result is expressed by the
equation
dQp
= E,

PRECIPROCITY OF POTENTIALS.

in which it is to be remembered that all the potentials but one are maintained
constant.
37.] We have next to point out some of the results which may be deduced
from Theorem III.
If any conductor, as At , is insulated and without charge both in the initial
and the final state, then Et = 0 and Et ′ = 0, and therefore
Et Pt ′ = 0
and Et ′ Pt = 0,
(15)
so that the terms depending on At disappear from both members of equation
(7).
Again, if another conductor, say Au , be connected with the earth both in
the initial and in the final state, Pu = 0 and Pu ′ = 0, so that
Eu Pu ′ = 0
and
Eu ′ Pu = 0;
so that, in this case also, the terms depending on Au disappear from both
sides of equation (7).
If, therefore, all the conductors with the exception of two, say Ar and As ,
are either insulated and without charge, or else connected with the earth,
equation (7) is reduced to the form
Er Pr ′ + Es Ps ′ = Er ′ Pr + Es ′ Ps .
(16)
Let us first suppose that in the initial state all the conductors except Ar are
without charge, and that in the final state all the conductors except As are
without charge. The equation then becomes
Er P r ′ = E s ′ P s ,
or

Theorem V.

In a system of fixed insulated conductors, the potential (Ps ) produced in
As by a charge E communicated to Ar is equal to the potential (Pr ′ )
produced in Ar by an equal charge E communicated to As .
This is the first instance we have met with of the reciprocal relation of two
bodies. There are many such reciprocal relations. They occur in every branch
of science, and they often enable us to deduce the solution of new electrical
problems from those of simpler problems with which we are already familiar.
Thus, if we know the potential which an electrified sphere produces at a point
in its neighbourhood, we can deduce the effect which a small electrified body,
placed at that point, would have in raising the potential of the sphere.
38.] Let us next suppose that the original potential of As is Ps and that
all the other conductors are kept at potential zero by being connected with
the walls of the room, and let the final potential of Ar be Pr ′ , that of all the
others being zero, then in equation (7) all the terms involving zero potentials
will vanish, and we shall have in this case also
Er P r ′ = E s ′ P s .
If, therefore,
Pr ′ = Ps ,
Er = Es ′ ,
(18)
(19)
or in words,
Theorem VI.

In a system of fixed conductors, connected, all but one, with the walls of the
room, the charge (Er ) induced on Ar when As is raised to the potential
Ps is equal to the charge (Es ′ ) induced on As when Ar is raised to an
equal potential (Pr ′ ).
39.] As a third case, let us suppose all the conductors insulated and without
charge, and that a charge is communicated to Ar which raises its potential to
Pr and that of As to Ps . Next, let As be connected with the earth, and let a
charge Er ′ on Ar induce the charge Es ′ on As .GREEN’S THEOREM ON POTENTIALS AND CHARGES.
36
In equation (16) we have Er = 0 and Ps ′ = 0, so that the left-hand member
vanishes and the equation becomes
0 = Er ′ Pr + Es ′ Ps ,
