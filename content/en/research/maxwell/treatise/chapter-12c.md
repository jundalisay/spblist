If δ and δ ′ , instead of being both apparently zero, had been only observed
to be equal, then, unless we also could assert that E = E ′ , the right-hand
side of the equation might not be zero. In fact, the method would be a mere
modification of that already described.
The merit of the method consists in the fact that the thing observed is the
absence of any deflexion, or in other words, the method is a Null method,
one in which the non-existence of a force is asserted from an observation in
which the force, if it had been different from zero by more than a certain
small amount, would have produced an observable effect.
Null methods are of great value where they can be employed, but they can
only be employed where we can cause two equal and opposite quantities of
the same kind to enter into the experiment together.
In the case before us both δ and δ ′ are quantities too small to be observed,
and therefore any change in the value of E will not affect the accuracy of the
result.

The actual degree of accuracy of this method might be ascertained by tak-
ing a number of observations in each of which A′ is separately adjusted, and
comparing the result of each observation with the mean of the whole series.
But by putting A′ out of adjustment by a known quantity, as, for instance,
by inserting at A or at B an additional resistance equal to a hundredth part
of A or of B, and then observing the resulting deviation of the galvanometer
needle, we can estimate the number of degrees corresponding to an error of 1%.

To find the actual degree of precision we must estimate theMEASUREMENT OF RESISTANCE.

Here δ − δ ′ may be taken to be the smallest observable deflexion of the gal-
vanometer.
If the galvanometer wire be made longer and thinner, retaining the same
total mass, then n will vary as the length of the wire and α as the square

of the length. Hence there will be a minimum value of

If we suppose r, the battery resistance, small compared with A, this gives

or, the resistance of each coil of the galvanometer should be one-third of the

If we allow the current to flow through one only of the coils of the gal-
vanometer, and if the deflexion thereby produced is Δ (supposing the deflex-
ion strictly proportional to the deflecting force), then

In the differential galvanometer two currents are made to produce equal
and opposite effects on the suspended needle. The force with which either
current acts on the needle depends not only on the strength of the current,
but on the position of the windings of the wire with respect to the needle.
Hence, unless the coil is very carefully wound, the ratio of m to n may change
when the position of the needle is changed, and therefore it is necessary to
determine this ratio by proper methods during each course of experiments if
any alteration of the position of the needle is suspected.

The other null method, in which Wheatstone’s Bridge is used, requires only
an ordinary galvanometer, and the observed zero deflexion of the needle is
due, not to the opposing action of two currents, but to the non-existence of
a current in the wire. Hence we have not merely a null deflexion, but a null
current as the phenomenon observed, and no errors can arise from want of
regularity or change of any kind in the coils of the galvanometer. The gal-
vanometer is only required to be sensitive enough to detect the existence and
direction of a current, without in any way determining its value or comparing
its value with that of another current.

221*.] Wheatstone’s Bridge consists essentially of six conductors connect-
ing four points. An electromotive force E is made to act between two of the
points by means of a voltaic battery introduced between B and C. The current
between the other two points O and A is measured by a galvanometer.
Under certain circumstances this current becomes zero. The conductors
BC and OA are then said to be conjugate to each other, which implies a
certain relation between the resistances of the other four conductors, and this
relation is made use of in measuring resistances.208
