103.] As an example of the method of electric images let us calculate the
electric state of two spheres whose radii are a and b respectively, and whose
potentials are Pa and Pb , the distance between their centres being c. We shall
suppose b to be small compared with c.

Fig. 24.TWO SPHERES.

We may consider the actual electrical effects at any point outside the two
spheres as due to a series of electric images.
In the first place, since the potential of the sphere A is Pa we must place
an image at the centre A with a charge aPa .
Similarly at B, the centre of the other sphere, we must place a charge bPb .
Each of these images will have an image of the second order in the other
sphere. The image of B in the sphere a will be at D, where
AD =

The image of A in the sphere b will be at E, where

We might go on with a series of images for ever, but if b is small compared
with c, the images will rapidly become smaller and may be neglected after
the fourth order.TWO SPHERES.

In order that the force may be repulsive it is necessary that the charges of
the spheres should be of the same sign, and

Ea must be greater than Eb

Hence the force is always attractive,
1. When either sphere is uninsulated;
2. When either sphere has no charge;
3. When the spheres are very nearly in contact, if their potentials are
different.
When the potentials of the two spheres are equal the force is always repul-
sive.

105.] To determine the electric force at any point just outside of the surface
of a conducting sphere connected with the earth arising from the presence of
an electrified point A outside the sphere.
The electrical conditions at all points outside the sphere are equivalent, as
we have seen, to those due to the point A together with its image at B. If
e
e is the charge of the point A (Fig. 23), the force due to it at P is

The components in the direction parallel to AC are equal but in opposite
directions. The resultant force is therefore in the direction of the radius, which
confirms what we have already proved, that the sphere is an equipotential
surface to which the resultant force is everywhere normal. The resultant force
ea
is therefore in the direction P C, and is equal to 3 (m2 − 1) in the direction
r
P C, that is to say, towards the centre of the sphere.
From this we may ascertain the surface density of the electrification at any
point of the sphere, for, by Coulomb’s law, if σ is the surface density,
4πσ = R, where R is the resultant force acting outwards.99
DENSITY OF INDUCED CHARGE.
Hence, as the resultant force in this case acts inwards, the surface density
is everywhere negative, and is
σ=−
1 ea 2
(m − 1).
4π r3
Hence the surface density is inversely as the cube of the distance from the
inducing point A.
106.] In the case of the two spheres A and B (Fig. 24), whose radii are
a and b and potentials Pa and Pb , the distance between their centres being
c, we may determine the surface density at any point of the sphere A by
considering it as due to the action of a charge aPa at A, together with that
due to the pairs of points B, D and E, F &c., the successive pairs of images.
Putting
r = P B, r1 = P E, r2 = P G, &c.,
we find

If we call B the inducing body and A the induced body, then we may
consider the electrification induced on A as consisting of two parts, one de-
pending on the potential of B and the other on its own potential.
The part depending on Pb is called by some writers on electricity the in-
duced electrification of the first species. When A is not insulated it constitutes
the whole electrification, and if Pb is positive it is negative over every part
of the surface, but greatest in numerical nature at the point nearest to B.
The part depending on Pa is called the induced electrification of the sec-
ond species. It can only exist when A is insulated, and it is everywhere of
the same sign as Pa . If A is insulated and without charge, then the induced
electrifications of the first and second species must be equal and opposite.
The surface-density is negative on the side next to B and positive on the sideDENSITY OF INDUCED CHARGE.

furthest from B, but though the total quantities of positive and negative elec-
trification are equal, the negative electrification is more concentrated than the
positive, so that the neutral line which separates the positive from the nega-
tive electrification is not the equator of the sphere, but lies nearer to B.
The condition that there shall be both positive and negative electrification
on the sphere is that the value of σ at the points nearest to B and farthest
from B shall have opposite signs. If a and b are small compared with c, we
may neglect all the terms of the coefficients of Pa and Pb after the first. The
b (c − a)
values of r lie between c + a and c − a. Hence, if Pa is between Pb
(c + a)2
b (c + a)
and Pb
, there will be both positive and negative electrification on A,
(c − a)2
divided by a neutral line, but if Pa is beyond these limits, the electrification
of every part of the surface will be of one kind; negative if Pa is below the
lower limit, and positive if it is above the higher limit.
