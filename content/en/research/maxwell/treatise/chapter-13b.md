231*.] The measurement of the electric resistance of electrolytes is rendered difficult on account of the polarization of the electrodes, which causes the observed difference of potentials of the metallic electrodes to be greater than the electromotive force which actually produces the current.

This difficulty can be overcome in various ways. In certain cases we can get rid of polarization by using electrodes of proper material, as, for instance, zinc electrodes in a solution of sulphate of zinc. By making the surface of the electrodes very large compared with the section of the part of the electrolyte whose resistance is to be measured, and by using only currents of short dura- tion in opposite directions alternately, we can make the measurements before any considerable intensity of polarization has been excited by the passage of the current.

Finally, by making two different experiments, in one of which the path of
the current through the electrolyte is much longer than in the other, and so
adjusting the electromotive force that the actual current, and the time during
which it flows, are nearly the same in each case, we can eliminate the effect
of polarization altogether.

232*.] In the experiments of Dr. Paalzow∗ the electrodes were in the form
of large disks placed in separate flat vessels filled with the electrolyte, and the
connexion was made by means of a long siphon filled with the electrolyte and
dipping into both vessels. Two such siphons of different lengths were used.
The observed resistances of the electrolyte in these siphons being R1 and
R2 , the siphons were next filled with mercury, and their resistances when
filled with mercury were found to be R1 ′ and R2 ′ .

The ratio of the resistance of the electrolyte to that of a mass of mercury
at 0°C of the same form was then found from the formula
ρ=
R1 − R 2
.
R1 ′ − R 2 ′
To deduce from the values of ρ the resistance of a centimetre in length
having a section of a square centimetre, we must multiply them by the value
of r for mercury at 0°C. (See Art. 230.)
The results given by Paalzow are as follow:

233*.] MM. F. Kohlrausch and W. A. Nippoldt∗ have determined the resis-
tance of mixtures of sulphuric acid and water. They used alternating magneto-

electric currents, the electromotive force of which varied from 12 to 74
of that
of a Grove’s cell, and by means of a thermoelectric copper-iron pair they re-
1
duced the electromotive force to 429000
that of a Grove’s cell. They found that
Ohm’s law was applicable to this electrolyte throughout the range of these
electromotive forces.
The resistance is a minimum in a mixture containing about one-third of
sulphuric acid.
The resistance of electrolytes diminishes as the temperature increases. The
