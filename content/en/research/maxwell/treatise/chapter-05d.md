Superposition of electric systems.

77.] We have already (Art. 29) given some examples of the superposition
of electric effects, but we must now state the principle of superposition more
definitely.

If the same system is electrified in three different ways, then if the potential
at any point in the third case is the sum of the potentials in the first and second
cases, the electrification of any part of the system in the third case will be the
sum of the electrifications of the same part in the first and second cases.
By reversing the sign of the electrifications and potentials in one of these
cases, we may enunciate the principle with respect to the case in which the
potential and the electrification are at every point the excess of what they are
in the first case over what they are in the second.

78.] We may now establish a theorem which is of the greatest importance
in the theory of electricity.

If the electric field under consideration consist of a finite portion of a di-
electric medium, and if at every point of the boundary of this region the
potential is given, and if the distribution of electrification within the region
be also given, then the potential at any point within the region can have one
and only one value consistent with these conditions.
One value at least of the potential must be possible, because the conditions
of the theorem are physically possible. Again, if at any point two values of the
potential were possible, then by taking the excess of the first value over the
second for every point of the system, a third case might be formed in whichTHOMSON’S THEOREM.

the potential is everywhere the excess of the first case above the second. At
the boundary of the region the potential in the third case is everywhere zero.
Within the region the electrification is everywhere zero. Hence, by (Art. 75),
at every point within the region the potential in the third case is zero.
There is, therefore, no difference between the distribution of potential in
the first case and in the second, or, in other words, the potential at any point
within the region can have only one value.
If in any case we can find a distribution of potential which satisfies the
given conditions, then by this theorem we are assured that this distribution
is the only possible solution of the problem. Hence the importance of this
theorem in the theory of electricity.
79.] For instance, let A be an electrified body and let B be one of the
equipotential surfaces surrounding the body. Let the po-
tential of the surface B be equal to P. Now let a conduct-
ing body be constructed and placed so that its external
surface coincides with the closed surface B, and let it
be so electrified that its potential is P. Then the condi-
tions of the region outside B are the same as when it was
acted on by the body A only. For the potential over the
Fig. 18.
whole bounding surface of the region is P, the same as
before, and whatever electrified bodies exist outside of B remain unchanged.
Hence the potential at every point outside of B may, consistently with the
conditions, be the same as before. By our theorem, therefore, the potential
at every point outside B must be the same, when, instead of the body A, we
have a conducting surface B, raised to the potential P.
80.] The charge of every part of the surface of a conductor is of the same
sign as its potential, unless there is another body in the field whose potential
is of the same sign but numerically greater.
Let us suppose the potential of the body to be positive; then, if on any part
of its surface there is negative electricity, lines of force must terminate on
this part of the surface, and these lines of force must begin at some electrified
surface whose potential is higher than that of the body. Hence, if there is no
other body whose potential is higher than that of the given body, no part of
the surface of the given body can be charged with negative electricity.INDUCED ELECTRIFICATION.
66
If an uninsulated conductor is placed in the same field with a charged con-
ductor, the charge on every part of the surface of the uninsulated conductor
is of the opposite sign to the charge of the charged conductor.
For since the potential of the uninsulated body is zero, there can be no
line of force between it and the walls of the room, or infinite space where the
potential is always zero. The line of force which has one end at any point of
the surface of this body must therefore have its other end at some point of the
charged body, and since the two extremities of a line of force are oppositely
electrified, the electrification of the surface of the uninsulated body must be
everywhere opposite to the charge of the charged body.
The charged body in this experiment is called the Inductor, and the other
body the induced body.
When the induced body is uninsulated, the electricity spread over every
part of its surface is, as we have just proved, of the opposite sign to that of
the inductor.
The total charge, EA , of the induced body, which we may call A, may
be found by multiplying PB , the potential of the inductor B, by QBA , the
mutual coefficient of induction between the bodies, which is always a negative
quantity.
This electrification induced on an uninsulated body is called by some writ-
ers on electricity the Induced Electrification of the First Species. Since the
potential of A is already zero, it is manifest that if any part of its surface
is touched by a fine wire communicating with the ground there will be no
discharge.
Next, let us suppose that the body, A, instead of being uninsulated is insu-
lated, but originally without charge. Under the action of the inductor B part
of its surface, on the side next to B, will become electrified oppositely to B;
but since the algebraic sum of its electrification is zero, some other part of
its surface must be electrified similarly to B.
This electrification, of the same name as that of B, is called by writers
on electricity the Induced Electrification of the Second Species. If a wire
connected with the ground be now made to touch any part of the surface of
A, electricity of the same name as that of B will be discharged, its amount
being equal and opposite to the negative charge (of the first species) whichCOEFFICIENTS OF CAPACITY.

remains on the body A, which is now reduced to potential zero.
In order to obtain a clearer idea of the distribution of electricity on the
surface of A under various conditions, let us begin by supposing the potential
of A to be zero and that of B to be unity. Let the surface-density at a given
point P on the surface of A be −σ1 , and let the whole charge of A be −qAB .
The negative sign is prefixed to the symbols of these quantities because the
quantities themselves are always negative.
The charge of B in this case is qB .
Let us next suppose the potential of A to be unity and that of B to be zero,
and let the surface-density at the point P be now σ2 , and the whole charge
on A, qA .
These quantities are both essentially positive, and qA is called the capacity
of A. The value of both is increased on account of the presence of B in the
field.
Let us now suppose that the potentials of A and B are PA and PB respec-
tively; then the surface-density at the point P is
σ = P A σ2 − P B σ1 ,
and the charge of A is
EA = PA qA − PB qAB ,
and that of B is
EB = PB qB − PA qAB . [See Art. 39.]
If A is insulated and without charge EA = 0, which gives
q
PA = PB AB ,
qA
and the surface-density at P is
P
σ = B (qAB σ2 − qA σ1 ).
qA
On a region of the surface of A next to B, σ will be of the opposite sign
from PB ; and on a region on the other side from B, σ will be of the same sign
with PB . The boundary between these two regions forms what is called theCOEFFICIENTS OF CAPACITY.

neutral line, the form and position of which depend on the form and position
of A and B.
