125.] Now Clausius supposes that it is on the constituent molecules in their
intervals of freedom that the electromotive force acts, deflecting them slightly
from the paths they would otherwise have followed, and causing the positive
constituents to travel, on the whole, more in the positive than in the negative direction, and the negative constituents more in the negative direction than in the positive.

The electromotive force, therefore, does not produce the disruptions and reunions of the molecules, but finding these disruptions and reunions already going on, it influences the motion of the constituents during
their intervals of freedom. The amount of this influence is proportional to the
electromotive force when the temperature is given. The higher the tempera-
ture, however, the greater the molecular agitation, and the more numerous are
the free constituents. Hence the conductivity of electrolytes increases as the
temperature rises.

This effect of temperature is the opposite of that which takes place in met-
als, the resistance of which increases as the temperature rises. This difference
of the effect of temperature is sometimes used as a test whether a conductor is
of the metallic or the electrolytic kind. The best test, however, is the existence
of polarization, for even when the quantity of the free ions is too small to be
observed or measured, their presence may be indicated by the electromotive
force which they excite.

WATER NOT AN ELECTROLYTE.
126.] Kohlrausch∗ finds that if the electromotive force is one volt per cen-
timetre in length of the electrolyte, then if the electrolyte differs but slightly
from pure water at 18°C the velocity of hydrogen is about 0·0029 centimetres
per second, and that the actual force on a gramme of hydrogen in the solution
required to make it move at the rate of one centimetre per second through the
solution is equal to the weight of 330,000,000 kilogrammes.
The velocities of the components of unibasic acids and their salts were
found by Kohlrausch to be in the following proportion:—

127.] The specific molecular conductivity (l) of an electrolyte is the sum
of the velocities of its components† , and the actual conductivity of any weak
solution is found by multiplying the number l by the number of grammes of
the substance in a litre and dividing by the molecular weight of the substance,
that of hydrogen being 1.
128.] We have reason to believe that water is not an electrolyte, and that it
is not a conductor of the electric current. It is exceedingly difficult to obtain
water free from foreign matter. Kohlrausch‡ , however, has obtained water so
pure that its resistance was enormous compared with ordinary distilled water.
When exposed to the air for [4·3 hours its conductivity rose 70 per cent.],
and [in 1060 hours it was increased nearly fortyfold. After long exposure to
the air the conductivity was more than doubled in 4·5 hours by the action of
tobacco smoke.] Water kept in glass vessels very soon dissolves enough of
foreign matter to enable it to conduct freely.

WATER NOT AN ELECTROLYTE.
Kohlrausch∗ has determined the resistance of water containing a very small
percentage of different electrolytes, and he finds that the results agree very
well with the hypothesis that the velocity with which each ion travels through
the liquid is proportional to the electromotive force, the velocity correspond-
ing to unit of electromotive force being different for different ions, but the
same for the same ion, whatever the other ion may be with which it is com-
bined. The velocities of different ions in centimetres per second, correspond-
ing to an electromotive force of one volt, are given in Table II.

When the water contains a large percentage of foreign matter the velocities
of the ions are no longer the same, as it is no longer through water, but
through a liquid of quite different physical properties that they have to make
their way. It appears from Table III† that though for small percentages of
sulphuric acid in water the conducting power is proportional to the percentage
of acid, yet as the proportion of acid increases the conducting power increases
more slowly till a maximum conducting power is reached, after which the
addition of acid diminishes the conducting power‡ .

129.] The oxygen and hydrogen which are given off at the electrodes in so
many experiments on water containing foreign ingredients are, therefore, not
the ions of water separated by strict electrolysis, but secondary products of
the electrolysis of the matter in solution. Thus, if the cation is a metal which
decomposes water, it unites with an equivalent of oxygen and allows the two
equivalents of hydrogen to escape in the form of gas. The anion may be a
[compound radicle] which cannot exist in a separate state, [but which exists
in the nascent condition, and] contains one equivalent [or more] of [some
electronegative element which reacts upon water and liberates oxygen.]
