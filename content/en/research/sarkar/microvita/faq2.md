{{< r a="Question" >}}
Is there any difference of sex in protoplasms, as there is in the case of developed plants and animals?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
In the case of unicellular and multicellular protozoa, the entity is divided by self-dividing processes – by an inner fissiparous tendency. So the question of sex difference does not arise as in the case of animals or plants. 

But there are sex differences in the case of metazoic cells. The human body is the most complex multicellular metazoic structure.

**The male structure has more microvita than the female structure. The sex difference is due to the number of microvita.**

{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
Suppose in the male protoplasm the number of microvita is 10 billion, then in the female protozoa there are 5 billion. Not only the number, but also the varieties of microvita in the male and female structures differ. 

The male body can tolerate the application of positive or negative microvita after the formation of semen starts. 

In a boy above 15 years of age, the formation of semen has started. (In hot countries this usually occurs at 13-15 years and a little later in cold countries.) 

As soon as semen has formed, the number of microvita is also increased in the male body. 

A female body or a male child in whom semen formation has not yet started, cannot tolerate the application of positive or negative microvita. But in the case of the male body, as the testes glands are functioning, the application of microvita will not do any harm.

Yet females or children will also enjoy divine bliss if they satisfy Parama Puruśa. Only by His grace, by the grace of the supreme, can one attain divine bliss by satisfying Him. In anything and everything human might, human power and human brain are extremely limited. Everyone depends on Him.

In the past there was no mass imposition of positive microvita. For the first time the collective application of the positive microvita is being done to elevate the spiritual standard of the general mass.

{{< r a="Question" >}}
What causes an unpleasant odour in the body?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
Due to the accumulation of dead protoplasmic cells, a bad smell arises in the body. The reason for this is not taking a proper bath and washing away the dead cells. 

In certain animals and plants, due to the secretion of smelly hormones, an unpleasant odour is emitted from the body. Everyone should take a bath at regular intervals to clean the body and eat vegetarian food.

{{< r a="Question" >}}
Is micropsychic movement in individual or collective life, animate or inanimate objects, of unilateral or multilateral order?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
Everything in this world, whether animate or inanimate, moves. Everywhere movement is from imperfection towards perfection, but in circum-rotarian style.

Not only microcosms but ectoplasms [lower mind] or microvita also move from imperfection towards perfection in circumferential style. 

Microvita collectively, with the coverage of endoplasm [higher mind], moves in the same style. 

Each and every microvitum moves according to propensive propulsion wrought by the Macrocosm. Impact and tactuality both come from the Macrocosm.

The microcosm is the unit “I” feeling. It cannot move in so many directions, even if it appears to move in many directions.

Movement is always from imperfection to perfection in circumferential style in the unit body.

In the case of the unit “I” or microcosm, the movement is always unilateral in so many directions, not unilineal.

{{< r a="Question" >}}
What is the relationship between the collective body of ectoplasm [lower mind] and microcosm, and the relationship between endoplasm [higher mind] and microcosm? Is there an inter-ectoplasmic gap that links up the unit mind with something external?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
There are so many microcosms and microvita. **Microvita do not have the clear “I” feeling**. Their existence is more of physical nature than of psychic nature.* 

The collective body of microvita is another name of carbon atom. The carbon atom is another name of so many microvita with so many specialities, with so many characteristics. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< n n="This is parallel to Elements of the Physical Domain. Therefore, microvita are the Elements of the Metaphysical Domain, as the Lower Mind of the Supreme, just as souls are the Higher Mind of the Supreme." >}}

{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
<!-- collective body of microvita -->
The living carbon atom, as microvita, is the collective [unclear] “I” feeling maintaining a relationship with the physical body. There is no such relationship in the case of a dead physical structure. 

When such carbon atoms are in cohesion with other carbonic atoms, a [clearer] “I” feeling is created. As coverage of these collective bodies, there is endoplasm [higher mind].

The relationship is inert. In animate and inanimate objects there is:
- intra-atomic gap
- the intra-microvitum gap
- inter-carbonic gap
- and so on

**But these gaps are not a vacuum. They are filled with macropsychic conation.** *

In animate objects there are intra-protoplasmic and inter- protoplasmic gaps. These gaps are also not a vacuun. They are also filled with macropsychic conation.

The microcosm is composed of ectoplasm [lower mind]. **But the movement of ectoplasm [lower mind] is decided by the movement of microvita**.** They move in circum-rotarian style wrought by Macrocosm.
