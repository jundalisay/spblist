Microvitum is a very subtle being. Of the three types of microvita, the crude type are instrumental in emanating life throughout the cosmos. They create a stir within a physical structure. 

In the subsequent stages, through clash and cohesion, enormous changes take place in the physical structure. This process led to the emergence of the dinosaurs, mammals and finally intelligent human beings.

Subtle microvita are those that are too subtle to be detected by a highly developed microscope. These are divided into 2 categories:

1. Those that function within the physical world. 

<!-- world of perception through inferences such as sound, touch, form, taste and smell -->

2. Those that function within the human mind.

 <!-- other category functions directly within the subtler realm – that is, . -->


## Microvita that function within the human mind: 7 Devayoniis

### Negative

1. Yaksa

Yakśas are microvita which cannot be detected by microscopes but can be detected by inferences.

 <!-- are known by their collective form and are called “”.  -->

They are perceived through inferential vibrations. And so, their field of action is the human mind.

**They are instrumental in arousing the propensity to accumulate more and more wealth.** 

This propensity has some spatial and personal necessity. But it is mostly a psychic ailment.

In most cases, this psychic ailment aroused by yakśas is more fatal than the diseases called “yakśmá” (such as tuberculosis or consumption). 

It has:
- produced extremely fissiparous tendencies in human society
- led to the exploitation of one group of human beings by another group who feel elated to hear the lamentations of others.

This psychic ailment:
- is the basis for:
  - the overwhelming urge to acquire wealth
  - the urge for capitalism and the capitalist structure 
- gives rise to the all-consuming and insatiable greed of capitalists.

<!-- The collective name of the microvita which produce this disease in the human mind, in the human psyche, is called “yakśa”.  -->



Yakśas begin their frenetic dance in the mind when a person devoid of any ideology becomes engrossed in the thought of accumulating wealth.

<!-- These yakśas are one of the 7 types of devayonis (the others are gandharva, kinnara, vidyádhara, videhaliina, prakrtiliina and siddha) which are the collective names of different categories of microvita. -->


2. Prakrtiliina

These enemy microvita cause human beings to rush headlong towards the crude pleasures of life. 

These infest human minds which do not:
- keep company with virtuous people
- study elevating books
- saturate themselves with love for the Supreme Entity

Ultimately, the structure of those minds becomes crudified.

<!-- , and through dogma they reach the nadir point of crudification. -->


3. Videhaliina

These  enemy microvita cause the human mind to rush from one place to another, and finally lead it away from Parama Puruśa. 

They keep the human mind oblivious to the supreme purpose of life. 

Due to their inner thirst for material gain, they force the human mind to go around in circles, like bullocks trudging endlessly around an oil mill. 

They make the human mind restless, and by misdirecting it, throw it into utter confusion.





### Positive or Negative

1. Kinnara

The word kinnara means “receptacle of beauty” or “a beautiful and graceful structure”.

These microvita:
- create a thirst for beauty – a strong desire for beautification and decoration. 
- inspire the human mind to make the human body as beautiful as the many forms and figures it observes in the external world. 
 
<!-- This category of microvita creates a tendency in  -->

This propensity is called “kinnari vrtti”. 

These kinnaras are:
- friendly or positive if they lead the mind towards purity and beautification, and then help merge the refined mind in the Supreme Entity
- enemy or negative if they direct the mind towards crude matter

 <!-- instead of leading it towards the subtler layers, they are considered to be negative microvita. -->


2. Vidyádhara

These create a deep urge in the human mind to attain good qualities. 

<!-- Due to their internal urge and inspiration, human beings are able to acquire a lot of accumulated qualities.  -->

These vidyádharas are:
- friendly or positive if they create an urge for performing noble deeds and praising Parama Puruśa
- enemy or negative if they create an for material gain such as name, fame, etc.


<!-- , then these microvita become instrumental in promoting human welfare and may be considered as friend microvita.  -->

### Positive 

1. Gandharva 

These are microvita which arouse love for the fine arts in the human mind. 

They connect the material world with the world of subtle ideation.

They are mostly friendly. 

They inspire people to cultivate the fine arts. They intoxicate the human mind and keep it absorbed in the rhythm and ideation of music and dance so that the thought of the external world gets suspended in the world of subtle ideation.

The fine arts are known as “gandharva vidyá”.

When the human mind is exclusively preoccupied with ideating on music and dance, it means that the mind stuff has been totally captivated by these gandharvas. 

<!-- This category of microvita functioning within the human mind are mostly of a friendly nature.  -->

They convey messages of the subtle world to human ears in this physical world. 

They illuminate the human mind with a flood of divine effulgence by removing the darkness of crude ignorance.


2. Siddha

These positive microvita help in the domain of spirituality. They help spiritual aspirants in various ways:
- They enable the human mind to rise above the physical and psychic strata.
- They guide it to the world of cognition. 

These luminous bodies assist spiritual aspirants in all possible ways.


Those who already have an urge to develop the cognitive faculty are helped by these microvita to increase their urge more and more. 

Those who who have a desire to embrace the life of a renunciate are inspired greatly by these microvita. 

Finally, they develop such an intense desire for that life that they leave their homes. 

Those who crave mystic realizations ultimately become enlightened beings. 

These siddha microvita convey the clarion call of the vast ocean of Supreme Consciousness deep into the minds of ordinary human beings who gaze at their tiny plots of land, and lead them towards the Supreme Entity.


<!-- Those who have come in contact with the siddhas and understand them say that  -->

The so-called Sudharsan Cakra (the cosmic disc of the mythological god Viśńu) is the symbolic name of siddha microvita.


The following are examples of the ceaseless activities of siddha microvita:

- A young man is playing cricket somewhere. In the middle of the game he has a sudden realization which causes a tremendous stir in his mind. He decides to renounce everything and goes out in search of something as yet unknown to him.
- A prince living in luxury suddenly adopts the life of a renunciate and searches for the cause of human misery.
- An 8-10 year old boy suddenly becomes restless for the acquisition of knowledge and decides to leave his family and move towards an unknown and as yet unrealized destination.

These microvita are emanations from the Supreme Entity, not the creation of human beings.
- It is not possible for human beings to release them into the vast cosmos. 

<!-- Supermen cannot create these microvita, what to speak of ordinary human beings.  -->
