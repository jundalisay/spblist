Human longings are expressed through different lateral directions of so many waves, and of so many aspirations, hopes and longings. 

<!-- Hence the subject of today’s discourse is “Four Dimensions of Micropsychic Longing”.  -->

There are many micropsychic longings. 

They are also multifarious in quantity and quality. 

<!-- , not only in number but also in quality and quantity.  -->

These can classed into 4 broad categories.


1. Inherent psycho-physical longing for physical pabulum [food]

This is part of inborn instinct. All living beings are goaded by this primordial nature of longing.
 <!-- that is, psycho-physical longing for physical pabulum.  -->

<!-- It is a natural instinct for each and every object.  -->

<!-- Even in non-living elements, we find  -->

This type of longing is both in animate and inanimate objects.


In each and every physical and psychic structure there, there exists self-controlling faculties that must move with the vital force.

<!-- This inborn instinct is a psycho-physical longing., there are self-controlling faculties also.  -->

<!-- But these faculties cannot move against the   -->
 <!-- the characteristics of -->
When these controlling faculties go against the vital force, disintegration and dissociation start both within and without the framework.

<!-- This is the wont of the individual structure.  -->

In the case of collective structures, regarding these psycho-physical longings, if it is seen that 

A collective living body or expression of a particular nature might not like its current longing. 

In such a case, the controlling faculty creates a change in the physical structure that also changes the nature of the longings.

In an individual structure, the controlling faculty can only goad up to a certain range or stratum. 
- Otherwise, the structure will start disintegration or dissociation both within and without. 

In a collective body, the collective controlling faculty may create a change in the physical structures if such a change is supported by Macrocosmic conation. 
 <!-- otherwise not. -->


2. Imposed psycho-physical longing for physical pabulum [food]

These longings are not inborn. These are created after the development of so many plexi and change in the nature and structure of so many hormones secreted from those newly-created or newly-developed plexi. 

Unlike the previous category, this one:
- is created later on.
<!-- The difference between the first category and the second is that the first one is inborn and the second one is not inborn, it is created later on. -->

<!-- Both the pabula are of physical nature, are physical pabula.  -->
- has the inherent controlling faculty able to move a bit forward

But when this movement goes against the fundamental principles of the physical structure, the structure cannot remain as before -- it starts decomposition from not being able to maintain its integration or structural solidarity. 

In this case, one’s physical structure may be saved only if one ascribes the Macrocosmic grandeur to physical food. 
 <!-- pabulum -->

<!-- There is no other way.  -->

But in the case of the collective structure, there may be change.

That change may not go against the characteristics of the physical structure if there remains a constant endeavour for such a change, rather for such a metamorphosis. 

<!-- This is the second longing, and both the pabula are of physical nature. -->


3. Psychic longing for psychic pabulum. 

This occurs when one wants that one’s psychic emanations should be from crude to subtle and cover all spheres of existence and non-existence. 

In this case an aspirant may move forward till the psychic body maintains a close cooperation or parallelism with the physical waves or the physical existence. But otherwise the mind may get dissociated from the physical structure; for which a psychic diversion, a properly-measured diversion, is necessary or rather indispensable. 

That diversion should always maintain proper equipoise and proper equilibrium with the fundamental principles of pramá [dynamic adjustment], otherwise the physical structure will be lost and at the same time the psychic structure will also be lost. 

Human beings who do not follow the propriety of psychology may undergo, rather may face, such a future. 

In our collective body, as a result of this type of endeavour – constant endeavour – constant longing for all-round expression of micropsychic potentialities will create a sort of balanced world, an earth of pramá, an earth well-balanced by pramá; and it will create, it will assure, a bright future not only for all humanity, but for the entire animate and inanimate world.


4. To encourage apexed psychology or pinnacled psychology. 

Here the mental faculties along with the controlling faculties will move upwards and finally get pointed, and that point is lost in the Supra-Cognitive Entity. 

This is the goal of all living beings. In the course of this endeavour, there comes hardly any obstacle from within, but there may come hindrances and obstacles from without in the shape of ideological clashes. The sources of such clashes are the degrading and degenerating forces working in the realm of the manifested Cosmos. 

In the case of the collective body, if such a practice is encouraged, the entire physical structure of the universe will slowly be metamorphosed into the psychic world and the psychic world will be metamorphosed into spirituality. 

That is, it will help the saiṋcara [extroversial] and pratisaiṋcara [introversial] movement of the Macropsychic conation. It will help the movement of Macropsychic conation, and human beings living on this earth will enjoy the bliss of heaven on this earth of dust. 

You should know this, and you should propagate this supreme psychic future of humanity in a better way, in a nice way.
