{{< r a="Question" >}}
What is the structural formula of microvita?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
Previously, people thought that molecules were the minutest particles of elements. Later it was found that atoms, not molecules, were the minutest entities. Still later it was discovered that even an atom is not the minutest particle, for atoms are made of electrons, protons and many other imaginary and non-imaginary particles.

So, neither atoms nor molecules are the minutest particles of elements because they are composed of many other particles of the expressed world.

People think that a “virus” is the minutest living being. But virus is a vague term. There is in fact nothing like a virus – thus the question of it being a living being does not arise.

Microvitum is the minutest entity. The collection of microvita forms a carbon atom. 

Since a microvitum is the minutest entity, it cannot have a structure like that of an atom or a solar system. **Since a microvitum is a singular entity, it has no structure. By nature it is more energy than matter.**

And so, it travels and moves through inferences [Spatial and Aethreal Layer], whereas other entities cannot move through inferences.

{{< r a="Question" >}}
What is the difference between positive and negative microvitum?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
Positive microvitum is pro-ectoplasmic [pro-lower-mind] – it is more ectoplasmic than matter. 

Negative microvitum is pro-materialistic – it is more matter than mind, than ectoplasm [lower-mind]. 

Since it is more of ectoplasmic nature, a positive microvitum starts functioning or working first in the mental level. It then filters down towards physical matter. 

Negative microvitum starts functioning in matter and moves towards the mind, towards ectoplasmic [lower mind] stuff and endoplasmic [higher mind] coverage.

{{< r a="Question" >}}
What are the possible physiological effects of the application of positive or negative microvita? How and why do they take place?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
If a lot of positive or negative microvita enter a person, there may be instantaneous or gradual death. 

If the body is not properly developed, as in the case of boys below 16 years of age, or in the case of women whose minds are very sentimental, the application of positive or negative microvita may bring about instantaneous death.

**To receive positive microvita, the body should not be carnivorous. It must be vegetarian.** 

Non-vegetarians are not fit to receive the application of positive microvita. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
Positive or negative microvita can affect the protoplasmic cells of a structure directly, and even bring about a change in the genetic structure. 

**Even the sex of a person can change due to the application of positive or negative microvita.**

The glands and sub-glands also are directly affected by negative or positive microvita, which in this way influence the hormone secretions as well as the nerve cells or nerve fibres. 

**One may gain or lose memory or gain or lose strength as a result of positive or negative microvita.**

{{< r a="Question" >}}
What are the possible psychological effects of the application of positive or negative microvita, and how and why do they take place?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
Microvita creates psychological impact due to their influence on the plexii where all the 3 types of vrttis (propensities of the mind) are affected:
- pro-physical propensities
- psychic propensities
- pro-spiritual propensities.

All the 50 vrttis are affected by positive or negative microvita. 

The positive microvita are pro-ectoplasmic [lower mind] and can move both towards the subtler existence of the human spirit and also towards the cruder manifestations of human existence. But negative microvita, being pro-matter, can move only downwards.

Negative microvita can function directly at the physico-psychic plexus (at the Vishuddha Cakra) but they cannot move upwards to the occult plexus (at the Guru Cakra). 
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
Only with the application of force by a powerful personality, can postive microvita be raised to the lunar plexus (at the Ájiṋa Cakra). 

<!-- physico-psychic plexus -->
This raising of negative microvita above the throat chakra is called “rusti” or “risti”. 

The application of negative microvita on the human mind deranges the mind and causes many psychic ailments such as eccentricity, schizophrenia, mania, melancholia, etc. 

In the case of positive microvita, the reaction takes place after they cross the lunar plexus, both in female and male bodies. 

Only positive microvita can touch the lunar plexus and be elevated up to the occult plexus. 

They start their journey in the lunar plexus. As they move upwards, they increase their speed and bring about acceleration in spiritual progress, both in males and females.

Positive microvita may also be used for intellectual development and for imparting certain occult powers.
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
**The lunar plexus is the highest point of positive microvita.** But if they are raised upwards to the occult plexus, this is called “krpá” (grace).

Raising positive microvita from the lunar plexus to the pinnacled point of human glory is called “karuńá”. 

Without grace, there cannot be karuńá. There cannot be any galloping jump. You should always try to avoid rusti, the raising of negative microvita, and always try to receive the glamour of grace or of karuńá.

{{< r a="Question" >}}
What will happen to microvita at the boiling and freezing temperatures? Will they die?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
No, they will undergo:
- contraction and hibernation at freezing temperature
- expansion and hibernation at boiling temperature. 

**Negative microvita will die a natural death after their natural life span.** 

In order to kill negative microvita before the end of their life span, the number of positive microvita has to be increased by good thinking and sádhaná (spiritual practice).

**Only by increasing the number of positive microvita is the unnatural death of negative microvita possible.**
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
If under extreme temperatures microvita died, then some of the diseases now prevalent would have ceased to exist, but this has not happened.

Rather, diseases have become more complicated. Malaria has become malignant malaria. 

During the WWI, the decaying bodies of dead soldiers attracted negative microvita from other stars and thus the influenza disease originated. 

Even now, influenza is fatal to human beings in cold countries. **Influenza has a natural duration of 4 days whether medicine is taken or not.**
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
When negative microvita devour the positive microvita of a diseased person, then that person dies. 

Medicines only reduce the pain caused by disease in different parts of the body. It is not proper to say that medicine cures a disease. 

**The disease can be cured only when the numbers of positive microvita are increased, and they devour the negative microvita.**

**There are certain persons who can cure diseases merely by touch -- this is the application of positive microvita.**

<!-- . The science behind this is also the  And -->

The cause of the decomposition of anything over time is negative microvita.

When a person is attacked by negative microvita and certain symptoms are observed, it is called “prognosis”.

When the symptoms develop in the final stage of the disease, it is called “diagnosis”.
