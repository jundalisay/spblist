Until now, scientists think that no structure can come into being without carbonic fundaments. That is, the survival, multiplication and decaying of any structure is not possible without carbonic locus standii. 

**Carbons and non-carbons both get their atomic structure from microvita.** 

A carbonic framework requires space both in theory and practice.

But since microvitum is not of carbonic origin, it only requires space in theory, but not in the realm of physicality. 



## The Structure of a Carbon Atom

An atom has a nucleus around which electrons revolve. The weight of an atom is decided by the mass of its nucleus. 

**The difference between two atoms is mainly one of nuclear difference.** 

**In this respect, the mass of the satellites is of little importance.** 

If the nucleus of an atom is split up, tremendous energy or calories will surely be released.

Every protozoic structure is based on carbon atoms.

A single microvitum is insufficient to form one carbon atom. 
- But when billions of microvita get solidified, a carbon atom is formed – generally or naturally of heterogeneous nature.

Under special circumstances of homogeneous nature, the singularity or plurality of atoms constitutes one molecule.

Many molecules acquire the status of an element whether:
- homogeneous, such as hydrogen, carbon, helium, etc.
- heterogeneous, such as hydrogen monoxide, hydrogen peroxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, etc. 

An atom may be:
- internally of both homogeneous and heterogeneous character 
- externally of both homogeneous and heterogeneous character. 

Similar is the case with a molecule. 

**But a molecule is internally more heterogeneous and externally more homogeneous.** 

So, an atom stands with its unitary glamour according to its:
- internal homogeneity or
- internal heterogeneity.

Hydrogen, sulphur and oxygen collectively form sulphuric acid under:
- certain temperatures 
- particular barometric conditions
- specified proportions. 

**If one of these conditional factors varies, the result will also vary.**

**When there is no carbon atoms, protoplasmic structures cannot be formed.** 

Protoplasmic cells are molecular ones of heterogeneous nature. 

**If the nuclei of protoplasmic cells are split up, they release innumerable times more energy than a nuclear explosion does.**

Living bodies are composed of countless protoplasmic cells. They possess huge proportions of energy – something which is beyond ordinary comprehension.

Billions of microvita produce a single carbon atom. That is why it cannot be said that everything comes from carbon atoms. Rather, the carbon atoms come from microvita. 


All other kinds of atoms, not only carbon ones, are the creation of microvita. 

Naturally, chemistry, biochemistry and all other associated branches of science will undergo a revolutionary change. 

In the future, an omega of mathematics will coincide with an omega of biochemistry. 

All formulae and theories followed up till now will have to be reformulated, redefined and reclassified.
