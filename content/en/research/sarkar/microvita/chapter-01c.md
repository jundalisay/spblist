{{< n n="This is from the Bengali version of Shabda Cayaniká which really is just a collection of words and their explanations. This chapter shows how microvita are similar to unicellular creatures (krimi) but are not actually germs. We have totally overhauled this chapter to emphasize microvita instead of confusing them with germs." >}}


<!-- ## Krimi

Krimi do not always remain in the same form. 

The form they have at the time of their birth undergoes a radical change. 

The changes in their forms and sizes take place stage by stage. These stages of metamorphosis are not the same in all cases. 

As unicellular creatures, they divide their nuclei and multiply into two or more forms. They have no sex difference and thus there is no distinction between ovum and spermatozoa. 

These are the creatures of the primordial stage of creation in this expressed world. But all the creatures of this group are not of the same type – some are born from eggs, subsequently taking the form of larvae which undergo external metamorphosis, and acquire their final form as flying creatures. As they have an orderly growth divided into subsequent stages, they are called “krimi” in Saḿskrta. -->


**Microvita do not belong to the category of unicellular creatures.**

- Like all other organic and psychic beings, microvita exist, multiply and die. 
- Unlike them, microvita are not directly related to carbon atoms or carbon molecules. Microvita are not subjected to barometric conditions or temperature. 

Unicellular creatures grow and decay within the scope of the 5 fundamental factors
- But cruder microvita function within the realm of the five inferences*.


{{< n n="*These mean the mental or metaphysical body instead of the physicality of the 5 Factors (which become 5 Inferences in the mental realm). For this, we use the word 5 Strata" >}}





<!-- Due to adverse temperatures and barometric conditions, no creatures can go to other planets under normal conditions.  -->

Unicellular creatures can live in stones or any other solid matter as they travel to other planets. But they normally remain in water and other subtle fundamental factors*. 

{{< n n="This can only be the convertible or gas-material layers" >}}


This is why humans must ensure that their water and air remain pure. 

The use of pesticides and germicides may be increased. But if the noumenal cause for disease is not found then the pollution will worsen.

Microvita only have an indirect relationship to pollution. 

Circular microvita may function within the scope of the crude mind stuff (kámamaya kosa). Their collective good thoughts can check the flow of negative microvita.

For this, mental and physical development are indispensable in collective life.

Intellectually and spiritually advanced people, through their thoughts, can destroy or resist the movement of enemy microvita. 

But if sinful people continue to create newer and newer microvita in their psychic sphere*, there will always remain the possibility of the creation of subtler forms of negative microvita. 


{{< n n="*Therefore, microvita are born and die in the mind as toughts." >}}

 


These microvita can cause immense harm in the collective sphere of different planets and the entire cosmos.(2) 

But not all microvita are the enemies of human beings:
- some are harmful
- some are friendly
- some are neutral

<!-- Similarly, some krimi [germs] are inimical, some are friendly and some are neutral. -->

<!-- ## Krimishatru/krimiripu

The meaning of the term is “ghoŕanim” or “mahánimba” [“margosa”]. In the world there are different varieties of margosa. Some are very bitter, some less bitter and some are not bitter at all (such as curry leaves). 

In certain regions of India where cassiander leaves do not grow, people use curry leaves instead of cassiander leaves. The variety of margosa mainly found in India is margosa indica. 

This variety of margosa is used as a bitter food or bitter medicine. In the spring, margosa leaves are a highly beneficial medicine. They serve as an antidote to skin diseases, remove poison from the blood and function as blood purifiers.

*Vasante bhramańam pathyam Athavá tiktabhojanam*

[A morning walk in spring and eating bitter food is like a convalescent therapy.]

As a medicine, margosa indica has both external and internal applications. The juice of margosa leaves may be used as a poultice or bandage on an affected part of the body. 

Margosa oil, margosa ghee and margosa juice are extremely good medicines for skin disease. The oil extracted from margosa seeds is also a very good medicine. 

The margosa fruit is also used as food by birds and poor people. The most bitter variety of margosa available in India is called “ghoranim” in Bengali, “bakayan” in Urdu and “mahánimba” in Saḿskrta. The margosa tree is quite large, the leaves are pointed and the fruits are round. 

The medicinal value of the most bitter variety is immense, but it should not be used as a food because it is extremely bitter. 

If margosa is used excessively or taken continuously for many days, it may cause blood dysentery. Just as pigeons and sparrows are attacked with blood dysentery after eating wheat grains continuously for several days, mahánimba also causes blood dysentery in human beings. -->

The air of the margosa tree:
- destroys the harmful effects of bacteria
- can fight against negative microvita

This is why margosa is also recognized as one of the five sacred trees (paiṋcavati). 

In the olden days, people liked to perform spiritual practices sitting in an environment free from the pernicious effects of disease and germs.

That is why they would plant paiṋcavati in and around the place of meditation or spiritual practice:

1. Nimbá (margosa)
2. Bilva (wood apple)
3. Shalmali (silk cotton tree)
4. Bat (banyan indica)
5. Ashvatha (Indian fig tree)

Some people of course use ámlakii (wood sorrel) as a substitute plant. In paiṋcavati, mahánimba may be planted instead of ordinary margosa.



If a plant, such as a banana, is diseased by an epidemic, 2-3 feet of the diseased part should be cut off and burnt to ashes some distance away. 

The ashes should be buried under the earth. The diseased parts should not be burnt in the same place where the epidemic first broke out. 

This is because the epidemic might have been caused by a variety of microvita which are not easily destroyed by the normal heat of fire.


<!-- ## Krimisamkosa

Krimi + sam – koshá = krimisamkosa. 

One can spell this word with either “sha” or “sa”. Krimisamkosa means “a kind of epidemic which causes large scale destruction to plants and trees”, or it may also mean “the type of bacteria that causes the epidemic”. 

Epidemic plant diseases are the worst enemies of plants and trees. Once an epidemic breaks out, farmers become extremely helpless and frustrated because there are very few medicines which can completely or successfully eliminate it. Banana plants, potatoes and egg plants are affected most by epidemic diseases. 

Effective, high quality medicines may be used in such an epidemic, but in the absence of such medicines, 2-3 feet of the diseased part of the plant should be cut off and burnt to ashes some distance away.

The ashes should be buried under the earth. 

The diseased parts should not be burnt in the same place where the epidemic first broke out. 

The epidemic might have been caused by a variety of microvita which are not easily destroyed by the normal heat of fire.

In an area or tree prone to disease, insecticide should be used once before and once after the flowering of the plant. This will greatly reduce the possibility of an epidemic attacking the plants.

<!-- ## Khara

From some living entities – whether living creatures, plants, fruits, flowers, leaves or roots or anything else – a kind of musty odour is emitted. 

This kind of smell is also emitted from unclean bodies or the bodies of those people who do not bathe regularly. Those who consume a lot of static food also emit this sort of foul smell.

Those who have excessively mean propensities also develop this kind of repulsive odour due to the defects in their hormones. 

In fact, smell particles are formed out of the hormones secreted from the various glands. Similarly, an intensely foul smell is emitted from the bodies of tigers because they are carnivorous. 

Although cats belong to the tiger family, they are partly vegetarian, so there is less foul smell in their bodies. The foul smell particles of some plants work as medicine in other bodies. 

The indigenous American Indians did not like to eat tomatoes because of their foul smell, although they fed them to their domestic animals. They would only eat tomatoes when they were sick. 

If the foul smell can be removed from tomatoes through scientific culture, a major change in the qualities of the vitamins may take place. 

Soybeans also have an unpleasant smell. This is why they are not very popular in India. 

If the repulsive smell of soybeans is removed, then a major change in their qualities will take place.

If you happen to pass an abattoir or some temples, you will invariably experience a kind of repulsive smell which is not exactly a stinking smell. The testes of a billy-goat produce a kind of foul smell that spreads throughout its body. Consequently, it is extremely difficult to go close to an adult billy-goat. 

A hilsa fish (an Indian herring) is extremely fond of flesh – rotten flesh is its favourite food – hence it produces a kind of repulsive secretion. 

If a fish bowl or container which held hilsa fish is cleaned with a cloth, and the cloth is used to clean another container, a repulsive smell will be emitted from the second container unless it is properly ventilated. 

A vegetarian will feel uncomfortable if this container is used for eating, drinking or anything else. Strict vegetarians avoid using any container which has been used to hold non-vegetarian food. 

This perhaps explains why hilsas, sharks and crocodiles emit almost the same type of foul smell.

Another meaning of the word “khara” is “a rotten smell or a stinking smell”. One will experience this kind of smell if one walks by a place where animal corpses are dumped.   -->


When a dead body is left exposed for more than 24 hours, germs which decompose the body set in. **These so-called germs are in fact negative microvita.** 

The slightest contact with these negative microvita is extremely pernicious for most creatures. 

However, some creatures have a physical structure that contains more powerful negative microvita.
- Rotten flesh is not as harmful to them. 

 <!-- as is it for other creatures. -->


### Positive Microvita Can Decompose Into Negative 

Milk is turned into curd through microvita. 

For about 48 hours, these microvita remain in positive form. But if curd remains exposed to heat for more than 48 hours, the positive microvita decompose and change into negative microvita. 

This is why curd can be eaten up to 48 hours after it has become ready for consumption. 

Later, when the curd emits a rancid smell, it is unfit for human consumption because it is infested with negative microvita. 

**As long as there are positive microvita in curd, it is more useful and nutritious than milk.**

<!-- One may die if one eats the rotten flesh of a cow, goat or fish. A human being may be attacked with cholera, but a crow, jackal or vulture will not be harmed if it consumes rotten flesh. This is because of physical constitution. 

Some non-vegetarians can even digest stinking food such as cooked dried meat, died fish, etc., but strict vegetarians will definitely become sick if they eat such food. -->
