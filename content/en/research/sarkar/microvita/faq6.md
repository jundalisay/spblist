{{< r a="Question" >}}
What is the biological reaction of microvita on the physical body? What biological changes take place if microvita are added to protoplasmic cells?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
In the case of positive microvitum, if it enters the body suddenly, death may take place, particularly in the case of boys below 16.

 <!-- the case of those bodies which are not properly developed, say  lunar plexus -->

In the case of women where the mind is very sentimental, death may take place even in the case of positive microvita. 

In the case of positive microvita, good reactions take place after they move above the ajna chakra. Positive microvita increase their speed above that chakra. 

Spiritual advancement is accelerated after crossing the ajna chakra, both in male and female bodies. 

The recipient should be vegetarian, not carnivorous. Those who follow a non- vegetarian diet are not fit for the application of positive microvita. 

When I microvite someone I usually ask, “When did you last take fish and meat?”

Microvita may affect the glands and sub-glands or the nuclei of the nerve cells, and even the transformation of species and the transformation of sex may occur. 

Microvita may directly affect the plexii, and through the plexii the mental propensities or vrttis are affected. 

Vrttis or propensities are of 3 types:

1. Pro-physical
2. Psychic propensities
3. Pro-spiritual

All these 3 types of vrttis are affected. A person may become eccentric or experience a reaction of schizophrenia, mania or melancholia, or one may experience both psychic and physical disease.

{{< r a="Question" >}}
What is the silver lining between the quinquelemental universe and idea – that is, between the initial stage of matter and microvita?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
**Microvita are the initial stage of matter. Microvita are a very, very subtle kind of matter.**

All of a sudden microvita are transmuted into matter and matter is transmuted into microvita. 

For investigating the initial stage of matter, research is not possible in physical laboratories. 

But it is possible in the human mind and human soul. 

**Microvitum is closer to the realm of ideas than matter.**


<!-- Then, what is the silver line of demarcation between matter and idea?  -->

The silver lining that demarcates matter and idea. 
- The outside is matter
- The inner side is idea. 

**This silver lining is made of the initial stage of matter and the cruder stage of idea.** 

- The atom is the constituent of matter just as idea is the constituent of microvita.
- Matter stays close to microvita just as microvita stays close to idea.

That is the line of demarcation. 

If you powder down atoms then you get microvita. If microvita could be powdered down, you would get idea.

Atoms are not perceived by the naked eye, but only by experimental results, similar is the case with microvita. 

Atomic research can be done in physical laboratories. But microvita research can only be done in the human mind and soul.

Microvita are the silver lining between idea and matter, though they are closer to the realm of ideas than matter.

{{< r a="Question" >}}
What is the difference between the effect of microvita on developed creatures and their effect on undeveloped creatures?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
Microvita make no difference or find no difference amongst different living beings. 

Complex living beings have glands and sub-glands which secrete different types of hormones. 

Microvita develop, invigorate, increase or decrease the hormone secretions of these glands and sub-glands.

Therefore, developed beings – physically and psychologically complex beings – have greater scope to progress through the aid of microvita than undeveloped creatures. 

<!-- This is the difference between the effect of microvita on developed creatures and the effect on undeveloped creatures. Let us take an example.  -->

On a moonlit night, light is showered equally on one and all. But not everyone can utilize that light properly. 

The moon cannot be blamed for this. 

Similarly, microvita emanating from the cosmic factor are for one and all.

## Section H


{{< r a="Question" >}}
What is the relationship amongst waves, sub-waves and microvita?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Sarkar" >}}
Microvita pervade both the ectoplasmic [lower mind] and endoplasmic [higher mind] worlds. 

Their presence creates various wavelengths. Waves are created when microvita move through the media of inferences. 

**Inferences are the major waves, but sub-waves are created in them by moving microvita.** 

The major waves function as the controlling waves for the sub-waves. 

When there is a change in the wavelength of a controlling wave, the entire inference, with all its qualities, gets transmuted. 

However, if there is a change in the wavelengths of the sub-waves only, the qualities contained in the major wave – that is, in the inference – change.

For example, solid objects contain all the fundamental factors. Hence, they carry the five inferences of smell, taste, form, touch and sound.

If the microvita moving through the particular smell inference of a solid object are changed without effecting the major wavelength, the solid would not be changed. 

This is because there would be no change in the major wavelength, although there was a qualitative change in all of its five attributes.

But if the major wavelength – that is, the inferential wave – of the solid object undergoes a change, all the inferences will be transmuted accordingly.*
