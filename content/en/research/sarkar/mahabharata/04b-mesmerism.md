It is improper to think that everything in India has come from abroad. 

Bhaskaracarya first discovered:
- that the earth was round, not Copernicus
- that the earth is moving, not by Galileo
- the law of gravitation, not by Newton.

<!-- We give incorrect training to children. -->

Homoeopathy sprang up in India itself. Nor did surgery originate with Aryans, but in India.

If a mind of a person is stronger than the other person, it will control the other mind.
- The controlled mind will follow the stronger mind. 

The stronger mind imposes itself on the other mind either directly or by some artificial means indirectly.

Because of the effect of the stronger mind, the controller mind utilizes its mental power against the disease and gets free from it.

This sort of treatment by hypnotic spell, people say, was started by Dr. Mesmer of France, and so this system is known as “mesmerism.” 

But prior to Dr. Mesmer, this system was known to Indians as “rákśasii vidyá.” 

In ancient India (by ancient India I mean the non-Aryans, the natives of India) there was a non-Aryan lady doctor, Kárkatii Rákśasii. 

This Rákśasii was very famous for her mesmeric treatment. This sort of treatment should therefore not have been known as “mesmerism” – it should have been known as something different.

Hence we find that in the Mahábhárata age, there was surgery, ayurveda, vaedyaka shástra, viśa cikitsá, and homoeopathy.

People also knew the mesmeric treatment.

This proves that medical science was not underdeveloped.

If medical science was developed so much, why was it destroyed?


In the early Buddhistic age the following were not considered lowly:
- touching the dead body
- learning the structure of the dead skeleton, etc

But after Buddha, people began to take it as lowly.

Touching the dead body was considered to be most undesirable.

This affected medical science a lot.

Surgery especially was much affected, and because of this all medical science was affected.

600-700 years after Buddha, Buddhists once again discussed medical science a lot and tried their best to develop it.

<!-- But immediately after Buddha it was completely discouraged, and medical science in India had its downfall. Moreover,  -->

When people did start to develop medical science some time after Buddha, there was simultaneously an invasion from outside India.

This invasion discouraged ayurveda, vaedyaka shástra, viśa cikitsá and surgery in India.  And so the unani (hakimii) System of medicine began to take root.

Because the hakimii system was not much cultivated in this country, the downfall of India as far as medical science is concerned, occurred.
