The small states in Bháratavarśa were always at war with one another because they were selfish.

Each state wanted to expand and consume others.

Amga Desha (now the Bhagalpur area) adjoined Magadha, and across the Ganges was Vaeshalii.

Towards the western side of the River Sone was Kashii Rajya. All these were fighting among themselves. 

In between Magadha and Amga there was a patch of fertile land yielding a rich crop of wheat, oil seeds, pulses, etc. 

Since this patch of land was mostly under water in rainy season, which made the land fertile, it was named Amba Bhumii (the Land under Water). Because of Amba Bhumii there was a constant severe clash among Amga, Magadha and Vaeshalii or Videha. 

Naturally Amba Bhumii was captured sometimes by Amga, sometimes by Magadha and sometimes by Videha. (You know the persons belonging to Amba Bhumii are known as Ambastha).

In the then society there was no collective spirit, no solid social structure. 

The people were strictly following the systems of art, music, dance, architecture and literature given by Lord Shiva.

All respected the ideology given by Lord Shiva, but since the collective spirit was not there, there were Mongolians, Dravidians, Negroids and Austrics living separately. 

Dharma in the socio-economico-political field could not enter in and hence a solid collective structure could not be made. 

During the period of the Mahábhárata, Lord Krśńa realized the necessity of synthesizing all the different states into one and naming it Great India, because He realized that India was scattered into fragments due to the lack of only one thing, i.e. collective spirit.

The then India began to have the sense of becoming one as for instance, the Pandavas were Austrico-Aryan and Aryo-Austric. 

These people were then living in the West Uttar Pradesh area, the present western portion of UP and eastern portion of the Punjab – the present Haryana-Meerut area.

They were the first indigenous Indian population – the present Jat people.

The Pandavas and Kaoravas were Jats. 

The effort to synthesize all the states had also then started.

For instance, Bhima was wedded to Hidimba, a Mongolian girl from East India.

Krśńa was married to Rukmini, a girl from the North Eastern Frontier Area (which is now splintered into a number of states).

The wife of Arjuna was Citramgada, a Mongolian girl from Manipur. Hence we see an effort to make a common Indian race; i.e., the Mahábhárata could be made possible in that way.

The people accepted the supremacy of Lord Shiva, there were different rituals, and dharma sádhaná in the true sense of the term was not there.

That does not mean that there was no dhármika sádhaná. There were even great rśis and munis.

Jarasandha, a king of that time, was performing the sádhaná of avidyá tantra. 

Jayadratha, a personality in the Mahábhárata, was a Shaeva Tántrika.

Some were Kaolas and some Vaeśńavas – not Vaeśńavas like the present, but they had the mentality of Vaeśńavas, as for instance Maharsi Garga.

There was some influence of rituals on the then kings and the people at large.

As for instance Kamsa, the king of Shurasena and maternal uncle of Krśńa, was a rigid Shakta, an oppressive king. 

Due to this, Maharsi Garga had to hatch a conspiracy which resulted in the victory of Krśńa.

Kamsa had banned the entry of Garga into the Shurasena kingdom.

There was an order from higher authority to female and male spies (visa kanya and Gaha puruśa) to arrange for delicious dishes for Maharsi Garga and to poison them.

This was to be done with the intention of avoiding the unpopularity of the king that would result from the arrest of Maharsi Garga. By respecting Maharsi Garga, on the other hand, by arranging for dainty dishes, the king’s popularity would only be enhanced.

The system of 4 varńas was simply nominal at the time of the Mahábhárata, as it was in the Vaedika age.

The system of varńas was only due to war purposes in the Vaedika period.

In the Mahábhárata age this system got somewhat strengthened. 

The worldly father of Lord Krśńa was Vasudeva, a popular ksatriya leader, an army commander.

But Lord Krśńa’s guardians, Nanda and Upananda, the cousins of Vasudeva, were known as gopa yadava (milkmen). 

Nanda was a gopa (vaeshya). His uncle, Maharsi Garga, was a vipra, because he adopted a life of scriptural study, contemplation and meditation.

There was no rigidity in the caste system. Some time later the rigidity came into being.

The leader of the Mahábhárata was neither the Pandavas nor the Kaoravas, but Lord Krśńa Himself, both directly and indirectly. 

It was all foreseen by Maharsi Garga. He named the child Krśńa: “Krśńa náma rákhen Garga dhyánete jániyá” – in dhyána he realized that Puruśottama was to take birth, and he thought it proper to name the child Krśńa.
