Kansa was a most wicked king. Wicked-minded people always unite to save their position.

The reign of Kansa had one speciality: the profusion of male and female spies. 

In each and every village he had his spies.

The women spies were then known as “viśa kanyá” and the male spies as “gaha puruśa.”

Maharshi Garga was the greatest mahátmá and realized soul (pańd́ita) of that time. 
- He was doing penance for the advent of Mahásambhúti.

To save the world from the evil forces (pápashakti), he properly utilized the physical and mental capacity bestowed on him by the Lord.
<!-- , virtuous (dhármika) and wonderful Personality of his time,   -->

<!-- A wise man, while praying for the advent of Mahásambhúti from within, also   -->

If the power given by the Lord in the physical body and mental body is not utilized, the Lord will not give spiritual power even if asked. 

Only those who utilize their physical and mental power have the right to ask spiritual power from the Lord.

If a wicked man is fighting against you. You should fight vigorously against him.

[[You will earn the right to ask Iishvara for more power only when you have completely exhausted the power that He had already given you.]] 

If you don’t fight, like a coward, and ask for more power, the Lord will not give you any.

This sort of cowardliness entered into the Indians of that time and still does today.

Suppose the enemy attacks and you begin squatting in groups and start Rámdhuna (repeating the name of Rama).

This sort of approach will not do at all.

Pick up your weapons, go and fight and say to yourselves “Victory to the Lord” – this alone is the practical approach.

Garga Muni had just this practical sense. He was praying to the Lord and also utilizing his energy and wisdom.

He also had his own group to fight against vices (Pápa).

Everything about the activities of Kansa was crystal-clear to him. 

Kansa wanted to kill him. But he was not able to kill a famous maharśi like Garga as people might go against him.

Garga Muni was the brother of Vasudeva, i.e., he was uncle to Lord Krśńa.

When Krśńa was born, Maharshi Garga knew in his meditation that the work would be done now, and hence he named the child Krśńa.

<!-- It was he who named the child Krśńa – Krśńa has so many names but the name Krśńa was given by Garga himself.  -->

With the help of Garga, Krśńa killed Kansa.

If Krśńa had not killed Kansa, it would not have been possible for Him to mend the world and form Great India.

<!-- for Him to materialize His future programme of  -->

<!-- Here is one more example of Lord Krśńa’s practical approach, though there are so many like it.  -->

The Kuru kingdom was not then the biggest kingdom in India, nor was the Panchala kingdom.

These kingdoms formed the present Haryana area, the area around Delhi.

The biggest kingdom was Magadha. 

The people of Magadha were against the Kuru and Panchala kingdoms, and even against the Vedas. 

“Maga” means a person who does not accept the Vedas.

All the priests who did not accept the Vedas were known as “maga” And the “dhá” root plus “d́a” makes “dha,” which means “believers”; i.e., the land of the people who accept maga is known as Magadha.

The people of Magadha were opposed to the Aryan code of conduct.

The King of Magadha then was Jarasandha. 

His child was born in pieces and was joined by a lady doctor, a rákśasii (aboriginal), by operating and stitching the body of the child. 

Hence he was known as Jarasandha, as the joining (sandhi) was done by Jara.

Krśńa and Jarasandha were cousins but they were enemies.

Jarasandha was against dharmarájya (the rule of the righteous). 

Lord Krśńa had a scheme to make a great India, to join all the scattered kingdoms into one.

But Jarasandha wanted his own kingdom.

Lord Krśńa became the king of the Shurasena [[kingdom]] after He killed Kansa.
