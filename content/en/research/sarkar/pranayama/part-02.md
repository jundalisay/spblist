Here are the rules before teaching Sakumbhaka Pranayama:

1. Sahaja Pranayama is extremely beneficial for those who have low blood pressure

**But it is extremely harmful for those who have high blood pressure.** 

Before prescribing this Pranayama, therefore, blood pressure should be confirmed.


2. If one experiences headache, one should not practise Pranayama during Sadhana. 

Insterad, do other lessons. When there is no more headache, one can do Pranayama.


3. In Sakumbhaka Pranayama, counting must be kept in view very strictly, because the span of time must not vary. 

Prescribed number in Puraka, Kumbhaka and Recaka should be counted not with the help of numerals but with the help of Ista Mantra brought within the scope of Sargam.


4. The inner portion of body gets dry by this Pranayama, so the Sadhaka should take fatty materials like milk products, etc.


5. After being established in Kevalii Kumbhaka and developing an absolute devotion for the goal, one should be prescribed this Sakumbhaka Pranayama. 

This is because flickering of mind towards unwanted directions will harm the Sa'dhaka.


6. Practice of Sakumbhaka Pranayama makes the belly pot‑like. 

If the Sadhaka has to check it, he should practise Purakanta Asanas e.g. Pashcimotta'na'sana. 

Where does Pranayama affect directly? It affects the whole area in which Prana Vayu is active. 

Prana Vayu resides from Vishuddha to navel point, from navel to anus functions Apana. 

In the navel resides Samana Vayu, which maintains a balance between Prana and Apana. 

When you inhale, there is pressure on the Samana Vayu from above by Prana Vayu, and from below by Apana Vayu, (as depicted in the picture) and vice versa is the case when you exhale.

As a consequence, when you practise Pranayama, all the 3 Vayus are affected.

Consequently, all the glands, plexii and sub‑glands lying in their scope or in their path, are affected.

These glands and sub‑glands control different propensities. 
- It means that they are directly connected with the mind. 

The relation of these glands with the mind is also accomplished through pituitary and pineal glands. 

These two uppermost glands have direct relationship with the lower Cakras. 

The higher Cakras influence the lower ones and are themselves seats of mind and Atma respectively.

Thus the glands, sub‑glands and plexii are strongly associated with the mind, as such when the glands are affected by Pranayama, mind is automatically affected. 

Normally, the mind influences the glands and sub‑glands, so much so that **the hormone secretes in accordance with the mental thought.** 

But in Pranayama the opposite is the case. 

The mind is influenced by the activation of the glands, it is a physico‑psychic approach.

Udana Vayu is in the vocal cord. 

The vocal cord controls Vaekharii Tattva which affects the expression of sound through the mouth. 

Thus Udana Vayu is related to the expression of sound, which is always influenced by Pranayama.

It means that Pranayama also affects Udana Vayu. 

Vyana Vayu has its contact with all the plexii and controls the flow of all fluids through Nadiis, veins, arteries, nerves, etc. throughout the entire body. 

The flow implies the presence of Vayu, otherwise the flow is not at all possible. 

Prana Vayu is converted into Vyana Vayu. 

This means Pranayama affects Vyana as well, and the flow of all the fluids through Nadiis. 

The vibration of the hemoglobin and each and every particle in the physical body is vibrating according to the rhythm of Pranayama. 

When adjustment has been accomplished between the rhythmic flow of Pranayama and vibrational flow of all the glands, sub‑glands, arteries, veins and each and every particle of the body, then only Kumbhaka Pranayama can be taught. 

It may take 6 months, 1 year or 2 years to reach that stage.

Thus Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana and Vyana Vayus are directly affected by Pranayama. 

The rhythmic impact of the internal Vayus affects the five external Vayus (Naga, Kurma, Krkara, Devadatta and Dhanainjaya) instantly. 

For example, when under the influence of Apana Vayu a portion of the food is transformed into stool and urine, and goes below. 

As a consequence, a vacuum is created in the upper portion. To fill it up, some other Vayu enters the place. 

This latter Vayu is known as Devadatta, whose scope increases gradually. It affects the Manipura as well wherein lies the Vrtti of Ksudha‑Trsna.

An impact on the gland of Trsna vibrates the conscious mind and there emerges the feeling "I am hungry".

Manipura controls the Vrtti of:
- Lajja
- Pishunata
- Iirsya
- Susupti
- Visada, Kasaya, Trsna, Moha, Ghrna and Bhaya. 


The effect on Trsna then and there creates the feeling of being hungry. 

When one is not having clear motions, scope of Devadatta does not increase, in that case one will not feel hungry and thirsty. 

How does Dhanainjaya Vayu work? 

Different nerve‑cells, nerve‑fibres, blood‑arteries, and glands of the human body get properly operated more in the sunlight, and get tired. 

**Moonlight increases this tiredness.** 

As a consequence, men sleep during the night under the influence of Dhananjaya. 

It is also best for them to sleep. 

There are certain animals whose nerves, nerve‑fibres, blood‑arteries and glands etc. get operated during moonlight such as owls and moles. 

During sunlight, they get operated so vigorously that they run away from sunlight and live in some dark place during day hours.

Pranayama physically affects the glands, nerves, nerve‑fibres, sub‑glands and also the flow of all fluids (Rasa, Rakta urine etc.), that is, all the liquid matter of the entire body. 

Pranayama is always done after having the mind concentrated over some Cakra which gets affected directly. 

In ordinary Pranayama, more importance is paid to Anahata. But under especial circumstances and at particular times, you concentrate your mind over other Cakras as well, even on Muladhara and Svadhisthana.

In Vishesa Yoga, mind is concentrated on several more Cakras during Pranayama. As a consequence, all these Cakras get benefited.

<!-- In spiritual practice you find that on the physical side Anahata gets the first chance, since  -->

The Prana‑Vayu is basically concerned with the lungs and heart, the controlling point of which lies in Anahata

But you will also find that the controlling point is also affected in spiritual Pranayama. This directly affects the Ajina Cakra (Pituitary), that is, the conscious mind. 


### Pranayama + Heart Chakra Develops Conscience

When a Sadhaka who practises Pranayama is faced with doing any improper act, they feel they should not do it. 

If their Iccha Shakti is weak, they will be unable to stop themselves from doing the evil act. But instantly they start repenting.

This is the direct effect of doing Pranayama. 

With the mind concentrated on the Ajina Cakra, Pranayama affects the particular cakra which is your point of concentration during Pranayama directly, and other Cakras indirectly. 


It also affects the entire body, since the controlling rhythm is the same. 

The first Pandava, Yudhisthira suggested that concentrating the mind on controlling points Lam, Vam, Ram, Yam, Ham, Tham etc. would bring better results. 

Yogiis experienced practically that this had a better impact. 

Since then, it has been decided that the point of concentration during Pranayama should be the controlling point of a particular Cakra:


Chakra | Controlling Points
--- | ---
Muladhara | Lam
Svadhisthana | Vam
Manipura | Ram
Anahata | Yam
VVishuddha | Ham
Ajina | T'ham

Since then it have been known as Yudhisthira Vidya.
