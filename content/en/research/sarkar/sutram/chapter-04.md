### 1. The tri-attributional primordial force (progenitrix of creation) flows on in endless triangular forms

<!-- Triguńátmiká srśt́imátrká asheśatrikońadhárá. -->


In Parama Puruśa, a countless number of linear waves are taking place in the different flows of sattva [sentient], rajah [mutative] and tamah [static].

Their triple-attributional flows go on evolving triangles or different other multi-conical or polygonal diagrams.

Even these polygonal diagrams are gradually getting transformed into triangles due to svarúpa parińáma [homomorphic evolution]. 

This triple-qualitative mátrkáshakti [primordial force] is endless.


### 2. In the triangle of forces, the 3 attributes of Prakrti are locked in endless mutual transformation

<!-- Tribhúje Sá svarúpaparińámátmiká. -->

In these triangles transformations go on back and forth endlessly:

- sattva into rajah
- rajah into tamah
- tamah into rajah
- rajah into sattva

These transformations are called svarúpa parińáma [homomorphic evolution].*

{{< n n="In Superphysics, these are the changes to the monad" >}}


### 3. Phase 1 (not yet a stage of actual manifestation)

In this stage:
- Prakrti is called Shivánii
- the witnessing Puruśa at the nucleus is called Paramashiva

<!-- Prathamá avyakte Sá Shivánii kendre ca Paramashivah -->

<!-- The thread wherewith  -->

The mid-points of these triangles are interwoven through the thread of Puruśottama, or Paramashiva.

In the initial stage of the triangular receptacles, these triangles keep their equipoise in the wake of developing forces.

This first stage is the pre-evolutional stage.

Hence, it is purely theoretical.

Prakrti is the creatress of these initial receptacles.
- She here is called Shivánii or Kaośikii
- The witnessing Puruśa is called Shiva.


### 4. Phase 2

This is when the germ of evolution sprouts:
- Prakrti is called Bhaeravii shakti
- the witnessing Puruśa is called Bhaerava

<!-- Dvitiiyá sakale prathamodgame Bhaeravii Bhaeraváshritá. -->

This leads to a loss of equipoise of the triangle.

The germ of evolution sprouts forth from any of the vertices. It moves forward as a straight line as per degrees of the guńas. 

This state is really the manifested state of Puruśa and Prakrti.

Here, Puruśa is saguńa [qualified] because Prakrti gets the chance to express Herself.

<!-- - Prakrti, as the creatress of this state, is called Bhaeravii 
-  the witnessing Puruśa is Bhaerava. -->


### 5. In the vibrational world there is a sequence of similarity of curvatures (homogenesis).

Here Prakrti is called Bhavánii and the witnessing Puruśa is called Bhava

<!-- Sadrshaparińámena Bhavánii Sá Bhavadárá. -->

In time, the internal clashes causes:
- the flow of forces to betray some curvatures
- the density of the Puruśabháva [stance of Consciousness] to decrease. 

<!-- In this very condition develops  -->

This leads to the first kalá [curvature]. 

The second kalá is similar (not identical) to the first.

The third is similar to the second, and so on.

So goes the kalá praváha [sequential or phasic flow].

This sequential evolution of kalás is called sadrsha parińáma [homogenesis, or similitude].

The mental and physical worlds evolve in these homogenetic waves.

The child of a human is a human and tree begets tree because of this (homoform) curvilinear evolution.*

{{< n n="A human cannot give birth to a tree because both have very different vibrations" >}}


The kalás are similar but not identical. 

The difference between 2 successive kalás is not clearly perceivable.

The differences between kalás will be clearly understandable the more distant their mutual relations are . 

 <!-- having distant -->

Although the physical changes of one whom we see every day are not understandable, we can certainly make out the difference if we see a child of 5, after 20 years, as a youth of 25.

Human begets human. But there will be a gulf of difference between a human of a million years ago and a human of today. 

The creatress of the manifest world is this sequential force called "Bhavánii shakti". Its witnessing Puruśa is "Bhava" which means “creation”.


### 6. The process of creation starts from Shambhúliuṋga

<!-- Shambhúliuṋgát tasya vyaktih. -->

The evolution from the theoretical stage to the practical manifestation dates from the very first expression of Bhavánii emanating from one of the points of the triangular receptacle. 

The common point of the theoretical and the practical evolution is called Shambhúliuṋga [Puruśa at the vertex of the triangle, the source of saiṋcara].

This Shambhúliuṋga is the root-point of the fundamental positivity, after which comes the náda [flow without any curvature], followed by kalá.


### 7. In the ultimate state of crudification, the paráshakti lying dormant at Svayambhúliuṋga is called the kuńd́alinii (“coiled serpentine”)

<!-- Sthúliibhavane nidritá sá kuńd́alinii. -->

The last expressional point is the fringe of the Bhavánii shakti. This point is the ultimate state of expression of force – the ultimate state of crudity.

In this state of crudity, the paráshakti [introversial pervasive force] that is lying in a quiescent state as the jiivabháva [finite subjectivity], is called the kulakuńd́alinii [“coiled serpentine”, or force of fundamental negativity].


### 8. The kuńd́alinii is the (force of) fundamental negativity

<!-- Kuńd́alinii sá múliibhútá rńátmiká. -->

The ultimate point of manifestation is called Svayambhúliuṋga. 

Svayambhúliuṋga is the ultimate point of negativity, wherein resides the kulakuńd́alinii force, quiescent and coiled like a serpent.

If Shambhúliuṋga be the fundamental positivity, then the kulakuńd́alinii, lying at Svayambhúliuṋga, we may call the force of fundamental negativity.
