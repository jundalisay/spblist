### 1-10. Due to the increasing influence of the guńas, clash occurs among the fundamental factors and bala (energy) is produced

<!-- Guńaprabhávena bhútasaungharśádbalam. -->

**The firmer the binding factor on the object body, the greater the internal friction in it.** 

This clash or play of forces is called bala or práńa [power or energy]. 

This práńa exists more or less in all objects or elements, although its expression has not taken place or does not take place in them in equal proportion.


### 1-11. The resultant interial force forming the nucleus within the physical structure and maintaining its solidarity, is called práńáh (vital energy).

<!-- Dehakendrikáńi parińámabhútáńi baláni práńáh. -->

The resultant force comes into being as a result of both external and internal frictions in the object-body.

If this force finds its own nucleus in some part of that body, the powers or energies active in that body are collectively called práńáh [vital energy].

The word práńáh is plural because it stands for 10 váyus [vital forces in the body].


### 1-12. Due to excessive clash, some crude matter is pulverized, and cittáńu (ectoplasmic particles), or mind-stuff, is evolved.

<!-- Tiivrasaungharśeńa cúrńiibhútáni jad́áni cittáńu mánasadhátuh vá. -->

If the manifestation of energy is too great in the object-body, some portion of the crude entity gets pulverized as the result of excessive friction in the object-body.

It gets metamorphosed into cittáńu [mind-stuff], which is subtler than ether. 

That is to say, mind is born out of matter.


### 1-13. Through the combination of ectoplasmic particles in the unit structure, the feeling of citta (objective mind) evolves

<!-- Vyaśt́idehe cittáńusamaváyena cittabodhah. -->

The sense of citta of that body is made up of the coordinated totality [brahma?] of all the cittáńus [ectoplasmic particles] that remain in the individual object-body centering around its totality.

This citta is the done “I”, or objective “I”, of the unit mind.

 <!-- shall remain all the perceptions, whether seen or heard, of  -->

An individual's perceptions remain unperceived, unless the citta identifies itself with their reflections on itself.



### 1-14. As the influence of the guńas wanes and rajoguńa becomes dominant, the aham (sense of doership) evolves out of the citta

<!-- Cittát guńávakśaye rajoguńaprábalye aham. -->

The attraction of Puruśottama [the Cosmic Nucleus] gradually makes the mind-stuff goaded forward under the influence of vidyá shakti [the introversial force].

THis makes:
- the predominance of tamoguńa gradually wane
- the increasing influence of rajoguńa become evident

The part of the mind-body where the predominance of rajoguńa is noticeable, is called the ahaḿtattva [doer “I” or owner “I”].


### 1-15. With further movement towards the subtle, the mahat evolves out of the ahaḿtattva

<!-- Súkśmábhimukhinii gatirudaye ahaḿtattvánmahat. -->

By the attraction of vidyá shakti, even the influence of rajoguńa over the ahaḿtattva gradually starts shedding.
- This indicates the predominance of sattvaguńa.

The part of the ahaḿtattva where the predominance of sattvaguńa is established, is called the mahattattva [pure “I” feeling].
