### 4. Saḿskára is a distortion of the mind-stuff waiting for expression.

 <!-- (i.e., a reaction in potentiality) is known as a  -->
<!-- Manovikrtih vipákápekśitá saḿskárah. -->

Actions create a sort of mental distortion. 

<!-- Virtuous or non-virtuous, whatever the act be, it begets   through vipáka, that is, -->

The mind regains its normal composure after undergoing the consequences of one’s actions. 

<!-- good or bad deeds. -->

Saḿskára is when action has happened, but its consequences have not realized.
- In this state, the reaction [vipáka] is suspended or deferred.

<!--  been gone through or served, that is, the vipáka has been kept in abeyance, such  is called 

 [reaction in its potentiality]. -->

At the time of death, unrealized reactions are held in the causal or unconscious mind. 

In order to realize those reactions, Prakrti connects bodiless minds with living structures in the wombs of different beings that have parallelism with those bodiless minds’ saḿskára-determined mental waves.


<!-- According to the nature of the saḿskáras  , Prakrti, in order to get those saḿskáras served through vipáka, effects the contact of the bodiless minds with living structures(1) in the wombs of different beings – living structures that have parallelism with those bodiless minds’ saḿskára-determined mental waves.  -->

This leads to the rebirth of that unit mind. 

One generally goes away after death with saḿskáras in accordance with one’s deeds performed during one’s lifetime.


### 5. In the bodiless mind there is no doership, no feeling of pleasure or pain

<!-- Videhiimánase na kartrtvaḿ na sukháni na duhkháni. -->

After the separation of the mind from the body after death, the unit mind no longer has cerebral nerve cells.

Partially, nerve fibres are necessary for the perception of pleasure and pain.

Because of this,  the sense of good and bad times cannot exist in the unit mind. 

<!-- (which the bodiless minds do not have after death). 

 the sense of weal or woe cannot exist in the unit, because for   -->

So the popular dogmas and beliefs that one's soul after death will be happy or miserable are completely wrong.

 <!-- So-and-so’s bodiless soul will be happy with such-and-such observances, or be unhappy and miserable with such-and-such acts, or will satisfy its revengeful propensities, are utterly and  -->


### 6. The sight of ghosts is created by the cittáńu (mind-stuff) in concentrated thought

<!-- Abhibhávanát cittáńusrśt́apretadarshanam. -->

Spirits and ghosts do not exist.

A frightened, indignant, or hypnotized person can attain temporary concentration of the mind.
- In such a case, his mind-stuff takes the form of the object imagined.
- He sees the vision of one’s thought

 <!-- without as well. -->

<!-- In such a state one sees -->

Thinking about ghosts and spirits in solitude, he or she sees them also in the open.

The external vision of the internal thought may be termed as positive hallucination. 

Conversely, in such a state of mind even the actually existent object may appear as non-existent.

This we may call negative hallucination. 

Those that say that they have seen a ghost do not lie. Only the delusion of the mind appears to them as visual perception.

If hypnosis be thoroughly introspective, one may mistake one’s own entity for a spirit or ghost.

In such an event the person behaves in such a manner that people start saying that So-and-so is possessed by a spirit. 

Theomania or theophanic possession is also of the same variety.
 

### 7. The requital of an action is guided by the (divine) longing for welfare

<!-- Hitaeśańápreśito’pavargah. -->

Behind the mechanism of fruits of actions is the divine desire of benevolence.

<!-- Even behind the requital of an act (the fruits that follow the completion of an act) lies   -->

The punishment for an evil act teaches one to keep away from evil doings.

The reward for a good and benevolent act teaches people that they will never get such a reward if ever they commit an evil act.


### 8. Out of the intense desire for mukti (liberation), one attains one’s sadguru (perfect master)

<!-- Muktyákáunkśayá sadgurupráptih. -->

When a vehement desire for emancipation wakes up in a person, he or she attains his or her sadguru [true spiritual preceptor] on the strength of that desire.


### 9. Only Brahma is the guru, no one else

<!-- Brahmaeva gururekah náparah. -->

Brahma alone is the guru.

Brahma alone directs the units to the path of emancipation through the media of different bodies.

 <!-- receptacles or -->

Only Brahma conforms to the real significance of the word “guru”.


### 10. Obstacles are the helping forces that establish one in the goal

<!-- Vádhá sá yuśamáná shaktih sevyaḿ sthápayati lakśye -->

Obstacles are the friends, not enemies on the path of sádhaná [spiritual practice].
- These only do service to a person.

These obstacles creates a battle against these obstacles. 
- This counter-effort alone carries the sádhaka [spiritual aspirant] to his cherished goal.

<!-- rages against them,  -->


### 11. Prayer and ritualistic worship become a source of confusion

<!-- Prárthanárcaná mátraeva bhramamúlam -->

It is useless to pray to God for something, for He is sure to give what is necessary.

Solicitation or importunity in the name of worship is nothing but toadyism and flattery.


### 12. Devotion is ideation on God, not flattery or ritualistic worship of God

<!-- Bhaktirbhagavadbhávaná na stutirnárcaná. -->

Being merged in the constant thought of God is devotion.

Devotion is not related to the chanting of hymns or ritualistic worship with different paraphernalia.

A devotee may perform these, but they are not an indispensable part of devotional sádhaná.
