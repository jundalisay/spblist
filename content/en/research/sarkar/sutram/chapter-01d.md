###  1-8. As the guńas increase their bondage, they express themselves fully in the emergence of the fundamental factors

<!-- Guńabandhanena guńábhivyaktih. -->

<!-- Guńa means “binding principle”. -->

The stronger the bondage on anything, the cruder the thing becomes.

Puruśa gives freedom to Prakrti to bind Puruśa.

The conscious Puruśa then gets metamorphosed into Mahattattva, Ahaḿtattva, citta, etc., under the ever-increasing binding factors.

and then as the result of the gradually greater and still greater 

The increased bondage of tamoguńa creates the following factors in degrees:

  <!-- there come into being as per degrees of crudification,  -->

1. Ethereal
2. Aerial
3. Luminous
4. Liquid
5. (ultimately) Solid

Even in the latter there are degrees of bondage.

On account of the firmness of bondage, the inter-atomic and inter-molecular distances decrease.

This decrease increases the internal frictions in the material body.

The external pressure of attributional bondage and the internal frictions compel more attributional expressions in the bodies of objects.

Here one should bear in mind that 

“Attributional expression” means:
- attributional manifestations, and
- attributional diversities

Attributional expression does not mean the excess of attributional capabilities.

{{< n n="Increased expression means increased diversity, not increased power" >}}



### The Aether

The ákáshatattva [ethereal factor] has the sound- carrying attribute. 

Assume we have 100 units of the ethereal factor as the ákáshatattva. which has the sound-carrying attribute. 

This gets metamorphosed into the váyutattva [aerial factor] because of the bondage.

This vayutattva has the touch-carrying attribute, in addition to the sound-carrying attribute.

<!-- If, suppose, we fix its measure at one hundred, in that case, when the ákáshatattva gets metamorphosed into the váyutattva [aerial factor] on account of greater static bondage,  -->

<!-- the attribute of touch is also expressed therein along with the sound-carrying attribute, but the attributional capacity remains what it is – unenhanced.  -->

The sound-carrying attribute wanes in the váyutattva as compared to the ákáshatattva.

But the combined measure of the sonic and the tactual attributes still remains at 100 units. [50/50?]

{{< n n="Some of the 100 units are now tactual, some are audible" >}}



### 1-9. Due to excessive pressure of the guńas, proper balance among the bhútas (5 fundamental factors) is lost and jad́asphot́a (explosion of matter) occurs

<!-- Guńádhikye jad́asphot́ah bhútasámyábhávát. -->

Even after the transformation of the object body into the solid factor [kśititattva], the onslaught of the binding principle can still continue unabated.

The equipoise of the elements gets lost and jad́asphot́a [explosion of matter] takes place.

As a result of this explosion, the solid factor [kśititattva], due to its excessive internal friction, gets pulverized into subtler elements completely or partially such as:
- ap [liquid]
- tejas [luminous]
- marut [aerial]
- vyoma [ethereal] factors

Its movement undergoes the process of negative saiṋcara.

{{< n n="In Phyiscs, this is called beta decay" >}}


The resultant subtler elements after the explosion retake the same old path of saiṋcara.

The ethereal element of the Cosmic Mind gets gradually cruder and cruder as per degrees of the ever-increasing flow of the guńas.

- From ákásha, or vyoma, to marut aerial
- From marut to tejas
- From tejas to ap
- From ap to kśiti

The more the progress of these metamorphoses, the more varied the attributional diversities noticeable in the material bodies. 

Their dimensions also get shrunk and diminished. 

**The dimensional contraction means the increase of internal frictions.**

This happens due to the excess or magnitude of the external attributional flow. 

Due to these excessive internal frictions, explosions take place in the material bodies and they get pulverized into subtler elements.

These explosions owing to hyper-attributional pressure occur only when **the degree of the tension of the solid element** becomes abnormally high as compared to other elements. 

In the absence of any wide disparities (either too high or too low) in the tensional relations of the elements, **living organisms come into being instead of explosion**.
