The genius that evolves from age to age through the process of introversion and extroversion of the intellect is bearing the message of the fulfilment of human potentiality.

At every step the warm breath of its labour and fatigue finds true expression: no one has the power to withstand this force. 

Those who want to transform their psychic wealth into inertness and inaction may perhaps obstruct this force of expression for a while, but the inner momentum of its dynamism will not be the least impaired. 

The very next moment it will break through all the dams of obstacles with a force increased a thousand-fold. That is why I say that it is through the fight against opposing forces that the intellect is awakened.

This very suppressed consciousness has laid the foundation of human civilization – has infused literary judgement with a refined outlook, and flavoured the taste of life with the nectar of Cosmic Bliss.

In every era literature has depicted the unique union of bliss (shreya) and objective pleasure (preya) in different modes according to the different phases of evolution to the characteristic self (svabháva). 

That which is antithetic to one’s nature, no matter how assiduously one might attempt to paint it with the colours of the imagination, can never be accepted by humanity as its own. 

If we liken Coastal Literature to the gala dress and Epochal Literature to everyday wear, then we will have to call this kind of impractical fantasy a dress of silvery tinsel. It has no use in life, nor has it any relation with the inner nature of human beings.

In order to give full expression to this continuous flow of humanity’s true nature, all three are necessary:
- insight
- power of expression
- boldness

The creation of ideal literature is not possible for those who are ever ready to yield to the pressures of the throng.

To manifest that true nature (svabháva), one will have to give a clarion call to the common people to struggle against those forces that want to suck dry their vitality.

Those voices which lack that bold heroism will simply whine and whimper doggerels in the name of poetry – they will try to save themselves from the responsibility of reality by counting the stars in the heavens.

All are moving forward. 

No one has come to sit idle, and so everyone will have to march ahead in harmony with all, maintaining a fine adjustment with the flow of life. Whether in thought or in action, in all spheres the fundamental characteristic of humanity is to move ahead. 

Where there is inertness, there is darkness. So one must not give the least indulgence to inertness in the spheres of thought and language. Inertness is just another name for the blind attachment to the past. 

For the sake of benevolence, for the sake of bliss, this attachment has to be cast aside. If an idea is likened to iron, then the dynamism of language shall be the touchstone. One must always be vigilant so that the iron will not lose contact with the touchstone. So before giving expression to any elevated idea, the litterateurs must seek out this touchstone, they must bring it under their control. 

Many people have ideas which do not blossom forth due to lack of mastery over language. 

Those who have ideas must develop their power of expression through continued practice and effort.

Those who possess the power of expression must make efforts to awaken their latent insight. 

The litterateur must possess both:
- expression
- insight

Where there is no iron, the touchstone is meaningless.

Power of expression does not mean merely an individual’s skill with language. It means the irresistible force of the mind and heart.

Where there is a lack of boldness and courage, there the language is prone to move with diffident steps, with hesitant deliberation. 

Such a timid language cannot express independent thinking due to the impact of the prevalent social superstitions and prejudices, the static bondages of the existing religions, the pressures of political ideologies of communalism and provincialism, and the false pride of nationalism and narrow-minded political ideas.

Thwarted by this impact, the weak language either stops moving or expresses itself with extreme diffidence, while following the policy of “kill the snake but save the stick.”

The root cause of this weakness lies in:
- the cowardice of individual life
- the blind attachment to the past. 

Litterateurs have to:
- assert themselves thunderingly
- give a stirring call to the people
- set aside all the garbage of impurities with a bold mind and with strong arms
- clear the path of human emancipation.

In the path of fulfillment, they must be the pioneers.

Here there may be a slight confusion with regard to the dynamism of language. 

The language, too, moves forward, keeping pace with the speed of thought.

At times the language of those whose thoughts cannot freely move forward under the weight of ignorance or prevalent superstitions, is also very forceful and dynamic.

Even the language of those who compose doggerels glorifying the greatness of a family, caste or pilgrimage, at times appears to be attractive and impressive. 

One can also write a thesis in powerful language on petty matters like “A Sneeze,” “A House Lizard,” or, before preparing for a journey, on “Best To Go North, Not East”; but such language I refuse to accept as truly dynamic language, for it bustles about within the iron railings of superstitions and attachments to the past. It has speed but no movement. 

A deep analysis will show that with all its acrobatics it has not moved even a step forward. Yoked to the millstone of superstition, like the bullock of an oil-mill, it has perhaps strutted proudly the whole day for fifty miles with brisk strides, but it could not move a step forward.
