My former boss, Ajit Singh, was attempting to get me demoted and himself promoted once more by writing to government officials in Delhi. 

He was of the firm conviction that his demotion was due to me, although this was far from true. He did not succeed in getting promoted; but he did succeed in getting me demoted. I received
information in September 1954 that orders of my demotion had been passed in Delhi
although formal orders were yet to be issued.

I have always been attached to the prestige of my status. I therefore felt restless to save my prestige. I was not able to get leave and go to Baba, therefore I wrote a letter about my problems to Baba. I also wrote in the letter that I would prefer
death to demotion and was least prepared to face a downfall in my rank.

When Baba received my letter He sent my relative and long-time friend Bindeshwariji, who was also a recent initiate, to find me in Begusarai. At the time however, I was in Khagaria for some work, but Bindeshwariji searched for me and
found me there. He delivered Baba's message to me and immediately returned to
Jamalpur.

Baba's instructions were, “He was given two mantras. He makes use of one, but not the other at all. He should be told to use the other one also and so the order of demotion will not move further”.

At this I immediately remembered the other mantra and began to follow the instructions in this regard. Meanwhile I also got leave and reached Baba's lotus feet in Jamalpur.

At first Baba scolded me on my writing about my death. “You consider death to
be a plaything”. Then He explained how promotion and demotion are part of a service
career and one should not be perturbed at these. He also told that attachment to the
status of a post is wrong. He advised me that it would be in my interest to accept the
demotion that was coming.

I was not at all ready to accept this situation. I enquired also what wrong I had
done to deserve this punishment. Baba said 'I know that you have done nothing in this
life to suffer a demotion in status. However this is a samskara of your past life and it
would be best to suffer it. Even so, I was not ready to accept it.

Baba then began to coax me in the same manner as parents do when a child
begins to insist on something and during this process Baba said, "All right Nagina - let
this be; that demotion will come when you want it".

I thought over Baba's words for sometime and then it came to my mind that
everyone in this world wants to rise. No one ever wants demotion. Baba is leaving me
with the option of my own demotion - which is it shall come when I want it and will not
come in case I do not want it. 

Therefore why should I think of demotion at all? I thought
that it was a good boon and why should I not accept it.
I told Baba, "I am ready for it".

Baba immediately said, “Let it be so”.I felt happy and went for a walk with Baba that evening.
Salutations to Baba the Great Protector of Protectors!


### MAINJU IS BROUGHT BACK FROM THE DEAD

My residence in Begusarai was in a lane.

One had to go about 25 yards from the main road, before one reached my second story residence.

After about a month, on a holiday, after getting ready, I walked down my stairs and came to the lane and walked a little to go to Baba - when I suddenly heard the cry of a child. 

When I turned back I saw that my domestic servant was trying to console my little daughter Mainju in his lap. She had started crawling at that time.

I asked what had happened, and was told that I had forgotten to close the small gate at the top of the stairs.

Mainju had been silently following me on her knees and when she tried to follow me onto the stairs, she toppled and fell down about 12 steps into the lane. 

Although she was not seriously injured she was shocked by the fall. It took time before she stopped crying and meanwhile I missed the train.

The next train left in the afternoon and I took that one to reach Jamalpur.

In the evening when I reached Baba's place, I did my pranam and accompanied Him on His walk. On  the way, Baba said

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
I expected you here in the morning
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Nagina" >}}
Yes Baba, I was about to go for the 10 AM train. But my young daughter fell so I missed that train. 
{{< /r >}}

Baba was somewhat pained to her about the fall of my little daughter and expressed His sympathy by uttering "Ch, ch, ch”.


{{< r a="Nagina" >}}
Baba, this girl should have been born in the palace of some king. She is so adamant even at this little age and dislikes any interference in her actions. 

If she is prevented from doing what she likes, her face reddens and she faints.
{{< /r >}}


Making myself more explicit I related an incident when she was moving towards a drain on her knees.

The servant stopped her and took her on his lap with great affection. At this she became so excited she turned red and fainted. 

The doctor who saw her also could not help. They say that she will be all right automatically when she grows up.


{{< l a="Baba" >}}
They are fools. If this continues for some time she will suffer permanent brain damaged and remain an idiot for the rest of her life
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Nagina" >}}
If it were a boy he could some how be handled even after becoming brain damaged, but for a girl it will be unmanageable for us
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Don't worry, give her vyapak shaoca (a hip-bath) regularly. In 3 days she will be temporarily cured and in 30 days she will be permanently cured
{{< /l >}}


Baba was extremely kind and also explained the method of vyapak shaoca.

Then He enquired whether any of my children had previously died. I said “No” and He replied “All right”. I returned home happy.

We needed a small tub for the half-bath.

 <!-- I was in search for one so that she could conveniently be bathed for thirty days,  -->

But unfortunately no such thing was available in the local market.

In this search one month passed. One day my wife and myself were talking that one month had passed and we had not been able to arrange the tub to give Mainju her baths as per Baba's instructions. I again showed my helplessness about getting a tub and did not know what to do. By Baba's gracefrom the day her ailment was mentioned to Baba, she had had no fainting. 

I told my wife, that Mainju has been alright from the time her trouble was mentioned before
Baba. Our duty only is to take things to Baba. He does the rest Himself.

In the meanwhile the arrival of my senior officer further delayed the acquisition of the tub and the bath for the baby. Next day I went to the station to see off my officer. 

The train was late, therefore by the time I returned from the station. It was nearly noon.

I therefore decided to go home, have lunch and return to office. So I came straight home from the station. As I approached my house I saw that many of my junior officers were standing on the balcony of my house. I was wondering why they were there.
