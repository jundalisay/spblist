Due to constant touring with the boss, I caught cold somewhere and began to feel pain in my back which subsided after taking some medicines. 

But I could still not go to Baba on the 24 October.

Meanwhile, perhaps on the first of November Chandranathji again came to us and when he found that I had not yet visited Baba he was somewhat angry and told me, "You should go there-even if it has to be on a stretcher. Do not delay after the fixing of a date." 

I explained to him that I was unable to go due to pain but now I would go as it is.

Accordingly, I reached Jamalpur on 2 November but was somewhat delayed that day and the meeting time for Baba was over. 

The next morning, on November 3, 1953, I reached Baba's place. 

<!--  at the appointed time. This was my first chance to meetHim, but I saw with wonder that it was the same divine and effulgent face that I had
seen in my vision some days before. 

I bowed to him most reverently.  -->

<!-- Thereafter there was a small drama of introduction . I say ‘drama’, because I know that Baba is ‘trikala jinanii’ or the knower of the past present and future of all
entities, as I had already experienced, yet He asked me for my name and went through
the formalities with me. I introduced myself formally and answered a few questions,
and thereafter the intiation began. -->

I was asked to sit in the lotus posture for initiation. Although I sat straight for a while, after some time I had to bend a little due to the increasing pain in my back.

When Baba saw me bending like this, He asked, "Can't you sit straight?"

I replied that for sometime past I had pain in my back and therefore, felt difficulty in sitting straight and requested Him to continue with the initiation - I promised that after the pain subsides I would sit straight.

As I said this Baba closed his eyes and said:

{{< q a="Baba" >}}
"Drink hot water and your pain will disappear
{{< /q >}}


After initiation, I asked Baba whether it was necessary to be a vegetarian for this sadhana - I told him that I could not live without non-vegetarian food.

Baba smiled and said, "Yet it is good to be vegetarian." 

He also added that onions and garlic have even more tamasika properties than meat and therefore, they should also be given up.

But how will it be possible for me to give up eating meat? I just cannot do it!

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Smiling "So far you have only given thought as to how meat can be eaten in the best form possible. You have perhaps, never given thought that it can also be given up. Just try to see whether you can give it up that way."
