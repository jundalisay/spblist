It had been announced on the third Sunday of November 1954 that another demonstration would take place on the final Sunday of the month, November 28th.

Once again the disciples gathered at Railway Quarter Number 339EF, arriving well in advance of Baba’s expected arrival. As usual, Baba was punctual. We did sastaunga
pranam and Baba blessed us.

For the third time, Baba called upon Shri P. K. Chatterjee as His subject. Shri Chatterjee sat asw before before Baba in the lotus position, and Baba asked him to
concentrate on his iista cakra.

Baba then addressed the kundalinii: “I Yogeshvar Anandamurti, order you to leave Muladhara and go to svadhisthana cakra”.

The kundalinii obeyed Baba’s command as we saw by observing the physical changes in the subject. Baba guided the kundalinii upward to manipura, anahata, vishuddha and ajina cakras, as He had done with this subject on November 14th. 

We witnessed the same subtle yet profound transformations in the subject’s physical appearance as the kundalinii rose.

Baba directed the kundalinii to the highest cakra, saharara. The subject became calm and peaceful. His face shone with a halo-like brightness.

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
What you see in this subject is the state of nirvikalpa samadhi, the highest possible realisation of Self that one can achieve”

Establishment in this stage is the attainment of moksa (final liberation) and it is the stage of nirguna Brahma (unqualified consciousness).
{{< /l >}}

<!-- We looked on in wonder, each with his own private thoughts, contemplating the bliss our brother disciple was experiencing. -->

Baba allowed the subject to remain in that state of spiritual bliss for about 5 minutes. 

Then He commanded the kundalinii to return to ajina cakra, where it remained while Baba once more permitted the subject to enjoy his blissful state.

When Baba uttered the command that would move the kundalinii to vishuddha cakra, the subject began to cry bitterly, imploring Baba to let him stay longer in that stage. Compassionate Baba afforded him a few more minutes in savikalpa samadhi.

At Baba’s word, the kundalinii again commenced its descent to vishuddha cakra. The subject began crying even more bitterly than before, begging Baba to let him remain where he had been. 

His desperate pleas so moved Baba that He agreed:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
all right, kundalinii, stay at ajina cakra for a while and let him enjoy divine bliss
{{< /l >}}


While the subject continued in his ecstatic condition, Baba explained to us various philosophical technicalities of this stage of samadhi.

After a few more minutes, Baba spoke to the kundalinii to guide it to vishuddha cakra. But the subject had by now become addicted to bliss. 

He began to protest frantically. He wept and begged and pleaded. 

This time Baba responded by getting a little tough. In a voice one might use to scold a disobedient pup, He commanded:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Get down now, you rascal!
{{< /l >}}

Instantly the kundalinii returned all the way to muladhara cakra.

Baba’s rough language and tone astonished me. In all the literature I had read, the great yogiis and saints never failed to address the kundalinii with the greatest respect, saying, ‘mother kundalinii’ in a deferential manner. 

I realized that Baba was a great personality whose powers went beyond those of the great yogis and saints.


Whereas others appeased the kundalinii and sought its cooperation in their realizations, Baba had total control of it. It was at Baba’s disposal any time He chose to command it.

The subject was now in a state of unspeakable grief. His kundalinii having returned to muladhara cakra, his moments of bliss had passed and left him shaken and bereft.

The sudden movement of the kundalinii from ajina to muladhara cakra was like a drop in body temperature from 108 degrees to 94 degrees.

The subject cried inconsolably, like a child without regard to surroundings, his age, station or the presence of others. 

Laying his head in Baba’s lap, he wept for a long time. Baba soothed and consoled him until he was quiet.

Thus it was that Baba permitted us to see a real-life, practical demonstration of nirvikalpa samadhi, the final aim of all yogis. In so doing, He also fulfilled His promise of 2 weeks earlier to grant Shrii P.K. Chatterjee another opportunity to experience spiritual bliss. 

<!-- Some day in the future, humanity may write about the bright disciples of Baba in golden letters. Along with those accomplished disciples were disciples like me,ordinary disciples with limited intellect. But in His compassion Baba loved us all equally. 

Side by side like brothers, all disciples basked in His divine love.  -->

When the demonstration was finished, I said:

“Baba, when You command the kundalinii to move from one cakra to another, it appears that various changes occur in
the subject’s body”.

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Yes, various signs will appear in the sadhakas body when the kundalinii moves up or down through the cakras. The kundalinii can have different ways of motion, and different symptoms will appear accordingly
{{< /l >}}


Baba described the many kinds of movement of the kundalinii and their manifestations in the body. To the subject, the movements may feel like those of a snake, or of an insect such as ant, or of a frog making a sudden leap.

<!-- These demonstrations increased our faith and devotion towards Baba.  -->

All these demonstrations took place in one quarter of the railway colony. 

<!-- Devotees now realised to some extent, that the One whom it takes lifetimes of penance to understand and to realise, has from His own mouth gives His own introduction in such a simple manner.

Sitting at Baba's feet we saw that to Him the mastery over life and death were but child’s play.  -->

We saw with our own eyes people enter savikalpa and nirvikalpa samadhi in a trice. The burning of accumulated samskaras (karma), mukti (salvation) and moksa (complete freedom from earthly bondages) came with the stir of His thought-waves. 

We saw voyages to stars and planets and the observation of conditions here being made without the slightest difficulty. 

News from every corner of the world and knowledge of circumstances everywhere, these wonders were to Him as common as the grass under our feet.

 <!-- Baba is so omnipotent. -->
