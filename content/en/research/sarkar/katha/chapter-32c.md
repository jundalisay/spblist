While under training in Delhi I received orders that I stood transferred to Hajipur, where I had to take charge immediately after training. 

On receipt of these orders I prayed mentally to Baba that I might be kept at one station for some length of time.

On being relived from Delhi by the end of August 1957 I reached Hajipur. 

Up to that stage there was little Ananda Marga pracar work there and I began it.

Most of the advocates of Hajipur were either my former schoolmates or college mates and I began discussing Ananda Marga philosophy with them. 

Although these people did not easily accept Ananda Marga sadhana, I met with some success and many took initiations. 

After initiation they began to perform sadhana with sincerity.

Meanwhile Acarya Deep Narainji and Acarya Kuldiipji also came on transfer to nearby Chak Sikandar and Hajipur. I began to receive cooperation from them also and pracar work proceeded speedily.

By now we had our unit in Hajipur and weekly dharmacakra was regular. After some time Acarya Shri Shyam Narainji also came to Sonpur and thus we began pracar work in Sonpur also.

After my posting at Hajipur, it appeared that Baba had granted my prayer for stability at one place.

By about the end of November 1957, I came to know that Baba was returning by rail from Betia after celebrating Dharma Mahacakra there on the occasion of the full moon night of Agrahana. He was returning via Muzaffarpur, I could not restrain myself and came to Muzaffarpur for Baba’s darshan.

The train arrived by eight or nine at Muzaffarpur. 

All the Margii brothers welcomed Baba with victory to Baba slogans. This was the first occasion I was meting Baba after January 1957. 

All the Margii brothers of Muzaffarpur were given an opportunity to have Baba darshan and to do sastaunga pranam. Thereafter came the turn of those who had come from outside. I was also one of these.

I was able to do my pranam in the train itself. I was overwhelmed at the time of
doing the pranam.

After inquiring my welfare Baba said:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Nagina seems unhappy with me these days?”

I said, “It is not so Baba, where shall I go if I feel unhappy at your feet? I feel, on the other hand, that my Baba is not pleased with me.”

When the train departed I began to wonder why Baba spoke to me like this.

After some thought I realized that I had not been unable to go to Jamalpur after I left in 1955. Now I began to think constantly about going to Jamalpur.

Days rolled on but I could not make a visit to Jamalpur. 1957 was closing and we were planning to celebrate the New Year in 1958, when Baba’s New Year’s message was received.

After the celebrations of the New Year’s day, Baba’s message was read out which read like this:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Do not compare life with a stagnant pool. Life is like a torrential stream. Its characteristic duty is to push forward pushing aside the obstacles and calamities on the way like implements of the road. 

Therefore, those who want to steer clear of difficulties and obstacles have lost the life of life. They are dead. The fit place for them is not society but the burial ground.
