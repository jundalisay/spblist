While I was in Jamalpur, Baba would feel pain whenever he looked at me.

<!-- First mentally I tried to find a reason for this, but I reached nowhere then I breached the subject, with those brother disciples
with whom I had developed some intimacy and who where in closer contact with Baba,
but they could also not enlighten me. Due to this I was now feeling ill at ease at
Jamalpur. However my routine continued as usual. -->

Then I saw in the newspapers that the flood havoc was worse near Muzaffarpur. This was near my village. In the evening while I was going for a walk with Baba, I mentioned about this flood.

Baba said, “Yes, for some days you should go to you village and watch the situation there.”

Although Baba thus allowed me to go to the village, it was not so easy to leave Jamalpur. Whenever I thought of leaving Jamalpur, I would feel very unhappy.

<!-- Jamalpur, where I got so much love from Baba and other brother disciples! It was difficult to leave this Jamalpur.  -->

I would feel very restless at the thought of leaving Jamalpur and for hours many events connecting Baba would rise and make my mind restless. Where and when at all I get this opportunity to have Baba darshan everyday and to do sastaunga pranam to Him? Where will this good fortune and happiness come from?

I would recall same lines of great poet Vidyapati which described my mental state in the following language:

“I got great happiness near you. Now my eyes flow with tears at the thought of leaving You. What is the use of japa and tapah and dhyana? Life is meaningful with just one glimpse of You.”

Only those brother disciples who are left behind in Jamalpur after Baba left that place will be able to appreciative my mental condition of these days. They also saw the barren Jamalpur after Baba left that place and felt the pangs of His absence. 

They continued to search and roam in every street, road, field and forest with tearful eyes those lotus feet that could give them solace even for a moment. Their pangs of separation were greater than those of the women of Gokul. They would touch the dust of Jamalpur’s streets to their forehead and feel his presence therein. 

In this context I am reminded of a story which I will relate here.
Once during the summer season, Rahim Khankhana along with his retinue and
horses camped at that place where in the ancient times the ashram of Saint Gautam
and his wife Ahalya was situated. Here once the husband (Saint Gautam) cursed his
wife and she became crude like stone. She became alive again after God Ram touched
her with his feet. There some elephants of his camp began to be the in the tank and
began to play in the water. When the mahouts took them out of the tank for resuming
the journey, they began to throw dust upon themselves with the help of their trunk.
Rahim Khankhana was a great poet of has time and in those days [poems were
also composed in the style of answering a question or problem. Some poet presented
this problem before Rahim when he saw these elephants taking both in dust after the
tank bath.

“Why are the elephants putting dust on their own heads?”

Rahim replied in his poem:
“They are searching for the dust which brought the wife of the saint back to life.”
How beautiful was the reply. Today the devotees of Jamalpur are similarly
overwhelmed by devotion and searching their Lord in every particle of dust of
that hallowed town.
I was very reluctant to leave this Jamalpur and my mental state of those times
is indescribable.

### MY MOTHER TAKES INITIATION AND IS SAVED FROM DEATH

Before leaving Jamalpur, I had asked Baba about the initiation of my mother and Baba had instructed me to tell my mother all that I myself was doing. After two or three days I returned to my village with a heavy heart. My village is very much in the interior. 

In those days transport facilities were very rare. Even today the nearest bus-stand is four miles away, and the nearest railway station is six miles away. As a result through rainy season coming and going to the village is a problem. For education and health, one has to depend on Muzaffarpur, which is eighteen miles away from my village. 

The nearest medical care was an ayurvedic doctor, Shri Alakh Niranjan Pathak at Bariarpur about two miles away from my village. After my father’s death my wife and children had come back to the village and my mother had asked them to remain there itself.

After reaching the village I pressed my mother to start doing sadhana and she agreed. I initiated her as told by Baba and she began to do Sadhana. The rains were heavy and at such a time my second son Mohan fell ill. 

At that time he was only 9 years old. He was being given medicine by Dr. Pathak who as an Ayurvedic Physician. While this treatment was or, after two days at about nine o’ clock in the night his condition become worse, he began to sink. All the members of the family felt very much worried and I was also at my wits end.

Meanwhile I remembered Baba and I began to pray to Him for the restoration of
the health of this child. 

At that time it was raining heavily, even so I sent two persons with a lantern to Dr. Pathak who was two miles away. After this I again began to pray to Baba. 

Even before the doctor came. The child’s condition began to improve a lot. Dr. Pathak reached at about twelve o’clock in the night on foot, and after examining the boy began his treatment.

That night the doctor stayed with us. In this situation Baba alone was my support and by his very grace my son could regain his health.

Dr. Alakh Niranjan Pathak had taken initiation at Jamalpur only a few days, back. Therefore we developed intimacy. Our families knew each of her for many generations.

The rains were over and the winter had not yet started and my wife fell
ill. She remained ill for a long time. She became exceedingly weak. She was also
wanted the treatment or the same Dr. Pathak, but there was no sign of any
improvement. Now we wanted to call a doctor from Muzaffarpur and show her to him or
wanted to take her to Muzaffarpur, when that very evenings her condition began to
deteriorate. She began to fall unconscious again and again. All the members of the
muffle became very much worried, Dr. Pathak also came and after remembering Baba,
began to introduce some change in his treatment.

I continued to pray to Baba whilst sitting in a secluded place. At about midnight
my wife fell asleep. That night also Dr. Pathak remained in our house. When my wife
woke up in the morning. She told us that she would recover very soon, and there was
no need to call a doctor from outside.

I said, “This is fine, but tell me on what basis you are saying that you will
recover very soon?”

She said:

“In the last quarter of the night I felt as if I was neither asleep nor fully
awake. In that condition, I saw that Baba as bright as the sun is coming on a chariot.
Baba was most effulgent and divine. I could not look at His brightness. 

The chariot and the horses were also shining in this effulgence. His chariot came and stopped just in front of me. I fell at his feet. Baba’s right hand lifted up in the abhaya mudra and a light emerged from that hand which fell on all my body. 

There after my sleep was broken.”In fact, my wife’s health began to improve everyday and in just a few days she recovered fully. Meanwhile my contact with Dr. Pathak became closer and we began to
spend more time in spiritual conversation.
