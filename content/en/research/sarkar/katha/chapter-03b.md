In July 1864 one Englishman out hunting with his 2 dogs, and confronted a tiger in the field bordering the jungle. 

No one knows how long they fought, but both died as a result of this encounter. 

In the morning, people found the tiger dead whilst the wounded Englishman had crawled home and died there. 

<!-- The people must have felt sorry for the death of the brave hunter, but they felt that the man with arms and the wild animal without any weapon must have fought bravely and long and no one could say as to who won and who lost. Therefore  -->

The Englishmen constructed 2 graves there, one for the hunter and one for the tiger.

Baba preferred to sit on the grave of the tiger as His resting place during His daily walks in that field. If someone else was sitting there, He would sit on the Englishman's grave.

While sitting on these graves Baba guided many souls and gave many demonstrations of mystical states, contributing much to the spiritual knowledge of humanity. 

<!-- These were the places where some disciples attained liberation and many ordinary disciples like myself saw Baba’s loving and compassionate guidance in their daily lives, both spiritual and worldly. -->

<!-- This sacred field of Jamalpur screened with green and lofty hills, and containing
in its bosom those graves, palms and other trees, has been the silent and mute witness
of the liilas and grace of Baba for decades. 

Had these graves and trees been fitted with vocal chords, they would have narrated the history of Jamalpur for hundreds of years and also told the story of Baba right from his childhood day s for the entire period of his stay in Jamalpur. -->

Near these graves stand three tall palm trees in a triangle where Baba used
sometimes to sit also. Under these palm trees many fortunate brothers got their
initiation from Baba.

<!-- By these graves or under these trees many great souls either in physical or
subtle bodies, had wandered eagerly for a glimpse of the lotus feet of Baba. On this
grave Baba gave innumerable teachings, and enumerated diverse subjects. Hardly any
subject on spirituality or morality has been left undiscussed in these environs. -->

When Baba would sit on the tiger’s grave the triangle of the palm trees would
be behind Him and on his right was a banyan tree. 

<!-- On the left was the grave of the
English hunter and one mango tree. The palms at the back were about forty of fifty
yards away. The grave and the mango tree were about ten to fifteen yards away on the
left. -->


Baba told us that this the banyan tree was a notorious dacoit in its past life, extremely callous and murderous. He now stands converted into this tree.


## KARNA’S KINGDOM OF ANGADESH

 <!-- Baba was seated on the grave of the tiger and I was sitting at His feet.  -->

One evening, Baba was looking at a distant hill on his right. 

<!-- After some time breaking his silence Baba pointed out, -->

“Nagina, look at that distant bill. That was the boundary of Angadesh, the kingdom of Karna 3,500 years ago. 

His capital was where Nathnagar in Bihar is situated today. Once the Pandavas attacked Karna in the night taking him completely by surprise. 

As it was night-time, by the time Karna recollected his army and wits, the Pandavas had destroyed a big part of his army. 

But once Karna came into his own, he fought a terrible battle and pushed the Pandavas back. He continued the battle with the Pandavas as long as he did not drive them out complete from his kingdom”.

<!-- Baba’s liilas of Jamalpur are unforgettable. Now this mind of mine which was never satiated with His affectionate and magnetic company, only yearns in pain to think of those days. Since then all the devotees of Jamalpur are waiting anxiously for those days to return and waiting for the revival of these sweet days and their memories. -->

After Baba left Jamalpur, Jamalpur is in the same condition as Braj, the
childhood home of Krsna, was, after Krsna left it for Mathura. Jamalpur is now giving a
deserted look like Braj. 

Now we are reminded of that beautiful poem of Surdas where
he describes the pangs of separation of the residents of Braj in these immortal lines:
“Who can describe the story of Braj? The gopiis and the cows the cowherds, Everyone is lean and sad in the memory of Krsna”

Although Baba has left Jamalpur to fulfill his mission, just as Krishna had left Braj, yet every particle of dust of Jamalpur is vibrating with the contact of his holy feet
and is unwilling to forget those happy days. Even today the devotees of Jamalpur although weak in body due to pangs of separation from the lord are keeping his memory fresh.

Not that Jamalpur alone is yearning for Baba. Baba also in his quiet moments
must be remembering Jamalpur with love and longing affection. He must also be
saying like Krsna in the words of Surdas: -

“Uddhava I am unable to forget Braj.”

I feel satisfied that like this, Baba must be remembering all of us devotees,
whenever be must be thinking of Jamalpur.

By His many years in Jamalpur Baba has made it a sacred place not only for Ananda Margiis but for all humanity and posterity.

Therefore it is my earnest plea to Baba that He may fill this sacred place to the brim with overwhelming devotional sentiment so that every sadhaka who visits here may be plunged deep in the ocean of love and spirituality. Let Jamalpur acquire immortality.
