Economically speaking, Ananda Margiis have always been lower middle and middle class people.

They are, therefore, always in want.

Due to lack of financial means, the propagation of Marga ideals and the expansion of the organisation was not taking place as rapidly as required.

Therefore, while I was at Jamalpur, the same Margiis approached me, that we may all request Baba to become Kalpataru. 

When He becomes Kalpataru and gives us an opportunity to ask our hearts desire, we shall ask for the only boon that the economic difficulties of the Marga and the Margiis may be removed.

Looking at the economic difficulties of the Marga and the Margiis I also agreed with them.

It was decided that we should reach the field that very day and when Baba has taken his seat on the grave we may all request him to become Kalpataru. 

Having thus decided that day I could not go to Baba’s residence as usual for doing my pranam. All of us reached the field earlier than Baba and began to wait for Him staying at about 20 to 25 yards away from the grave.

Baba normally used to sit on the tiger’s grave. But that day some other people were sitting there already. We therefore thought that Baba would sit that day on the grave of the English man.

So one of us flashed the torch several times to see if Baba had come to this grave, but saw no one. 

We waited for long and when we got up and walked to the Englishman’s grave.

As we approached, we were all surprised to see that Baba was sitting there. The wonder was that only from a distance of 20 or 25 yards with the help of the torch we were unable to see him while he was sitting there. I asked Baba how long He had been there.

Baba replied, “I have been sitting here for long. You people had thrown the torchlight on me several times”

In fact throwing torchlight again and again at Baba was an act of discourtesy and impropriety. After Baba told about the torchlight we all felt guilty and bad and none of us had the courage to ask Baba to become the Kalpataru.

Although we felt disappointed we took solace in the thought that everything happens as per His wish and nothing can be dose without his wish. However another brother disciple and myself did a 2-day fast for our fault.

The third day it was Sunday and Baba was coming to the ashram. I was still on fasting and the other disciple got ready and reached the railway quarter for Baba’s darshan.

I was feeling somewhat weak and therefore did not go to the ashram. I was thinking to continue the fast up to the time Baba become pleased again. But that brother disciple returned in great disappointment from the ashram. 

As he returned he asked me to give up my fast. 

He said that Baba was very angry in the ashram about the fast of some Margiis. We had undertaken the fast as a measure of penance and to please Baba and what happened was just the opposite. 

As I was pondering on what he said, he left to take his food.

When he returned after having his meal, he began to pressure me also to give up my fast.

While I was still thinking what to do, he brought food for me also. Now Bindeshwariji and his elder brother Puneet Babu also began to press me to give up the fast.

Under this circumstances. I had to give up the fast with a heavy heart. From the time I had come to Baba, this was the first occasion that I missed putting a request to Baba and placing my desire before him. 

After this disappointing event I felt hesitant to appear before Baba for some time.

After this event I have never seen Baba becoming Kalpataru in my life. This is my ill luck. I wonder when Baba will give me such an opportunity again. 



## ALL WORLDLY WOES DISSOLVE IN BABA’S PRESENCE

I got one particular realisation in the contact with Baba. 

While beset with worldly worries and in a greatly agitated state of mind I approached Baba many a time with the view to mention my troubles to Him. After reaching Him I either completely forgot my worldly worries or began to wonder with a quiet mind whether it would be proper to mention my worries to Him.

Is He not aware of my condition? Some time it happened that in an extremely disturbed and painful state of mind I went to Him with full determination that this day I would surely relate to him my tale of sorrow, but I would becomes quiet as soon as I reached Him.

Once in such as state of mind I went to Baba and did my sastaunga pranam, but while I was still prostrated before Him, He asked, "Do you want worldly wealth or spiritual salvation?”

I began to think, and my eyes were concentrated on Him.

The eyes want to absorb His charming beauty and the ears were busy in listening to the nectar of His
sound and the mind remained most happy with all this.

Particularly in DMCs devotees are concentrating their eyes and ears on Baba with greatest attention to listen to the discourse and to see Baba. All the sensory withdrawal processes of the shuddhis prescribed in sadhana automatically take place
when we are in His presence. 

Although devotees float on the waves of many emotions, yet their object is one, that is, Baba. At that time they attain that indescribable stage which the great Saint Tulsidas has described in the following words:

“The tongue has no eyes and the eyes have no tongue, so how can God’s great beauty be described?”
