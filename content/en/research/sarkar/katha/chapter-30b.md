During this period another of my childhood friend took initiation in Muzaffarpur.
Later on he became acarya. Gaunga Sharanji and myself were together in our school
days and stayed in the same hostel although Gaunga Sharanji belonged to
Muzaffarpur itself, yet his father got him admitted into the hotel for getting proper
environment for studies. From the very beginning his life style was that of arch family.
After leaving school Shri Gaunga Sharanji joined Benders Hindu University and
studied science, while I continued my studies at Muzaffarpur.

In the meanwhile I joined
service, after years I met him again in 1951. Those days, I was also posted at
Muzaffarpur. We recalled our younger days and began to live again as close friends.
Those days, Shri Gaunga Sharanji was an Inspector in Indian Life Insurance Company
and his profession required him to mix with rich ask well-to-do people persons. He had,
therefore, imbibed all the qualities of that class. He was already fond of luxurious food
and clothing.

Meanwhile, I was again transferred from Muzaffarpur and we reported
again. After four years, I was again transferred to Muzaffarpur. By them, I had become
a Sadhaka of Ananda Marga and by Baba a Grace had also become an acarya. Due to
our old friendship and intimacy, I explained to him the philosophy of Ananda Marga.
For a couple of days he heard me and then he expressed a desire to be initiated. But
he put down one condition that he was not prepared to accept any restriction on his
food and other living habits. Really, by then, drinking and smoking had become his
regular habits. I said, alright, if you cannot give up any of these habits then you will not
start any new ones, to which he agreed.

I said the mantra has a force of its own and after initiation when the mantra was
imparted to him he would have to practice meditation with the mantra with devotional
regularity. After a little thought he agreed. I said, if these habits of yours start being
dropped your would at least not cling to them willfully? He agreed to this also. Then I
told him that he could be initiated wherever he wanted. I would take him to another
acarya who would initiate him. He asked me as to why I was not Initiating him I told him
than we were chums since our boyhood & therefore it would be in the fitness of things if
he got the initiation from some other acarya. But he began to insist that I should initiate
him, and he stuck to this. Next Sunday was therefor fixed for the date of initiation.
On Sunday, he arrived at the given time and took initiation. This was my third
opportunity to initiate someone. After initiation almost everyday he used to meet me
and after about week he informed me that he no longer felt like drinking. I reminded
him that if his interest was lost he should give up drinking when after three days he
meet me again, he informed me that he had given up drinking up drinking. After a
couple of days, he expressed a desire to have the darshan of Baba. I asked him to dosadhana for some more days and then I would take him to Baba. But he insisted on
Baba darshan and would not listen. I tried to convince him in many kinds of ways, but
he was adamant.

I then told him to do his sadhana intensely and create a strong desire for guru
darshan, “Then Baba will give you darshan at the very door of your house”, I said.
Hearing this he began to think and returned home.
After about five or six days he came to me at about eleven in the night and
began to ask me the meaning of “Shubhamastu”. I was a bit surprised, as this is the
way Baba blesses his disciples. He has not yet had Baba’s darshan, how is he then
referring to Shubhamastu?

Upon my enquiry, he informed that, “Today when I was doing my pranam, I saw
two legs up to the knees and I heard this blessing and I further heard in Bengali
language the words, “I am mad and all mine are mad!”
He was relating his experiences and I was getting overwhelmed with emotions
as I was hearing him. Praise be to the Lord that He comes to hear the prayer of His
devotees in person.

After a few days, he got all the members of his family initiated. By now he had
also given up smoking. He received the love and affection of Baba only a few days
later in Patna. He had been doing sadhana with regularity and sincerity right from the
day of His initiation and therefore very soon he had the special grace of Baba. His
sadhana was full of devotion. Due to this, very soon he became tattvika and acarya.
Later on, he was initiated into Tantra sadhana.

As an acarya, Gaunga Sharanji was a very industrious and courageous person.
He propagated the philosophy of Marga throughout North Bihar and gave sadhana to a
great number of persons. Many of those whom he initiated are tattvika and acaryas
today. It is by his efforts and grace of Baba that the Marga spread rapidly throughout
north Bihar. His devotion to sadhana and fondness for propagating the ideology were
both praiseworthy and unfailing. He is found with a smile in the most difficult
circumstances, full of courage, bravery, valour and perseverance. Steadfastness was
his nature, his conversations are full of humour and satire and the sharpness of his
intellect and his clear logic flow from his talk.

Many a time, Gaunga Sharanji solved difficult problems and managed critical
situations, through sheer wit and originality of approach. His study of philosophy was
deep and he had his own particular way of making philosophical subjects easy and
interesting. He converted the dry philosophical discussions into very moving,
interesting and lovely events. His devotion was infectious. He had a rare combination
of devotion, sentiment and knowledge and was decorated by a rich combination of all
these. He is an example before the world as to what sadhana can make of such a
luxury-loving princely hunter of a man. Now he is the embodiment of simplicity. Service,
sacrifice and charity have become regular parts of his life.
It was he who immediately registered an acre of land in the name of the Marga
when the question of constructing a jagrti in Muzaffarpur came up in 1960. He left his
body to attain salvation on the 22 October 1981.
