<!-- Salutations to Baba Who Grants the Desired Boon -->


One evening instead of going for a walk Baba came straight to the ashram. It was around May or June of 1955. For sometime, Baba talked with the manager of the ashram in His room and I continued to wait on the inner veranda with five or six other people.

After finishing His talk with the ashram manager Baba came to the inner veranda. As He came out of the room, one of the other disciples was the first to salute Him and Baba asked him, "What do you wish?"

<!-- Baba was speaking in an unusual manner, so I slipped back a little just to assess the situation before facing Him. By now Baba had sat on a cot in the veranda and asked all of us to sit in front of Him.

Then Baba called the brother disciple who was nearest and asked him, "What do you wish?" -->

He asked for his kalyan, (salvation or realisation). 

Baba said, "You will attain your own kalyan much earlier than your death".

Then came the turn of the next brother. He asked for his own salvation and the boon of doing service to humanity. Baba blessed him to attain his own kalyan in this very body and asked him to specify the number of people he wanted to serve (jan kalyan). He indicated the number and Baba blessed him with the boon of salvation and service to humanity with this body.

Then came the turn of the third brother, who had a strange request.

He asked, “That the "Qualified Brahma may be liberated from its causal qualifications" (the cessation and merger of the universe in the Cosmic Consciousness).

Baba said, "Kalpataru can not grant such a boon. You ask for something else".

This brother disciple was more of a philosopher and was not ready to change his request. 

Baba then explained to him why such a request was against the cosmic will, but he still did not change his request. 

Thereafter he asked for the boon to be made nirman citta. 

Baba again asked him to ask for something else, but as he did not want to change his desire so he sat to one side. By now we had all realised that Baba had become Kalpataru.

The fourth and fifth gentleman also asked for their own salvation and the boon of doing service to a certain number of human beings. Baba granted them the boon of their desire.

Now in the end it was my turn. I did my sastaunga pranam and sat at Baba’s feet. 

Baba asked me also, "What do you wish?"

I said, "Salvation of the self and service to humanity".

Baba said, “Jan kalyan is a vague term with vast implications. Fix a limit on it”.

I asked that the largest number of people might attain their salvation through Ananda Marga on this planet. Baba instructed me to be even more clear and specific. 

I said, “May at least 51% of the human race attain their goal in life through my medium.”

Baba enquired whether I wanted both my wishes to be fulfilled through the present body itself. He queried whether service to humanity to this extent is possible through the medium of one body.

I replied, "I certainly want my salvation in this very body and if for service to humanity I have to take another body, I have no objection to that”. 

Baba said, "In that case the second body would mean nirman citta".

I said, “I do not know what is nirman citta. Only those who are such can know. All I want is to serve humanity”.

Baba was pleased with my reply, placed His hand on my head and blessed me, “Tathastu. As you wish."

I did my sastaung pranam to the Lord and accompanied him on His walk.

Next day the ashram manager told me that Baba had said to him, “Others asked for salvation or nirman citta directly and did not get them, but Nagina got both.” 

This was a great grace of Baba that I received such a blessing from Him.

### Baba Cures Me Again

Once while I was staying with Bindeshwariji in Jamalpur, I fell ill. A flu epidemic was at its height then and I also fell victim to it. 

If I had a fever that continued for more than 2 days, it would always develop into a long bout of incurable nausea and vomiting from the next day until the end of my fever.

Sometimes I would vomit 25 times in one day. 

My breath would be so foul that I would not like to even open my mouth. When I opened my mouth I would again feel nauseous because of the bad smell.

To allay the foul odour, especially before taking any medicine, I would wash and disinfect my mouth with warm water mixed with antiseptic and then take the medicine.

It became difficult to even talk and so like a mute person, I mostly used to explain my intentions by gestures or through muffled sounds.

During these bouts, I had a peculiar tendency that I could not even keep medicine down. The vomiting would only stop once the doctors started administering intravenous glucose to prevent dehydration and to provide nutrition. 

Only my wife and my domestic assistant knew this. Only these two could tend to me during illness.

During the flu epidemic, both my wife and our assistant were at my village. I therefore asked Bindeshwariji to either send me to the village in the care of one of his domestic staff or call my domestic assistant from there by telegramme. 

Bindeshvariji did not accept my suggestions at all. 

He thought that perhaps I was not comfortable enough at his residence and therefore wanted to leave. He would not think of sending me to my village, and as far as the question of calling my own domestic assistant was concerned, he was not prepared to admit that he would not be able to serve me just as well himself. In this situation I had no option but to keep quiet. 

In the meantime, he also called a doctor without my knowledge. The doctor examined me and started writing a prescription. I warned the doctor not to prescribe any medicine with a bad taste or I would not be able to swallow it. 

The doctor wrote the prescription and left and Bindeshwariji went with him, returning with lots of medicine and fruits for me.

By now my mouth was feeling and smelling foul. I was spitting constantly and somehow managed to swallow the pills, but could not take the mixture at all. With Bindeshwariji’s constant persuasion I contrived to swallow one dose but had to vomit immediately.
