It was the winter of 1953-54 and the weather was bitterly chilly. 

Baba allowed me to go for a walk with Him and as usual.

<!--  we came back in the field
and seated ourselves on the grave. I was sitting by the side of Baba.

Two more sadhaka brothers were there. -->

Mostly Baba used to sit on the grave for a long time. But that day, Baba started to walk back by quarter-to-nine. 

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Let us go, Nagina has a cough! 

Nagina, have you brought your muffler? You must use a muffler during winters
{{< /l >}}


I said, "During winters I generally get a sore throat. It will be alright by itself".

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
You have a cough due to liver trouble. Put hot water in a half cup full of orange juice, so that the juice and water become warm.

Drink it just before going to sleep. Remember this will be your last drink before sleeping. You will eat or drink nothing thereafter. You will be normal within a few days.

On returning home, I followed Baba's advice. The cough disappeared forever.

<!-- I was overwhelmed by this kindness of Baba and considered myself fortunate that I had surrendered my self to Him. -->


## BABA TREATS ALL EQUALLY – THE INNER OFFERING

After some time, I was again fortunate to go one Sunday to Jamalpur for Baba's darshan.

<!-- As I reached Jamalpur, I met a senior disciple of Baba. He asked me whether I had come for Baba's darshan and informed me that he was just returning from Baba's house. He told me that Baba was going out to meet someone at four in the afternoon. He therefore advised me to go immediately to Baba or it would not possible to see
Baba without having to stay over to the next day. -->

It was winter, and I did not have warm clothing, so, I knew I could not stay
overnight, and I resolved to have darshan that very day. 

At that time I was wearing pant, shirt and coat. I felt odd, because I had always visited Baba in Indian clothes of dhoti and kurta. My disciple brother felt irritated as we were short of time and asked me what was wrong in going to Him in those clothes. On his insistence, I went to Baba in
the same clothes, and he accompanied me, but he said that he already had Baba's
darshan and therefore, he would stay outside.

I wanted to go via the railway station market, so that I could buy some fruits for
Baba. He enquired why I wanted to go via the station, as it was a longer route. I replied
that I wanted to buy fruits for Baba. My friend asked me to stop the car, and he got out
of it in hurry.

He said, "If you have to take fruits for Baba, then go alone. But know well, that if you are turned out today, never again will you be allowed to enter there."I was perplexed, but anyhow I dropped the idea of purchasing fruit. 

Then at my request, my friend again got in the car, and we went together to Baba's house. He remained in the car outside, and I went into Baba's drawing room for His darshan.

Baba came, and I touched His feet, I immediately felt immensely peaceful and satisfied.

After some talk on my meditation I asked Baba, "Baba today, before coming here I wanted to buy some fruits for you, but the sadhaka brother stopped me and said that you would not like it, and would prohibit me coming to your house again. 

Baba, it is our tradition that one does not go empty handed before one’s guru, God and the king. If nothing else, one should take some green leaves, flowers or fresh water."

Baba listened to me with a smile, and in very loving words said, "Your sadhaka brother is perfectly right. I have asked all my disciples not to bring anything for me, whether fruits or anything else. It is true that in the olden days, the guru wanted the disciple to offer him fruit. But which fruit? The guru used to tell the disciples that whenever you come to me offer me the fruits of all your actions. 

The disciples acted accordingly. But in the course of time the guru's lost their greatness and gradually instead of ‘karma fruit’ - they began to accept big sweet and juicy fruits. Now this has
become customary. You are also free to offer the fruits of your actions whenever you
like”.

Baba then added, "Some of your sadhaka brothers are not well off
economically. If I accept fruits offered by you, your poverty-stricken brothers will also
make an attempt to do so. Certainly this will put them into difficulty and they will cut
their necessities in every way to bring a few fruits for me. If I do not accept their fruits,
this will mean discrimination between disciples, and if knowing fully well their economic
difficulties I accept the fruits, this would amount to blood-sucking. Would you like Baba
to discriminate between His disciples?”

I was unable to reply. There was nothing I could say. Baba went on, "Nagina,
what can a disciple offer his guru? He should really ask from Him whatever he desires!”
I told Baba, “Sometimes when I see good things, I feel that I should bring that
thing for You. What should I do in such a situation?”

Baba replied, "In that case, you should offer me that thing then and there. I shall
have received it and then you can take it by way of prasad".

I was so much lost in conversation with Baba that I could not refer to anything
about my fear complex. Afterwards also I had Baba’s darshan, but unfortunately I
always forgot to mention this to Baba. This tendency of fear is still with me in some
form or the other. Baba alone knows when He will free me from this.
At this time, I had, against my will, to appear before Baba in western clothes of
trousers and shirt, and as long as I was at His feet I felt somewhat embarrassed due to
this.

When I bowed at His lotus feet to permit me to go. Baba blessed me and then
asked. "You also have to put on these clothes?”

I told Baba that I had to dress like that for the office, and Baba said, "You are
doing the right thing. You should always protect your sattvaguna (sentient qualities)
with the shield of rajoguna (mutative qualities); otherwise people will not allow you to
be a sattvaguni (upholder of sentience).”In continuation of this Baba said. "A disciple should always come to the guru like an innocent child. 

Suppose you have a child at home, and you are beautifully dressed to go out somewhere and that child comes all in dust and wants to sit on your lap and becomes restless for it. That child does not know that he would spoil the clothes of his father. 

But as a father, you pick up the child and take him on your lap without a thought about your clothes becoming dirty. In the same way a disciple should
come to his guru".

These teachings of Baba inspired me to come still closer to Him. As a consequence whenever I go to Baba I always do so like a child. Baba's teachings had a profound impact on my heart and I adopted His teachings and again bowed at His Lotus Feet very humbly requesting Him to give me so much of self-confidence that I might follow the path shown by Him without ever getting tired. So far He has supported me at every step. 

I pray that it may continue like this forever.
