6. In Margiya News and Notices appearing on the 3rd cover page of the 2nd issue of Ananda Duta published in 1956 it, has been said: 

Shri Prabhat Rainjan Sarkar has taken over as president of AMPS. 

Because of paucity of time, the ex-President Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiji withdrew Himself form pracar work and directed Shrii Sarkar to accept the post of the President. 

Does it not need to clarify the distinction?


7. In the 1950s, Baba issued a circular directing Shrii Prabhat Rainjan to take over all types of Marga.

<!-- If you could remember put a little bit of strain on your memory, you will please recollect that sometimes possibly  -->

I am not in a position to give you a copy of that circular at this late stage.

<!-- So if there are some fault in my language, I may be excused) Who so?  -->

Does it not need to clarify the distinction?


8. Whether Taraka Brahma, Mahakaul, Mahasambhuti and Revered Baba Anandamurtiji are a person or a Supreme Entire or both if He is a Supreme Entity.

Where comes the question of hurting the sentiments of Baba's devotees?


9. It is the vanii of Revered Baba that:
- He had been a mystery in past
- He is a mystery for the present
- He will remain a Mystery in the future. 

If so, where comes the question of hurting the sentiments on attainment of perfection of Shri Ram Chandraji Upadhyaya and again taking birth as a Muslim fakir? 

His ways are always mysterious.


10. When Taraka Brahma becomes the Mahasambhuti, the Mahakaul and Most Revered Baba Anandamurtiji, He needs a vishes adhar (special base) in the form of a human body.

Please see revered Baba’s pravacan delivered in July 1967 at Delhi under Head Sambhuti and Mahasambhuti appearing in:

A-Bodhi Kalpa in January 1968 at Pages 11.20 Reference of vishes adhar at page 18
B-Ananda Duta of May 1971 at pages 20.29. Reference of vishes adhar svpecially at page 27.

In this pravacan, Revered Baba has said very clearly about the vishes adhar (Special base).

When Mahasambhuti definitely needs vishes adhar in human form, where comes the question of hurting the sentiment?


11. When Taraka Brahma needs vishes adhar (special base) to express Himself as Mahasambhuti, Mahakaul and Revered Baba Anandamurti, should the vishes adhar not be equally sanctified, holy suspicious, sacred and divine? 

If it is so how does it hurt the Sentiments of Margiis brothers if Shri Ram Chandraji Upadhyaya attained perfection and again came as a Muslim fakir?


12. It took several thousand years for Taraka Brahma to come as Mahasambhuti, Mahakaul and Baba Anandamurtiji.

The vishes adhar takes at least 2 lives for sadhaka siddha to become fully seasoned, sanctified, and divine to withstand the force of power energy (shakti) and effulgence of Mahasambhuti, the Revered Baba Anandamurtiji.


13. In Bodhikalpa of January 1975 at Pages 35-37 Late Acarya Shri Amitanandaji Avadhuta has given some incidents as told to him by the Revered Baba personally relating to His own self at Ananda Nagar. 

This has been published under head ‘The Unresolved Mystery’ in which he has reproduced the words of Baba.

<!-- This is an article, which in my humble opinion should not only be read and memorised but also digested and assimilated by every devotee.  -->

<!-- In one of the paragraphs of the said article the Reverend  -->

There Baba says:


{{< q a="Baba" >}}
I have gone to Jamalpur hill for doing sadhana. Someone tells me in my ears, 'Come with me. I will show you a better place for sadhana, follow me'. 

I see no one but I follow the voice whose presence I feel so clearly.

After a while, it tells me, Are you mad? Don’t, he is Maya. Are you P.R. Sarkar? See who your are! 

Then a reel of my past life, my earlier lives, flashes clearly before my eyes and I realize who I am” (Here “I” is used for Baba).
{{< /q >}}

<!--  "I have gone to Jamalpur hill for doing sadhana.” 

I am sitting at a particular place when someone tells in my ears, “come with me. I will show you a better place for sadhana. Follow me”. 

I see no one but I follow the voice whose presence I feel so clearly. The voice takes me to another place and asks me to do sadhana. After a while it tells me. “ 

Are you mad? Don’t be in Maya Are you P.R. Sarkar? See who you are! “ And a reel of my past life, my earlier lives, flashes clearly before my eyes and I realise who I am.  -->


There are several such paragraphs of interest in this article.

May this saying of Revered Baba act as healing balm for those whose sentiments I am accused of hurting.


14. In Ananda Rekha of May-June 1981, Revered Baba’s pravacan has appeared under head “Mahasambhuti vishwa men kab ate hain” (When the Mahasambhuti comes in the Universe). 

In this pravacan, Revered Baba has said:


{{< q a="Baba" >}}
When the affairs are completely out of control and sin enters into every bit of the Society ... in such circumstances Parama Purusa becomes helpless to take human body (five rudimentary form)
{{< /q >}}


Parama Purusa cannot accept the ordinary adhar. 

The adhar must be vishes (special). If so why should it hurt the sentiments?


15. At page 21 of Ananda Rekha July -August 1981 the great devotee of our most Revered Baba Shri Sahadevji has written under the head, “Vacanamrta” with reference to Shri Shyamacaran Lahiriji, that the yogi said:

"Tathastu" (Let it be so), "Pratikasha karo" (wait). 

Who was the yogi of Drongiri? Is it not a mystery? If it is so, how the Mahasambhuti or the Mahakaul came here? 

It is an incident of the year 1851. 



16. Please see at pages 19 22 of Ananda Yuga for the month of Sept. 1981.

Acarya Shri Raghunathji has written under the heading, "Mahasambhuti ka liila vilas", that the Taraka Brahma has no form and shape and He taken His form of Pancamahabhuti as per His will (svasamkalpit). 

Here it is His will and will alone according to which He takes his body. 

<!-- How will it hurt the sentiments? -->


17. The pravacan of Baba in Ananda Yuga of October 1981 under the heading, "Taraka Brahma, ka avirbhava", page 31, 33 has said that Parama Purusa, to express Himself, comes under the parameter of desh (place) kal (time) and rupa (subject).

After taking the human form, He becomes nearer to us. 

<!-- In view of this how I am responsible for hurting the feeling of my brothers? -->


18. At pages 35, 38 of Ananda Rekha for the month of September – October 1981, "Baba Ka Antaryamitva", written by a sadhaka. 

At page 38 it has appeared that revered Baba told that while doing Dharma Samiksa of His disciples, He had to perform at least 4 roles at a time:

- Shri P.R. Sarkar
- Baba
- Sadguru
- Anandamurtiji*

{{< n n="We equate this as Sarkar being the vehicle or connection to physicality, Baba being the personal relationship or connector to people, Sadguru being the teacher or connector to knowledge, and Anandamurti being the connector to Nirguna" >}}

It becomes really very difficult to make adjustments in all the 4 roles. Baba had to perform the liila of Kalyanasundaram and Rudrah. 

All the four are so intermingled with one another that it is very difficult to make any distinction.

I conclude that all the 4 roles of Baba are one and the same force.


19. At Page 19 of Ananda Yuga for the for the month of October-November-December 1982, at times it appeared that the Reverend Baba brought His right foot between both His palms and said twice, “I am perfectly alright”. 

It is a mystery for me till today as to who was catching whose foot, and so to whom He was addressing and speaking? 

<!-- I shall be highly grateful if the brothers whose sentiments I hurt, of course unknowingly, clarify this mystery to me. -->

20) At page 15 of Ananda Yuga for the month of March-April 1983, Baba commanded to His own Self, saying:

{{< q a="Baba" >}}
Prabhat Rainjan Sarkar! You regain your health for sometime as you have to go to the field”. 
{{< /q >}}

This is again a mystery for me as to who was that super Entity to command Shri Prabhat Rainjan (Reverend Baba) to go to the field.

It did not take even a moment for the lifeless body of Shri Sarkar to obey and comply with the order. 

<!-- It would really be a great kindness to me to clarify as to  -->

Who commanded whom?*

{{< n n="Anandamurti commanded Sarkar" >}}


21. At page 24 of Ananda Yuga for the month of May-June 1983, it has appeared that “at times Baba had to take 2 different bodies on the same day to protect His disciple”. 

Definitely it is a very ordinary liila for Reverend Baba.

In view of this what difference does it take if Shri Ram Chandraji Upadhyaya attained perfection with the body and also took the body of a Muslim fakir in next life? 

<!-- How does it hurt the sentiments? -->

22. The Taraka Brahma as Mahasambhuti has always been addressed by Rishis, Maharishis and Vedas as limitless (neti neti).

Has He now come under limitations and become knowable?

<!-- I am sorry the letter has become very lengthy and hence I stop giving further reference 

With Baba Nam Kevalam
I am ever yours -->
