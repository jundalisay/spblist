Whilst Baba started taking His samkalpa sitting in padmasana (lotus posture),
we remained seated at His feet. Now, we were all feeling as if life was coming back to
us.

After taking His samkalpa Baba sat silently and we began to massage His body
and feet.

Baba said, ”Nagina, I had taken out seven-eighths of the pranah from my body,
the body is therefore somewhat weak”.

After about twenty or twenty-five minutes more, Baba said, “Nagina if you
cannot bring me water very soon, it will be difficult to retain this body despite the
samkalpa”.

Now, we were worried as to from where we could get water in this desolate
place. My eyes fell on a light in a railway officer's quarter which was about a furlong or
two away. I asked Harivansha Jha who was one of the younger brother disciples there
and an officer in my department, to rush to the lighted house and fetch water from
there.

Harivansha Jha somehow ran in the dark and reached the house. As he climbed the stairs to the veranda,a largeGerman Shepherd dog jumped at him. He thought quickly and crouched down and the dog jumped over him. By that time, the owner of the house came out and he controlled the dog.
By now my Harivansha Jha was panting heavily for two reasons, one as he had
run all the way and second because of the dog. Before the owner could ask a single
question, he blurted out, "Give me some water!"

The owner went in and came out with some water in a silver tumbler. Shri Jhaji took it and without speaking a word to the owner, ran from the house. The owner was struck dumb with surprise.

In this interval, Baba had asked for water several times. His throat and mouth was dry with thirst and when He tried to speak, only a “chat chat” sound emerged His throat.

The longer we waited for water, the more restless Bab became, and we were also feeling very desperate. Feeling that perhaps the first person had not been able to obtain water, I asked another Shri Harisadhanji, also one of the younger brother disciples, to run to the road that leads to the church. 

I told him, At the crossroads there is sweet shop and I have seen a container of water there. Bring water from there". He too now ran on this desperate errand in search of water.
Baba again asked for water.I, said "Baba those who have gone to fetch water have not yet returned, I have
heard that thirst can be controlled through mantra also, kindly use that device for the
time being."

Baba said, "I have already applied that device and it is not possible to do it any further. If someone else applies the mantra, it will be more effective." 


I said, “Baba, we do not know the mantra and its use. You have not taught this
to us. What is to be done?”

Baba said, "I shall give you the mantra right now. Repeat it just now and apply it on me" The mantra is “Vambhasi tattvam idam tistha”. 

I no longer recall the number of times that Baba asked me to repeat it, but I completed the japa as He directed and told Baba when it has been completed.

Then Baba said, "Touch my vishuddha cakra with your little finger and keeping the finger there repeat this mantra thrice". 

I did as directed. Baba was now somewhat steady and said, "Nagina you can keep me without water with the help of this for half an hour. After half an hour the effect of this mantra will be over. By thenyou must arrange for water. You can use this mantra at the most up to three times."

Baba seemed a little recovered and we also relaxed a little.

While sitting at His feet, I podered, “By whose imagination alone, unnumbered creations came into being and by whose idea this whole universe is sustained and whose slight turn of mood can annhilate this whole universe, that Almighty is today desiring some water to quench His thirst!” I was bemused by this thought and said to myself, “O Lord Great is your play (Liila)".


Again I began to think of Shri Jitendra Jha who had gone to fetch water and was anxiously looking in the direction in which he had run to fetch water. I was eagerly awaiting the water when I heard the sound of running footsteps and soon he approached us. He was panting heavily and whilst running the half the water had spilled from the tumbler. Anyway, I gave what remained to Baba, and after drinking it Baba became more normal.

After some time, Harisadhanji returned bringing a big glass of water. I gave that water to Baba also, and after this He seemed completely restored. 

By now, it was about ten or half past ten in the night, but Baba was still sitting on the grave. After sometime again, we gave water to Baba to drink and requested Him to return.

Because I was insistent on Baba’s returning, Baba explained that he had taken out about 7/8 of His pranah outside His body His joints were not yet revived and He was as yet unable to stand or walk.


I said, "Baba give some time, I shall run to bring the car here and take you to your house in convenience.

Baba said 'Nagina." Walking is the remedy for this condition. The other alternative is to go into nirvikalpa samadhi. But, I do not want to go into nirvikalpa asthere will be no desire to return to the body again and I have already taken a samkalpa for retaining the body. Therefore, walking is now the only alternative. 

As I had removed a major portion of the pranah from the body, to establish perfect adjustment between
mind, pranah and body will now take about one month's time.”

I humbly suggested that through the use of mantra also, pranah could be circulated through the joints.

Baba said,”Yes, but it would be better to wait and see for some time more.”

For sometime Baba sat silently and we continued to massage Him.

Baba then put His right foot on the ground and told us, “You all touch the toe of my foot.”

We did as directed and Baba blessed us most mercifully. That day, He blessed us in a most wonderful and strange manner and the blessing itself was quite long. 

Baba’s blessing was in Samskrta, so I do not remember it fully. I only recollect the last
portion, “Be blessed with the greatest glory”.

After blessing us Baba again sat silently, I waited for some more time, but when it was getting late, I requested again that for bringing pranah to the joints let there be the use of mantra.
Baba said, ”Yes, now I shall have to apply the power of mantra.”

Then Baba very kindly applied mantra on every joint of His body whilst we all
sat and watched.

After applying the mantra in this way, Baba slowly stood up and began to walk
extremely slowly. We also began to walk on both sides and behind.
Meanwhile I told my brother disciples to return the tumblers and to then meet us
on the way. As we approached Baba's house, He gave us leave and wanted to walk on
alone, but on our insistence, He permitted one disciple, Shri Harisadhanji, to
accompany Him up to His residence.

I was waiting for Harisadhanji at Bindeshwariji’s, where I was staying and he
came and informed me that Baba that Baba had got home safely , though in a weak
condition.

There are many myths and stories prevalent about this incident of Baba desiring to give up His body. I hope that these lines will remove all false impressions
and present the true picture before the readers.
