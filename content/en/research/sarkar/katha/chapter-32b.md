During training I used to see everyone smoking. This urged me to start smoking again.

I had given up smoking after the punishment that Baba had given me. But this desire began to grow in this company.

The more I tried to suppress it, the stronger it became. 

This continued for days until felt that it could no longer be suppressed.

Whenever this desire became strong, I would always pray to Baba that he may protect my helpless self from resuming smoking. But all my prayers failed. 

I thought many times that I should buy cigarettes and stealthily smoke. But if I began this habit again, then it will never die. 

<!-- I had given it up only after punishment from Baba on this score Many arguments for and against would come to my mind in regard to smoking but all arguments appeared to fail before the strength of my desire.  -->

Sometimes when I saw someone smoking a cigarette, I felt like borrowing one from him to smoke. But my shyness prevented my from doing so.

<!-- After continuous suppression of this desire, extremely ugly ideas began to creep in my mind. I felt like picking up a stub and smoking it. 

These thoughts filled me with self-loathing and condemnation. 

In spite of such severe struggle in the mind, it appeared that some power was creating the right type of ideas and arguments in my mind to enable me to withstand my rising powerful desire. -->

One day I asked for a cigarette from my friend devout Muslim friend from Bihar who used to smoke. 

<!-- He knew the circumstances under which I had given up smoking, and so he asked what I would do with a cigarette. I said I would smoke.

He looked at me in surprise and said, “ What are you saying?” 

I told him that I was serious about starting smoking again. -->

He now began to plead, “You have given up smoking as a result of a vow taken by you after your guru punished you. How then are you thinking like this? Please try to keep your vow.”


In spite of my insistent request he did not give me a cigarette. Now I began to
keep all my money with him so that I could not buy cigarettes. Whenever I asked for
money from him, in a very gentle and cultured way he would first ascertain my needs
and would supply me with these things immediately. 

But he never allowed me to handle cash. Now he became extra cautious that I might not buy and smoke cigarettes. 

He became so alert that he informed other trainees also that I should never smoke.

Many times I tried to buy cigarettes. But every time, some unknown power created some obstacle and I had to give up my plans. 

One day oppressed by intense desires I beseeched Baba that He may kindly help me from descending into hell again.

Baba miraculously graced me and the desire to smoke ended forever.

After a lot of mental clash I realised that on the one hand Baba was aggravating my desire like a homeopathic medicine dose and on the other hand He was the unseen person who helped me to overcome my temptation. 

Not only this, He had inspired my companion to watch me cautiously and through this medium was reminding me of my vow and was again educating me in this regard. Great is the liila of the Lord and great are His ways of saving His disciples from a fall.

<!-- Now and then I remember these graces of Baba and remain absorbed in His thought for hours.
My prayer is, “Oh Lord, protect me like this always and whenever I stagger or
fall, support me to get up and walk again.” -->

<!-- Salutations to Baba the First Vibrational Principle Who Is
Highly Respectable -->
