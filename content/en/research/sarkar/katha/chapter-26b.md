The 27 December 1959 proved to be the most auspicious and fortunate day in the life of Ram Bahadurji, when Baba paid another surprise visit to him. 

This time Baba did not stay long at Barhi. Even so both husband and wife were overwhelmed by
Baba’s Grace.

Whilst at Ram Bahadurji’s residence, Baba asked for paper and pen. Ram
Bahadurji rushed to get paper and pen and placed them before Baba. Then Baba jotted
down His blessings in the following manner:

"As a soldier you most not search for worldly pleasure or comfort. Be
ready for all sorts of sufferings. Let suffering be your asset. Suffering will help
you in establishing the Sadvipra Raj. You must not argue, you must not think
twice, you should “do or die”. I do not want to see the face of a defeated son in
flesh and blood”.

Barahi
affectionately
27.12.59
Yours
Baba 

All the members of the family of Ram Bahadurji were overjoyed having had Baba’s darshan and having received his blessing. While describing this unbounded grace and kindness of Baba, Ram Bahadurji becomes so sentimental that he moves even the stony hearts to devotion and faith. How fortunate are Ram Bahadurji and his wife.

Only a few days must have passed when Baba’s car again reached in front of
Shri Ram Bahadurji’s house and the Lord called Ram Bahadurji. Shri Ram Bahadur,
his wife and children all ran and came and fell at Baba’s feet.Really fortunate is this family that the lord comes Himself again and again to give them darshan. This was the third such fortunate occasion. This time Baba remained in His car, gave blessings to him and the members of his family and resumed his journey towards place where he was going.

Seeing the simplicity and the pure hearts of this family. Baba graced them with still greater proximity and Shri Ram Bahadurji was transferred to Jamalpur. He remained in Jamalpur for nearly three years as D.S.P. in the Bihar Military Police.

There he had Baba’s darshan every day and accompanied him on his evening walks.

He would join all he D.M.C. that were held in the neighborhood. After his official duties most of his time was spent in devotional mood and activities. 

In the meanwhile his wife fell ill and was bedridden for nearly eight months. The disease took a dangerous turn and his wife remained unconscious for nearly 3 days.

After she regained consciousness she informed that during the period of unconsciousness she was feeling that two sadhus in matted hair were constantly sitting besides her and giving her solace all the time. By the grace of Baba she regained her health.

It appeared that Baba brought them to Jamalpur so that his wife’s illness may not become out of control. While describing her illness the wife of Ram Bahadurji said in a voice full of devotion, that she survived that serious illness only through the grace of Baba.

Shri Ram Bahadurji meanwhile was having Baba’s darshan everyday and bathing happily in the flow of the Ganges of Devotion of Baba. 

His main occupation was always singing the glory of Baba’s name and qualities. For the very beginning he was fond of three things: sentient food, mediation and devotion. 

I have already mentioned about the excellence of his devotion. Now I shall refer to some of his other traits. He was always fond of good cooking. Good cooking, good food and enjoyed taking heavy meals.

During his stay in Jamalpur he participated enthusiastically in the function of Ananda Purnima. There was also a programme of collective feast amongst the celebrations. His entire enthusiasm was concentrated on items of the feast and food.

Shri Ram Bahadurji kept on leaving the company of Baba to look after the arrangements of cooking and the feast. 

Omniscient Baba knew about it and Baba gave him a new name. This is so suitable and true to his nature. Baba called him. ‘Shrii Bhojanand’ (one who relishes his food). 

At this everyone present laughed heartily and since then old Margiis knew him only as Shri Bhojanandji.

In bringing about a devotional mood, songs, kiirtan and dance are always very helpful. Therefore Shri Bhojanandji is extremely fond of devotional songs, kiirtan and dance When he starts singing like Narada in his own tune, rhythm and voice, all the arts of music, including tunes, meters rhythms fall on the wayside. 

These arts are afraid, lest he should grasp them forever. Even so, unmindful of all of them, be enjoys
his devotional songs and kiirtan. There is no fixed tune for his singing and kiirtan. He bursts into them at his own sweet will and continues as long as his mood lasts. 

Due to the grace and contact with Baba, he became quite prosperous and was transferred to Dhanbad. There he did yeoman’s work to spread the philosophy and idealism of the mission and in the month of October 1968 with the help of local Margiis and after obtaining Baba’s permission he arranged DMG at Dhanbad.

### DHANBAD DMC

This DMC was most successful. He had made preparation for taking out, agrand procession. However, it began to rain just when the procession was to start. 

Shri Ram Bahadurji prayed to Baba that he might be pleased and bless so that the procession may be takeout. Rev. Baba was happy and conceded his request. 

The rains stopped and the Margiis took out the procession with great enthusiasm. Mrs. Ram Bahadur Singh was in charge of making arrangements for Baba’s food and she dedicated herself fully to this task. Baba told them after his evening walk.

That he has gone to their residence and looked at it from outside and come back. How kind and graceful in Baba and how fortunate are Mr. and Mrs. Ram Bahadurji whom Baba has granted such devotion and faith.


### BABA LISTENS TO THE PRAYERS OF RAM BAHADURJI THE GREAT DEVOTEE

Only recently on 27 December 1981 I was going to Ananda Nagar, for the DMC along with my family. Shri Ram Bahadur was also travelling by the same train along with his family. Our train was more than eight hours late and so we missed the connection in Dhandbad. We decided to hire a tax but as we discovered, neither the taxi driver nor we knew the way.

At about six in the evening our taxi reached the Chas police post and the taxi driver and the owner were not prepared to go any further that night. The night was dark and the way was unknown. The unmetalled road passed through a dense forest. Our
difficulty was that ladies and children were with us and there was so place where we could stay.

Under the circumstances, it seemed that pressing on and reaching Ananda Nagar somehow, was the only course open to us. Even the police officers requested the taxi-driver to proceed, but he was adamant. Feeling completely helpless, I requested Shri Ram Bahadurji to pray for Baba’s help. At first he made several excuses, but when I reminded him about the saying of the great saint Vyaas, who wrote the Mahabharat and many Puranas:

“There are two truths embedded in the eighteen Puranas-one is that virtue
means helping the needy and vice means causing pain to others”.

I asked him to help us in our hour of need by asking Baba for help. Looking at our difficulties he fell silent for sometime and remembered Baba and asked Him to remove our difficulty. And lo, a miracle happened in a few minutes. Three persons on a
motorcycle reached the spot where we were, and enquired what the trouble was, while
we and the policemen were talking to the taxi-man.

“What is the trouble?” they enquired.

Shri Ram Bahadur pointed out that we were going to Ananda Nagar, but due to our ignorance about the way, the night being dark and the road being irregular and passing through a forest, the taxi-driver was not prepared to move forward.


The riders on the motor cycle said, “We too are going to Ananda Nagar” and they asked the driver to follow them without any worry.

The driver pleaded that he might lose his way on the way back but the riders on
the motorcycle informed him that they were coming from Dhanbad as contractors to
erect the pandal at Ananda Nagar. 

Their truck with the goods had gone ahead and when they reach Ananda Nagar, the truck would return to Dhanbad. They suggested
that the taxi might return with the truck from Ananda Nagar to Dhanbad.Now the driver was left with no excuse and when the police officers pressed him further, he had to carry us to Ananda Nagar. From there for the entire way, Shri
Ram Bahadur continued to sing ‘Baba Nam Kevalam’. 

We reached Ananda Nagar at about 8:30pm. 

This was the result of Shri Ram Bahadurji's deep devotion for Baba that we reached Ananda Nagar safety that evening. Great is Baba and blessed is Shri Ram Bahadurji and his devotion to Baba that his messengers on
the motorcycle solved our difficulty.

My acquaintance with the family of Shri Ram Bahadurji is an old one. This time when we were returning from the Jan. 82 DMC Shri Ram Bahadurji and his wife were kind enough to relate these experience to me. All the events are connected with Baba
and inspiring for the Sadhakas. 

I have, therefore, mentioned them here after taking his permission. He had many more such experience and I have requested him that he should put them in black and white for inclusion in Ananda Kathas. He has agreed to
do so. Let us see when be kindly does it.

It is a matter of great sorrow that on 29 December 1982 suddenly after doing
his pancajanya, Shri Ram Bahadurji left his body for his heavenly abode. It is my
prayer with Baba that his soul may rest in eternal peace and salvation.
