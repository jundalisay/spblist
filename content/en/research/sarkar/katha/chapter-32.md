While under training in Delhi, we had to go in groups to factories producing different types of materials in the states of Delhi, Punjab, Harayana and Uttar Pradesh for practical training.

During these tours, we also had opportunities to visit places of tourist interest such as Kuruksetra.

The Birla Mandir is located on the bank of the holy Kuruksetra tank. In front, there is a hand pump, with sweet, cool water. 

We reached there by 2PM, much oppressed by the summer heat. After washing our hands, feet and face in that cool water, we felt relaxed and regained our happy and joyful mood.

On the left of this temple there is a mighty carved chariot with 4 full sized horses.
- On the chariot are seated Krsna as the driver, and Arjuna with his famous Gandiva bow.
- The chariot, horses Arjuna and Krsna have been carved of one huge marble. 

Inside the temple, the image of Shri Krishna is worshipped.
- The walls are inscribed with all the verses of the Giita. 

<!-- All these things are extremely beautiful and the whole surroundings are very attracting. -->

The trainees were looking at the beauties of the temple in different groups.

Some people began to worship the image of Krsna in the temple.

I was reading the verses on the walls and looking at the paintings and pictures.

I suddenly noticed that a dark complexioned farmer of middle age trying to decipher something on the wall. 

He had only a dhoti on and his upper body was bare. 

I stopped behind him to see what he was reading. He asked me with tearful eyes to read out what was written there. 

It said, “In whichever form they worship Me, I appear to them in that very form.”

As I read out this line, he began to cry loudly, “Krsna Krsna!”

I said, “It is not necessary to call like this. Will He hear only your loud cries? If you have to make Him hear, then you have to call Him from the bottom of your heart. He has to be called only in the way in which He has taught us to call Him. He understands the language of the heart only.”

As I said this he embraced me and began to cry loudly, “Krsna! Krsna!”

I remembered Baba mentally and asked what I should do. 

Seeing that man embracing me, other trainees, rushed towards me and tried to pull him away. One of the trainees who was a Muslim from Bihar told our friends not to disturb us, as it appeared that both of us belonged to the same sect.

When my trainee friends moved a little away from me that gentleman asked me how he would be able to meet Krsna. 

All my friends took him to be mad and began to watch that no harm came to me. That person was full of devotion. 

He lost consciousness of his body and mind and continued to insist again and again that I should help him to meet Krsna.

I was wondering mentally whether another Bindeshwariji has appeared before me in another form!

This person was also adamant like Bindeshwariji of Jamalpur. Has Baba ordained that I should always serve this type of personality?

Time and place were not favorable to explain the practical side of meditation.

So I prayed to Baba in my mind that He should rescue me from this situation. 

It took a lot of time to console and explain things to that gentleman. 

I could not see much of the place and temple. Meanwhile the other trainees and the Principal boarded the bus and began to wait for me. But this gentleman was not prepared to leave me. 

He came with me up to the bus and asked me to show him the way to meet Krsna.

I again thought of Baba and told that man:

“Repeat His name from the bottom of your heart. How can Krsna help but to meet you, if while waking, sleeping, sitting rising, or walking you should continue to repeat His name? This will certainly work.”

As I said this, he let me go and saw me off with a heavy heart. He continued to look at my bus until it was out of sight.

<!-- I do not know who in the form of this devotee was sent to me. Great and strange is Baba’s liila.  

I continued to recall that devoted man throughout my trip and so also I thought of Baba again and again. This trip was thus highly enjoyable.

That man’s devotion and keenness to meet Krsna was so great that Baba must have certainly showed Himself to him in some form or other. This is my firm belief.  -->


I was fortunate in having another singular trip to Mathura. It was the time of swing festival. 

Devotees would place the idol of Krsna on a swing or jhula and would give him gentle swings. 

Mathura is the birthplace of Krsna. But in visiting the sites of this place, I did not feel any special vibrations. This was most surprising. 

I inquired from Pandas there about that prison where Krsna was born.

One of the Pandas took me to a place that according to him was the birthplace of Krsna. I stayed there for some time and thought of Krsna, but felt no vibration at all. 

Consequently I returned rather disappointed from there. 

Afterwards when I was seated at Baba’s feet in Jamalpur, I referred to my experiences in Mathura. 


{{< l a="Baba" >}}
All places connected with the birth of Krsna are now under the Yamuna River. That is why you did not feel the vibrations there.

<!-- Now I understood why the holy place of Krsna’s birth became tasteless for me.  -->

Baba further pointed out that there are some places connected with Krsna in Gokul and Vrindavan.
