## Causes

It is not always the case that sugar is present in the urine of diabetes patients. Diabetes with sugar in the urine is called “somaroga” or “madhumeha”. 

Diabetes without sugar is called “mútrátisára” or “udakameha”.

The debility of the Mańipura Cakra is the main cause of diabetes.

Amongst the pancreatic juices:
- one secretion helps in the digestion of food
- another separates the sugar content from non-vegetarian and starchy types of food

Sugar is then stored in a section of the liver.

According to body requirements, it is dissolved to generate heat and vital power to run the body mechanism. 

The vitality of the liver is weakened by:
- chronic indigestion
- constipation where  the stool usually turns into pellets
- mental exertion without any physical labour
- use of intoxicants
- excessive seminal waste

When such weakening takes place, the sugar contents of the food fails to find a storage place in the liver. And so they are assimilated into the blood and gradually accumulate. 

As a result, the blood gets polluted and greatly loses its immune properties.

The body's natural reaction is to try to purify the blood by:
- separating out its sugar content and
- expelling it with the urine. 

To dissolve the sugar, the human body needs plenty of water.

This is why diabetes patients suffer from a continuous thirst.

The sugar emitted with the urine in a large quantity gradually reduces the vital energy of diabetes patients.

## Diet

Diabetes is basically a disease of liver and pancreas. 

These organs should be kept in a healthy state.

Patients must select food that will keep their bowels clear, yet which is nutritious and easily digestible. 

All types of fruits are good for this disease, especially ripe bananas. 

Non-vegetarian food must never be eaten.

Vegetable proteins are also acidic, hence they are to be eaten as sparingly as possible. 

<!-- It is therefore advisable to reduce the intake of  -->

Rice and rut́i (made of wheat flour) should therefore be reduced. 

More foods such as vegetable soup, plantain soup, pat́ol, okra, dhundula, paltá, squash (Lagenaria vulgaris Seringe), plantain spathes and flowers, figs, etc. should be eaten as they contain alkaline properties.


## Dos and don’ts

Diabetes is the disease of intellectuals. Those who do physical labour seldom suffer from this disease.

Diabetes is caused by:
- mental exertion
- remaining indoors for a long period
- physical laziness
- constipation
- intemperance, etc.

Only those foods to be eated are those which do not over-stimulate the liver and pancreas.

Similarly, work and exercise which will help to bring these organs into their normal state of health must be pursued more and more. 

For those who are adverse to physical labour, a cure from diabetes is next to impossible.

The human body also needs the nutrients offered by starchy and non-vegetarian types of food. 

Therefore, alkaline foods which contain those nutrients should be taken in greater quantity to meet those needs:
- coconut
- peanuts
- curd (yogurt)
- bananas, etc.

A drink of peanut extract and water without sugar and with little or no honey is ideal as both food and medicine for this disease.

Insulin may increase the vitality of a patient but can never cure the disease.

Generally, diabetes patients are a bit greedy. Sometimes, they eat too much sweetened food which brings on the disease. 

Diabetes patients:
- must keep control over such temptations and
- should practise fasting.

In the severe state, a continuous fast for 2-3 days taking only a little lemon juice or other fruit will definitely reduce the urine's sugar content.

Sometimes, sugar is completely absent in the urine. In this respect one has to remember that sugar may be found temporarily in the urine if the urinary bladder, kidney or some other internal organ is subjected to a blow. 

If in such cases insulin is given, it will actually harm the patient. The best thing to do would be to treat the injury of the concerned organ appropriately, and then the urine of the patient will automatically become sugar-free.
