Dhyána attracts many positive microvita. Negative microvita can only be controlled by positive microvita. 

**The positive microvita eat the negative microvita. This is the reason why the disease is cured.** 

Jaundice is a disease caused by negative microvita. If dhyána is practised perfectly, the disease will be cured very quickly.
