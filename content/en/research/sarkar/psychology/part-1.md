Spiritualism and spirituality are different. 
- “Spiritualism” means something which concerns ghosts
- “Spirituality” concerns the Supreme Cognitive Principle. 

All actions must have a base, a starting-point whether those actions are:
- intellectual
- intuitional
- purely psychic

All actions must also have a goal – a Supreme Desideratum. 

For this cult of spirituality, the base is morality. Without morality, nothing can be done.

Morality concerns 2 types of waves:

1. Mental-physical emanations: This is Yama
2. Physico-mental waves and movement: This is Niyama

One should keep:
- proper control of mental-physical emanations. 
- proper adjustment in physico-mental movement, between:
  - the external world and the internal world
  - external physicality and the internal subjective world. 

The goal is the attainment of that supreme stance where there will be justice and fair play for all inanimate and animate beings.

<!-- Práńáh yathátmano’bhiiśt́áh bhútánám api te tathá;
Atmaopamyena bhútánám dayáḿ kurvanti sádhavah.
[Just as my life is dear to me, similarly the life of another creature is dear to it. Every entity loves its own existence. In the light of this truth, evolved human beings feel mercy for each and every object of this creation.] -->

This sort of remembrance is called sádhu dharma or Bhágavata dharma. The person who practises this cult is a true sádhu [renunciant]. 

There must not be any gap between your thinking and your actions.
- If there is any gap, that gap should be minimized step by step.

 <!-- Finally, thought and action should coincide.  -->


Preaching disparity amongst human beings or living beings is not morality. 

The supreme equality, the supreme spiritual stance, cannot be achieved where there is any thought of disparity. 

So at the very start, one must practise these two types of morality and become one with them.
- Morality is the base
- The supreme stance is the goal

Morality propels the microcosms towards Him without break or pause. 

The Supreme Consciousness is attracting all entities towards Himself. This is why in Sanskrit He is called “Krśńa”. One of the meanings of the word krśńa is “one who attracts”. Another meaning is “the entity on whom the existence of other entities depends”.

Thus, on the one hand, The Supreme Consciousness is attracting the spiritual aspirants to move ahead
- On the other hand, the spiritual aspirants, through their own efforts, their own moral force, are also moving towards Him. 

Because of these sources of impetus, human beings arrive at their destination. 

If some people feel that The Supreme Consciousness is not sympathetic or gracious towards them, that He is not attracting them, in that case I will advise them to become more established in morality. Then they will instantly feel the grace of Parama Puruśa, because it is through their own moral force that they will move forward. 

Parama Puruśa does His duty of attracting them. They have their own duty to move towards the goal. 

Let the sádhakas [spiritual aspirants] do their duty, and let The Supreme Consciousness do His.

Then, the physical body should be sanctified by:
- good thoughts
- good actions
- good food
- physical practices that affect the nerve fibres of the body

This is because the first phase of realization comes through the nerve fibres, the afferent and efferent nerves. 

The highest realization does not depend on the nerve cells and nerve fibres, but for this also good food and self-restraint are necessary.

You should eat only that sort of food which will have a beneficial influence on your body, mind and spirit.

<!--  It is not proper for human beings to eat simply whatever is available, nor is it proper for animals either.  -->

<!-- Animals do indeed discriminate between food items. In this regard,  -->

Lord Shiva said:

<!-- Phaliśyatiiti vishvásah siddherprathama lakśańam;
Dvitiiyaḿ shraddhayá yuktaḿ trtiiyaḿ gurupújanam.
Caturtho samatábhávo paiṋcamendriyanigrahah;
Śaśt́haiṋca pramitáháro saptamaḿ naeva vidyate.(1) -->

There are 7 requirements for success in any mission:

1. Firm determination: “I must succeed”
2. Reverence
3. Guru pújá, or constant remembrance of one’s spiritual master
4. Equanimity of mind
5. Control of the senses
6. Balanced diet
7. There is no seventh requirement.

This sanctification and purification of the body through proper food and proper behaviour and various practices should be complemented by certain other practices to create a perfect adjustment in the body amongst the glands, sub-glands and their hormonal secretions. 

The propensities of living structures are both directly and indirectly controlled by the secretions of hormones from different glands and sub-glands located near different plexi of the corporal structure.

Nowadays everywhere, there is wastage of human psychic potentiality. 

The psychic potentialities of human beings are immense, but people do not utilize them because most of their valuable time is wasted in undesirable thoughts, in psychic extravaganza. 

If human life is 60 years, 20 years is spent in sleep. The remaining 40 years are wasted in petty or useless activities. 

<!-- How much time do people really get to devote to worthwhile tasks? -->

This psychic extravaganza should be checked either by physical approach, or psychic approach, or by spirituo-psychic approach. 

People should have some control over their breathing, over their respiratory system, because the waves of respiration control the waves of thinking. 

Whenever you are doing something crude, your respiration becomes very active; and when you are thinking of something subtle, it becomes slow, extremely slow.

Finally, when this respiration coincides, or becomes one, with one’s thought-waves, that stage is known as hat́ha yoga samádhi. That is, the physical exertions, the physical emanations, become one with the psychic emanations. 

So some degree of control over respiration is essential.

The scope of rationality and rationalization should be increased more and more, and for this, unnecessary waves should be removed from the plane of physicality. From the psychic sphere also, unnecessary waves are to be removed. 

This will remove many burdens from the mind. “I must not bother about petty things, because that will waste my time” – people should remember this. This removal or rather withdrawal of unnecessary and undesirable thoughts emanated from the mind will help you in rationalizing the major portion of your mental faculty, so this must also be practised. The cult of spirituality is a cult of pinnacled order.
