Yesterday evening I criticized a worker, even though other workers were 
also present. Afterward I regretted my behavior. While falling asleep, I pleaded 
to Baba to free me from this sort of nasty psychological tendency. 

Toward morning, I had a dream: 

A Margi sister committed an error. In front of others, I chided her 
repeatedly for her mistake. Eventually I lifted a stick, and, while still 
reproaching her, softly beat her on the head. She was thoroughly embarrassed. 

From behind a curtain I heard Baba's voice calling to her to come 
immediately. She left me and walked over to Baba. I felt very bad about what I 
had done. 

After a few minutes she returned. I asked her, "What did Baba say to you?" 

"He was angry with me," she said, "because I silently tolerated your public 
criticism of me." 

Before I could ask her anything more, Baba again called her out of the 
room. And I woke up. 



I had a long dream about Baba, but the beginning of it remains clearest: 

I was in a room with other workers. Baba appeared at the door and entered. 
I wanted to prostrate before Him. but as no one else did so, I refrained. A few 
moments passed as He walked through the room. 

I am late in offering sastaung pranam (prostration), I thought. M aybe it's no 
longer proper to do.... But devotion knows no time. Then and there I performed 
prostration. 

Baba gave me a beautiful smile, which made me thinkâ€” The delay had no 
importance for H im. Rather it was spiritually perfect. 

After undue hesitation, why should we hesitate even more? 

Spirituality for all 

Regular classes started for thirty mentally handicapped women. 87 They 
suffer from Downs syndrome and autism. We are teaching them yoga postures, kiirtan. and a little meditation. Though some people have expressed doubt that such people could respond to yoga, many of the women were clearly interested during the class.

87 As it turned out, almost all of them became positively enthusiastic. In general, mentally 
disadvantaged people love guided gentle movement which does not require too 
much coordination. At the same time, the hormonal balance of their glands improves, making 
them physically and mentally calmer. Some of them even enjoy the deep silence of meditation. 
Permanent results of course take time to achieve. 


Four months later. As it turned out, almost all of them became positively 
enthusiastic. In general, mentally disadvantaged people love guided gentle 
movement which does not require too much coordination. At the same time, the 
hormonal balance of their glands improves, making them physically and 
mentally calmer. Some of them even enjoy the deep silence of meditation. 
Permanent results of course take time to achieve. 

Good inspires, bad strengthens 

Calcutta. I was standing in the middle of the main downstairs room of 
Baba's house in Lake Gardens, surrounded by scores of workers and Margis, 
when one of my higher authorities. Dada M, walked in. Baba had been angry 
with him for not arranging a series of lectures for the Margis. Since Dada 
considered this my duty, now he was angry with me. This was a surprise for me. 
He shouted at me in such a voice that all the others in the room stopped their 
conversations, and turned to look at me. I saw no value in arguing, so without 
reacting or becoming nervous, I simply replied again and again, "Yes, Dada... 
Yes, Dada 

After a minute or two, he ran out of steam, and left in a huff. 

Immediately two Central workers approached me, and one said, 
"Dharmavedananda, I didn't know that you were such a seasoned worker." 

"What do you mean, Dada?" I said. 

"M yelled at you in such a way that it would have embarrassed even an 
elephant. But you took it as cool as a cucumber." 

I smiled. "Well. The credit doesn't go to me. It belongs to another higher 
authority I had for one and a half years. He constantly berated me and hounded 
me to the point that my nervous system can now stand just about anything." 

We laughed together, and I added. "It's the beauty of Tantra, you know, 
that we can benefit from every situation. The good moments inspire us, and the 
so-called bad moments strengthen us." 

Soup kitchen started for homeless people in the Shinjuku area. Today we 
served 50 people, almost all of them men. During the program we were 
approached by two Christians who told us they had the responsibility to check 
if any of these people require medical attention. They requested us to inform 
them whenever we encounter such cases, because they are only able to check 
every two or three months, and it often happens that people suffer immensely 
or die in between these visits. Though the government allocates a reasonable 
amount of money to help disadvantaged people like the physically and 
mentally handicapped, the homeless people are neglected. They are considered 
an embarrassment, and both the public and the authorities tend to ignore them. 

Most people are surprised to hear that there are a few thousand homeless 
people in Japan. Almost everyone believes that the homeless are irresponsible, 
lazy alcoholics. Even some of the Margis think so. But the truth is far different. 
Most, or perhaps all of them had great suffering when they lived within the 
normal society. They were rejected or abused, and then in most cases became 
sick. We found them on the whole to be gentle and polite. Though drinking is 
common, few of them are alcoholics. It is presently beyond our capacity to 
establish a permanent center for the homeless, but at least we must find out 
their direst needs, and not allow them to suffer unduly. 88 


88 Over the years that followed, our volunteers probably did save the lives of at least a few very 
ill people who we took to the hospital.
