On the Greyhound bus north. I'm traveling to Chicago. From Chicago I'll go to India to meet Baba and try to find out whether or not I should become an acharya 13 . The Jackson center is now in the hands of another volunteer. 

Chicago. One week later. My sister's getting married this week. The 
ceremony will be at our house, and scores of near and distant family members 
are either here or on their way. 


13 Acharya is the formal title of the teachers of Ananda M arga—the Dadas and Didis. Acharan 
means conduct. Acharya means one who teaches others through his or her personal conduct. 


Yesterday, two of my cousins and I went to a public meeting of an Indian spiritual movement just starting in America. The main attraction was the mother of the guru, together with the two leading teachers of the movement— all of whom are supposed to be living saints. The guru is still in India. 

The lecture had already started when we arrived. We slipped in at the back of the room, which was packed with about 200 people. The teacher who was lecturing turned toward me and stared. He kept his eyes fixed on me even while singing. 

But was he really looking at me? To find out, I moved to other sides of the hall. 

His eyes remained glued on me until the end—about one hour. 

When the lecture finished, I was curious, to say the least. About 10 disciples were there, and it seemed all had noticed the teacher staring at me. 

They also seemed to be wondering why. I requested an interview. 

The teacher said to me, "We are leaving Chicago just now. Come to the airport, and we will talk there." 

Together with several disciples, my cousins and I drove to the airport. After 
checking in. the two teachers and the mother took me aside, alone. 

"Who are you?" they asked. 

"I'm going to India in a few days. I'm an Ananda Margi." 

They laughed uproariously. I was shocked. 

"Oh, Ananda Marga! Violent, dangerous people! You must have nothing to 
do with them." 

I asked for the source of their malicious information. They spoke of various 
so-called scandals, but added nothing convincing. 

Then they said, "Whether you believe in Ananda Marga doesn't matter. The 
important fact is we give you Cosmic Knowledge instantly. You will see Light 
and hear Music." 

"Okay. Please give me the initiation here now," I said. 

"No, no. You meet us in Denver. We will hold big seminar there. You must 
join and then you receive initiation." 

"I'm going to India. Why should I change? How can I know if your 
Knowledge is correct or not?" 

For 20 minutes they tried to persuade me. 

At the end of that time, two sentences finally struck me: "We are opening 
doorway to God. You should at least try." I couldn't deny that. 


I immediately canceled my flight to India, and re-booked for Denver 
reasoning that I could always go to India later if their promises proved empty. 

In the evening, I arrived home with my cousins. They were excited and I 
was inspired. Everyone was pleased when they heard that I would be staying in 
America. Only my father was frustrated. 

"How could you change your mind so easily?" he asked. "Looks like your 
commitment was not so deep as you made it out to be." 

As the evening wore on, a strange feeling developed. Something was 
wrong, though I had no idea what. "What is it, God? How am I failing You?" I 
thought. 

Confusion overtook me. Struggling to get free, the anxiety only increased. I 
asked Baba and God to save me. At last I fell asleep, fully prostrate, praying for 
guidance. 

When I woke up this morning at 6:00 a.m., I was still lying in the same 
position. I had been dreaming and the meaning of the dream seemed 
unmistakably clear. Thrilled to the bone, I jumped up to phone Dada Birendra 
Lai. 14 

I quickly told him about yesterday's experience. Then I told him my dream: 

"Dadaji, I was in India in a room with about forty or fifty people. Baba sat 
in the front, facing us and speaking. We all knew that Bindeshwari was in the 
next room. You know, the Bindeshwari who died and was brought back to life 
by Baba's touch, and who now has miraculous psychic powers." 

"Yes, yes. I know him very well." 

"Well, we could hear many persons in that room being affected by 
Bindeshwari's touch on their foreheads—they were shouting, sighing, and 
gasping as they entered into high states of consciousness. It seemed that each of 
us in the room with Baba was thinking, T wish I were there', 

14 At this time there were three Dadas, or acharyas, in the USA. One was a renunciate (Dada 
Yatishvarananda, the Dada who taught me meditation), and the other two were married. Dada 
Birendra Lai was a family man, employed in Chicago as an engineer. In the beginning years of 
Ananda M arga, all the acharyas were family people. The renunciate or monk system only came 
later. The two family acharyas were from the original group, and thus had long experience on 
the spiritual path. While maintaining his normal family responsibilities Dada Birendra also 
guided our Chicago meditation group. The third Dada, also married, lived and worked in 
Philadelphia. 


as we all looked at the wall separating us from ecstasy. Only Baba was 
unimpressed. He turned toward the wall and yelled through it, 'Will you little 
children please be quiet!' In that same moment I woke up. 

"Doesn't it show, Dadaji, that Baba doesn't give much importance to such 
psychic phenomena? Surely it would be worse than a waste of time for me to go 
to Denver, just running after occult experience. I think I have to give myself to 
God, not try to get something for myself. Isn't is so, Dada?" 

"In 1955," Dada replied, "one devotee said to Baba, We've received 
everything by Your grace. Baba. Why don't you give bliss to everyone in the 
world right now? Why wait?' He said, T have not come to give instant bliss. 
That would defeat the purpose of life. Your purpose is to realize love-for- 
everyone-and-everything. You have to work for that.'" 

I canceled the ticket for Denver and re-booked for India. 15 

Don't thank me 

On the way to India I spent one day in New York City. I arranged to meet 
Paul at a bus stop near his house. When I stepped off the bus. he was standing 
about 150 meters away. When he saw me, his face lit up with a big smile. In 
Mississippi I had never seen him smile even once. He ran toward me and we 
embraced. 

The first thing he blurted out was, "You'll never believe it! In the last days 
I've been strongly desiring to do meditation, but couldn't remember my mantra, 
lust now as I saw you, I suddenly remembered it! Thank you. thank you. thank 
you!" 


15 Though Bindeshwari did clinically die, according to yoga it is possible that he never actually 
died. Yoga says that death is a process in which ultimately both the nerve cells and fibers die. 
There are, however, some cases in which only the nerve fibers die, but the nerve cel Is continue to 
live. Doctors declare that person to be clinically dead. This might have been Bindeshwari's 
situation. 

Baba did several times demonstrate that a person whose nerve fibers were dead but nerve 
cells alive could be restored to life, a phenomenon which medical science has not yet understood. 

Bindeshwari had some ability to raise the consciousness of others by his touch. It is a 
common occult power which is accessible to advanced spiritual aspirants. Though this same 
occult power was displayed by Baba innumerable times, He often explained the science behind 
it, together with the dangers inherent in misusing the power.
