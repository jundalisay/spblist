<!-- Having fun with a bad man 

Copenhagen. After we finished kiirtan and began group meditation this evening, I felt something evil in the air. Though I had never stood up during group meditation before, today I made an exception. I quietly walked into the front room which serves as our cooperative restaurant and community center. 

Mainjula was sitting there. 

"Did anything strange happen just now, Mainjula?" I whispered. 

"No, Dada..." 

"Have you been completely alone?" 

"Well, a man came in. He looked around for a couple of minutes, and left just before you came in." 

"Who was he?" 

"I don't know his name. He was Indian and has been here a few times before. He has a mustache, and..." 

"I know," I interrupted. "I've seen him several times recently. He's thin, has a sharp chin, and beady eyes which he shifts around as he speaks. He expresses an exaggerated interest in meditation and yoga though he's never tried to learn." 

"Yeah, that's him." 

"What was he doing just now?" 

"Nothing." 

"He must be a very bad man. His very vibration strongly disturbed my meditation. If you ever see him again, please tell me."  -->


Two days later. This morning I was so late for my Aeroflot flight to Moscow that the plane had to be delayed a few minutes only for me. 

<!-- Who could believe that I would be late for a flight that was taking me directly to Baba.  -->

There was so much to take care of before I left. I had to be either responsible and late, or irresponsible and on-time. 

<!-- Does He always have to 
make such last minute dramas?  -->

<!-- Once they rushed me aboard, the stewardess escorted me directly to my 
seat. 

With all the hurry,  -->

The man who sat beside me was the same Indian man who had disturbed my meditation 2 days ago. 

Surely he was a member of the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation in India) with instructions to follow me. 

How could he be foolish enough to reserve a seat next to mine? 

{{< r a="Indian" >}}
[With a derisive smirk] Nice to see you again. Where are you going?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
To Dacca. I appreciate your recent concern for my security. I can't figure out what you hope to find out from me. Nevertheless, you'll have  to excuse me because my curiosity is less than my repulsion for this kind of game.
{{< /r >}}
<!-- 
"Where are you going?" I asked politely. 

"To Delhi, of course." 

"What takes you to Delhi?" 

"To meet my family. " He was still wearing the 
same arrogant grin. Confident that I was also going to Delhi, he no longer had 
anything to hide—in contrast to these last days during which he had shadowed 
me in Copenhagen.  -->

<!-- "," I said bluntly, staring at him. The look on his face abruptly 
turned to bewilderment when he realized that he had miscalculated. 

I stood up and moved to another seat. Something tells me this man may 
soon lose his job. But it's not my duty to look after his security.  -->


### Personal contact 

<!-- Calcutta. Oh, Lord, my heart pounded as I waited for You upstairs in the 
Jodhpur Park office. Would You be like my dreams? Would You smile as I'd 
imagined? How would You treat me? What would You say? They said You 
would come soon-now, what delays You?  -->

After waiting seven years, seven  minutes was agony. 

30 workers lined up in the corridor. Some gossiped or hummed a tune. 

But not a sound could pass my lips; nothing could enter my mind except the 
thought of You; my heart wept, jumped, ached... 

“Parampita Baba ki jai! Victory to Baba!" Suddenly-there You were! 

<!-- Alive. Breathing. Walking towards me. Not a vision or a dream this time. You 
took over my eyes, my mind. Every muscle, every nerve leaned toward You as 
You moved down the silent row. Oh, God! That for which I was bom-fulfilled. 
If, in that moment I had died, and fallen at Your feet I would have been 
satisfied.  -->

You gave me a passing glance. I was stunned. I didn't need that, but You gave it.

<!-- Everything which follows in my life will be like toys for  an infant already suckling its mother's breast. 

You walked into Your room. The door closed. I remained-a puppet with a 
head full of sawdust. 

Then excitement, voices echoing meajun A essly down the corridor, one 
sound pierced through the din:  -->

Dada Ramananda, Baba's personal assistant said: 'Those who have not yet had Personal Contact, come here."

<!-- Only Indian workers and full-timers were around him. 

"What, you?" he said to me. "You haven't had Personal Contact yet?" 

"No, Dadaji." 

"All these years?" Without another word he turned sharply, opened Baba's 
door, and went in. 

Within seconds he reappeared, grabbed my shoulders, and shoved me 
through the door. "Go in!" I stumbled, and caught myself while the door shut 
behind me. 

I looked up. You sat alone on Your bed, smiling. I threw myself at Your 
feet, extending my arms until I was an arrow piercing the target.  -->

<!--  You spoke to me! Was I dreaming? Tears began to flow 
from my eyes. Oh, what would You say now? I had waited seven years—Baba!  -->

"What is your name, my boy?" 

"Dharmapala, Baba."

"And what is your posting?" 

"Regional Secretary of Stockholm and Oslo Regions, Baba." 

"Acha. You know you made some mistakes in your past." 

"Yes, Baba."

Now, surely You would go into detail about  my personal history. 

But no. It was not to be. A few minutes passed, some more words about 
correcting myself, about becoming a model for others. Threatened punishment 
with Your stick, the stick whistling through the air, and stopping just before 
touching me. An oath. Formalities—all formalities. 

Finished. Again I lay at Your feet, and then left. 

I had waited seven years for You to ask me my name and my posting? My 
heart sank. I am nothing special to Baba, I thought. The blood rushed to my 
head. Did I only imagine His greatness all these years? 


Dumbfounded. I stood again outside Your door, but this time there was doubt. 
Doubt—ugly and dark. 

But I had little time to brood. Ramanandaji went inside Your room, then 
came out quickly and said, "Personal Contact is finished today. Get ready for 
darshan." 

Darshan-to see: a time when all were invited to see You, or be seen by You. 
We all rushed up to the roof. 

Already about 200 people were sitting there. Following no one's example, I 
moved to the front, and sat immediately in front of Your sofa. 

Why had You talked like that to me? I felt cheated. Okay my work has been 
for humanity. But it was also to please You. And You didn't care. I'm just 
another piece from Your toolbox. 

You came and sat down. We danced kiirtan in front of You. 

Still I'll try to please You. Baba. 

We danced, we sang, we sat down, and You began speaking. 

And then, what? You looked deep within me. Your eyes twinkled. Your lips 
turned in a smile, You put Your hand to my face. You gently pinched my 
cheek, saying, "Yes, yes. And what do you say, my little boy?" I was 
speechless, smiling back. You lightly slapped my face lovingly. 

Ecstasy! 

I am special to Him! He loves me! 

If my smile had been any bigger, my face would have broken. 

You went on talking. Glancing at me again and again. And again You 
pinched me and lightly slapped me. 

Though hundreds of others were there, we might as well have been alone. 
This time You were personal to the extreme. Oh, Baba! 

You left. Again I was baffled, but this time it was sweet chaos. Why do You 
play such games? Clearly You love me. But in the Personal Contact itself. You 
said nothing interesting, and did nothing memorable. Afterward, only afterward. 
You were so loving, beyond my imagination. Why? 

Slowly I began to understand. Personal Contact is spiritual. Purely spiritual. 

It doesn't matter what happens experientially. Experience is not spiritual, it is 
mental. You did what You wanted during the Personal Contact. It will have 
exactly the proper unique effect on me, unrelated to either understanding or 
misunderstanding. 

And I know—You want me to tell others that Personal Contact is purely 
spiritual. Not to expect anything. You will do only what is necessary to deepen 
our consciousness, which is beyond any objective phenomena. My head spins. 
My samskaras rise up, dance, and accelerate to the speed of life. 

You—Tantra Gum—You care only for that spirituality. 

And You pinched me. You slapped me—why?—just to please me. You 
already did what You wanted—and then You did what I wanted.
