Benares training center. 

Each time we have group meditation, a different trainee leads it.

Today was Vimal's turn. He's a very simple fellow which means he:
- is devotional and affectionate
- often falls into trouble.

Once, when Baba was passing on a road, Vimal threw himself in full prostration at Baba's feet.

Normally this might  be an understandably humble or even spiritual act. 

But as rain had only just let up, Vimal rose to his feet covered with mud. 

While Baba pretended not to notice, Vimal's face was illumined with a broad smile. 

Today while leading the kiirtan, he gradually became more and more enthusiastic, jumping higher and wider, and thrusting his arms toward Baba's photo.

As he sang Sam'gacchadvam before meditation, he accented each word  with heartfelt emotion.

During the silent meditation, he was not so silent, uncontrollably blurting out "ah!" and "oh!" and "Baba!" with such explosive force that no one could help but be amused. 

Afterward, he could barely get through the singing of the Guru Puja, breaking into tears repeatedly. 

At last came the point for him to lead us in the Supreme Command. 

His emotions were so strong that he could not stop himself from leaping up, lifting his fist high in the air, and shouting with full fanaticism, "THE SUPREME COMMAND!" 

With these words, he collapsed on his back, falling upon some of us.

We burst into laughter. 

But he did not hear our response. His eyes were closed. 

He remained in super-consciousness (samadhi) for 2 hours.

Devotees each have their own unique way.

The ancient Sanskrit verse, sam ‘gacchadvam', is sung before group meditation. It comes from the Rk Veda, composed about 15,000 years ago, and means—Let us move together, let us sing together, let us come to know our minds together, let us share like sages of the past, uniting ourselves in intention and mind

Guru Puja is performed after meditation. One offers one's strongest attachment or ego to the infinite Entity, and ultimately offers oneself

The Supreme Command was written by Baba. It contains the most essential guidelines for a spiritual life.


### Passing by chance 

Over the last weeks, my health has again crumbled, to the point that I can barely walk.

But I never complain, and I accept the troubles as a help to solidify and increase my realization. 

Still it's hard for me to joke—my mind needs much more expansion. 

Studying is a tiring task. The 400 meaningless shlokas are the worst part.

Ten days ago I passed both the Prout and spiritual philosophy examinations, but have yet to fully memorize the shlokas. Every time I look at them, my head spins. Sometimes I think I forget more than I remember.

Difficult as it is, the studying has its own merit—to discipline the mind even while feeling exhaustion and discomfort. 

October.

I really have no idea how I managed, but by cramming and by the Lord's grace I learned enough shlokas to pass the exam. 

There were many I didn't know, but by "chance" the examiner quizzed me mostly on the shlokas I had learned. 

Of course I will soon forget them, but it doesn't matter—my concentration has been improved radically by the exercise.

The second phase of my training is completed. I will go to Patna for the third phase. Perhaps it's just in time—for my health. 


### Pandemonium with a purpose 

Ananda Marga's permanent global office is in Ananda Nagar. The global camp office is presently in Patna—it is here that Baba lies in a poorly ventilated, inferior jail cell.

Patna is a half-day's bus ride away from the Nepal border. It is an ordinary congested Indian city filled with poverty, filth, and hidden mysticism.


A yoga school or spiritual center is beautiful, calm, immaculately clean, organized, disciplined class programs, healthy food shared collectively, everything moving according to fixed schedule, and a staff who reflect only profound inner peace. 

Our global office is the direct opposite.

The three-story concrete building is overflowing with paper work, maintained in shabby, irregular files. Old office equipment in various stages of disrepair occupy much of what would otherwise be our living space.

Scores of Dadas and Didis dressed in every shade of orange scurry about, struggling to fulfill unannounced, urgent social work targets.

They say the number of workers increases to 500 at the time of their monthly meetings—somehow everyone adjusts. 

In every room, nay. in every comer, different schedules are followed—many work throughout the night and get little, if any, sleep.

Irregularity of meals due to the pressure of work is the norm rather than the exception—a common example of a hurried meal is peanuts, puffed rice and a banana. 

Yet there is something wonderful here! One hears conversations and sees documents concerned with:
- medical clinics
- cheap kitchens
- disaster relief
- philosophical publications
- cultural clubs
- poor students' book cooperatives
- anti-exploitation movements

At any moment, in the midst of the apparent chaos, there is someone singing devotional songs, and someone else sunk in deep meditation. 

In between the paper work they practice their yoga postures.

Their enthusiasm, their laughter, their disagreements, their unperturbed concentration amid constant distractions—it all clearly demonstrates the Tantric spirit, the zeal to fight against any difficulty for the upliftment of self and society. 

I enjoy this.

Here is where I'll finish training. I arrived today with another trainee who passed the second phase with me, a German named Praveda. 

Our trainer is a highly elevated Dada. Some say he naturally exudes power to those who sit in meditation with him.

Recently he completed a 40-day protest fast which was the first of its kind in Ananda Marga.

A demonstration against the injustice of Baba's incarceration, it gained widespread newspaper coverage.

Our coursework consists of copying and memorizing various notebooks concerned with our spiritual and organizational functions. The trainer will also give us regular classes. 

Living conditions are slightly better than Benares.

We 2 westerners are staying in an Ananda Marga students' hostel 500 meters away from the global office, and living space is sufficient.

We receive a small weekly allowance with which we purchase and prepare our meals. 

I guess I'll be able to save money while still eating in a way which for me now seems luxurious. 

Today, for example, we breakfasted on tomatoes, puffed rice and yoghurt. I can't help but feel it seems God-sent.
