During our global reporting sessions, Baba has a fixed order in which He calls the representatives from the different sectors of the world. 

At present I am representing Hong Kong sector, as the Far East Asia sector, which is always the first sector to be called. 

BABA: How many district in-charges came from the ladies' section of Hong Kong Sector? 

GLOBAL HEAD OF WOMEN’S WELFARE DEPARTMENT: None. Baba... 

BABA: Haat! What nonsense? Let the lady representative of Hong Kong Sector step forward. (Silence. No one moves.) What is this? Is there no representative even? 

GLOBAL HEAD WOMEN'S DEPARTMENT: I ... I'm sorry. Baba. She did not arrive yet. 

(In fact, all the Didis of all sectors except Hong Kong are present. There is no question of "yet".) 

BABA: What a sorry scene. Stupid, nonsense. Then let the male representative of Hong Kong Sector step forward. 

(I move to the front.) What is the excuse? 

(I remain mum.) How can you justify such nefarious behavior? 

(Though; I am silent, and nothing could be more awkward, nevertheless I'm enjoying His attention. Any attention is better than none.) 

How many district in-charges are present from the male side of Hong Kong Sector? 

ME (unhesitating, with a clear voice, head unbent): Zero, Baba. 

(An abrupt silence rolls over the room. Everyone holds their breath, expecting an onslaught from Baba. Sure enough...) 

BABA (shouting at such a volume it can be heard well beyond the closed door): 

What?! You foolish idiot! Scoundrel rascal! Then what was your purpose in coming here?! Have you come just to enjoy yourself?! Just to kill our time?! You have no right to be here! (Pointing His finger toward the door, He shouts at ear-splitting volume:) Get out!! Get out!! Get out just now!!! 

ME (speaking quickly): But, Baba, district in-charges are on their way from Taiwan—they will surely be here any moment. 

(Though this is a possibility, it sounds like a common, lame excuse. Everyone in the room remains super tense.) 

BABA (turning His head from side to side, squinting His eyes, pushing His lower lip out, and speaking in a radically opposite voice, that is, softly and slowly): 

But... don't they know? ... Don't they know that they are to arrive here by the 30th?... GS Dada? (Confusion reigns in the room due to Baba's sudden mood change.) 

GENERAL SECRETARY: Yes, Baba, they must know. (Silence as Baba turns His head again and again.) 

BABA (in a low, almost inaudible voice): Alright... and ... Manila Sector ... what is your status? 

After receiving Baba's spiritual force, my mind was so blown that I could not think what to do next. Several Central workers motioned me to fall back into line. The session continued on a low key. 

A few minutes later. Baba signaled the end of reporting. After the Didis and sisters left the room, we performed Madhur Sadhana in front of Baba. 82 

Then He left the room. Immediately, four or five Central workers came to me and asked, 
"What happened? Just when we were sure you would be out on your ear, and all of us would have to step forward to give explanation for your indiscipline; just when we thought there would be a thick drama complete with punishment; just then. Baba changed His mood and let you go. He saved you. Dharmaveda- 
nanda." 

82 Madhur Sadhana is a special spiritual practice which includes kiirtan. It is done only by 
acharyas. Didisand Dadasperform it separately. 

"I don't have any idea," I said. "My district in-charges really are coming, you know." 

"Sure, sure!" they all laughed, not believing me.

Two overseas workers then walked up to me. Expressing surprise, they said, "Hey, what? You're still here? But Baba told you to get out, didn't He?" 

Now I laughed. The tension and impact created by Baba's shouting had been so much that these two workers had not even perceived the exchange afterward between Baba and me about the Taiwan district in-charges. These two must have been in shock. 

I was about to leave the room when Baba's personal assistant, Keshavanandaji, re-entered. 

"Dharmavedananda, Baba just asked me to collect any further information on the Taiwan district in-charges." 

"I don't know," I said uneasily. "They were... supposed to come by now." 

"Baba mentioned that they may now be somewhere between Nepal and India." 

"It could be," I said. "I don't know." "And He wants an investigation made." 


I laughed nervously. What was this all coming to? Was He planning to catch me on another day about my so-called missing Margis? I sighed, thinking, He will do whatever He likes.

 <!-- A rid whatH e likes is perfect.  -->

Three days later. Twice daily Baba has been asking for any report on the 
Taiwan Margis. At last today information arrived from northern Bihar near the 
Nepali border. 

The four Taiwan Margis really are there—but they are in jail! 

Getting Indian visas in Taiwan is an extremely long process, and to avoid being late, they came without visas, trying to cross the border without being seen. 

Surely Baba saw their situation in that same moment when He suddenly changed His mood in reporting. 


Three months later. Tokyo. 1986. Today I spoke by phone with Taipei. The four brothers and sisters who were arrested in India arrived back home a few days ago. After their ordeal, they received a hero's welcome. 

They spent three months being shifted from prison to prison in northern Bihar. For part of that time they were held in the Bankipur Jail in Patna where Baba had stayed. For one month they fasted on only water and juice to protest their imprisonment. During that time, they had special experiences of Baba's grace—brother Keshava even had a few visions of Baba in his cell.

Toward the end they all had the clear intuitive foreknowledge of the exact date that they would be released. Though they were unable to enter India, their risks and sacrifices led to some colorful moments. Dare I say the spiritual benefit was even greater than if they had passed undisturbed into India and physically met Baba? 


## Dream trance 

Benefit concert held on behalf of our work in Burkina Faso, Africa. 550 
people attended. By the collection from this program a medical center will be 
built. 83 

I had a dream early this morning: 

After walking through a pasture alone with Baba, we stood outside His 
house. He told me, "It will be highly useful for you to engage in three 
activities. The first is writing. Your writing will enable you to contact many 
leading personalities. And that is your second work: to meet such leaders. For 
example, university presidents,...." His voice trailed off, so I could not catch 
the other examples. 

At that moment a few workers and Margis joined us. 

"I know some leading musicians who might perform for our benefit 
concerts," I said. 

"That's nice," Baba said. 

Brother Naviin, a Margi musician said. "I would love to hear those 
performers. Baba, a few years ago we arranged a large concert in the United 
States, but...." 


83 At this time the work in Burkina Faso was only just beginning. It took several years to gain 
the trust of the poorest tribal people of this poorest African country. At the time of publication 
the project was established in twelve villages, providing training for the local people to construct 
wells, build irrigation systems, establish grain storehouses, and provide basic medical services. 



"Yes, I know," Baba said, smiling. "I was there with you. and it rained. 
Better to make such programs indoors." 

Before He could mention the third activity, we all went inside His house, 
and then into His office. He sat behind His desk and said to me, "Well, come 
here now. My son should get something." 

I walked up to Him. and He gave me a tap on the top of my head with His 
knuckles. I thought. Now let's see what I feel. But there seemed to be no special 
sensation. 

He directed me to sit down, and then said, "No need of any more words." 
He placed an egg-shaped bag over my head. I understood He was deepening 
my spiritual awareness. Gradually the breathable air decreased, but I didn't 
mind because I knew Baba was in full control. Thinking this. I entered a trance 
in which all thought was suspended. 

I awoke in that condition.
