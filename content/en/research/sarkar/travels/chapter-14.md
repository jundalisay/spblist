Wales, United Kingdom. 1980. Today at the breakfast table, I commented to some Margis, "Perhaps I have a special blessing from Baba. In the 9 years I've been working for Ananda Marga, I've never missed a train, bus or plane. 

Even when I arrive at the station late, the trains and buses in those cases are also late." 

"What's the explanation for this, Dada?" a sister asked. 

"Well, it's surely not my own power. If I weren't working for dharma (righteousness). I'd miss the bus just like anybody else. Simply speaking, the Cosmic Force protects those who serve It." 

"How about some more apple pie, Dadaji?" she said. 

"Sure, thanks." 

"But, Dada," my host, Karun said, "there's no time for more pie now. Your train for Liverpool leaves in just 20 minutes." 

"No problem," I said. I ate the pie at a leisurely pace. 

We left after about ten minutes. Since we were late, Karun drove me by motorcycle as fast as he could. Still, we arrived one minute past the scheduled departure time. We sat down on the platform to wait for the late train. 

Five minutes passed in pleasant conversation. Then as one lady walked by, I asked, "Excuse me, do you know how late the train to Liverpool is?" 

"It's not late," she said. "It came on time and left on time." "What?" I was shocked. "How can that be?" "I think it's not unreasonable, sir." she said, and started to walk away. 


"Dada, there's always a first time, you know," said Karan. "I told you not to 
eat that pie." 

"No!" I said, jumping up. "There must be a way. Excuse me again," I said, 
running after the same lady, "but do you know any other way to Liverpool? I've 
got to be there by 6:00 this evening for a lecture." 

"Well, my husband sometimes takes a morning bus to Liverpool. But that's 
surely left by now." 

"We have to try!" I said. "Where does it go from?" 

"It leaves about seven kilometers from here. Straight down that road. But I 
tell you, it's already too late." 

"Thanks! Let's go, Karan!" 

I pulled Karan onto the motorcycle. Even as we rode off, he protested at the 
futility of it. "I tell you, that pie did you in, Dada," he said. "Apple pie yanked 
you off the path of D harma!" 

About three kilometers down the road, we spotted a bus on the side of the 
road. "Stop the bike!" I yelled. 

I ran to the bus. and leapt inside. 

"Is this bus going to Liverpool?" I asked. 

The driver had his head underneath the steering wheel, and was trying to 
see something. "Don't bother me, buddy." 

"Please, just tell me, are you going to Liverpool?" 

"We will, damn it, if this bus ever gets going again." 

I laughed and said. "Don't worry. I'm sure it will start soon." 

lust as I said that, he turned the key and the engine roared. 

As the bus drove off, I stuck my head out the window. "Thanks for the 
pie!" 

Karun yelled at me, "You lucky stiff!" 

Ten days later. Oslo, Norway. I was busy until late last evening, reviewing 
the meditation lessons of a few Margis. Abaniish knocked on my door. 

"You're going to miss your train to Stockholm, Dada," he said. "I never miss. Don't worry." 

By and by, I got ready. Once in the car, Abaniish drove like mad. When we 
arrived at the station, Abaniish and the other Margis jumped out and ran. I 
walked. "Dada, hurry up!" 

"Baba will take care," I replied. 

But just as the platform came in sight, the train pulled away. 

I stood there flabbergasted. 

"Dada, why didn't you run?" Abaniish said. 

"There's no time for talk now," I said. "Where's the next stop?" 

"Well, Lillestrom," he said. "But it's too far away. It'd be out of the question 
to try and catch up with the train." 

"I don't care!" I said. "We've got to make it." 

I ran toward the car. Abaniish laughed, and came after me slowly. When he 
finally got to the car, he said. "There's no way, Dada. Just admit you missed it." 

But I insisted, so reluctantly he drove. All the way to Lillestrom he kept 
saying, "This is crazy. It's impossible! We're just wasting our time." But I 
pushed him to drive faster. 

Twenty-five minutes later, as we came near the Lillestrom station, we saw 
the train also approaching. "I can't believe it!" Abaniish said. "It's like a 
movie!" 

As the car screeched in, I threw the door open, sprinted to the train, and 
jumped in, out of breath. Then, anti-climactically, the train remained there for a 
few minutes. The Margis jogged up, clapping their hands. 

"Congratulations, Dada," Abaniish said. "Any parting remarks for the 
fans?" 

"Yeah," I said. "Though we Dadas may not have to worry about catching 
our trains, it's still better to arrive early." 

Due to their laughter, perhaps they didn't hear me add. "I got your message. 
Baba. Twice in ten days is enough." 

A great force behind your work
