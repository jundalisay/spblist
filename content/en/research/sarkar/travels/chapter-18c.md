Usually Baba's darshans are appropriate for compilation into book form. 

For example. His Sunday darshans serve as chapters in Shabda Cayanika, an alphabetic encyclopedia, packed with original stories and information concerning the derivation of thousands of words. 

Today was different. Since it was the 10-year anniversary of Baba's release from the jail, His speech was special. It being rare for Him to talk of His personal life, I quote the translation of the darshan here in its entirety: 

We did not mean to harm anyone. But when adharmic (unrighteous) people use force against you, you must act in self-defense. This is not himsa (violence), it is pratirodha (self-defense). Those who opposed us met a pathetic end and have now merged with the soil. 

People who follow unrighteousness believe they have the right to do anything they want. 

One lady thought she could do anything she wanted with her power. When no reaction comes immediately, sinners think they can get away with more. But gaining power, going up, does not mean that they are getting elevated.

Like the Indian washerman who raises the clothes high over his head, they go up very high only to come smashing down. 22 

Some people say that for every action there is an equal and opposite 
reaction. But I do not say that. After time, the reaction is greater because it 
comes with interest. 

3,500 Margis and workers were arrested by the government.

All were innocent, yet the political leaders felt no guilt at all in using their power against these innocent people. 

In jail, the Central Bureau of Investigation authorities harassed me in every way. For example, there was a rule that when I met with visitors the officers could be present, but not within hearing distance. 

One time, though, a new CBI man stood very close, silently listening. I asked him who he was—he replied that he was newly appointed. So then I asked him his name and address. He became nervous and could not reply. So I shouted and abused him until he ran away. Then the other officers, 
who clearly were aware of this plot, began to criticize that man in order to 
appear innocent.

91 Eventually I ndira Gandhi was killed by her own security guards, and her thoroughly corrupt 
son, Sainjaya Gandhi, died when his private plane crashed. One day before Indira Gandhi's 
death, Baba asked the meaning of the word assassination. He said that it came from one ass on 
top of another ass, and on top of that is/, and on top of that is the nation. Indira's other son, 
Rajiv Gandhi, then took her place asPrimeM inister, and was later also assassinated—finally 
ending that family's influence on India. 
 

But I had bit down so hard while scolding him that two of my false teeth 
broke. The next day, two specialists came from the government hospital to 
replace the broken teeth. I asked them, "How is it that these teeth broke so 
easily?" They replied, "Baba, they are only plastic, they are fragile." But 
according to the prison regulations, the treatment of the eyes and teeth of 
prisoners is their own responsibility, not the government's. I knew these 
specialists had been sent because the officers were feeling guilty at what they 
had done. So I asked them, "How can I chew my food every day with teeth 
given by the sinful government?" Then my personal assistant, Ramananda 
suggested that if we pay them for the work it would be alright, so I agreed. 

When I was released, there was such a long procession—do you 
remember? The jail authorities, seeing the crowds waiting, told me that they 
would also be willing to undergo imprisonment if such a procession would be 
awaiting them on their release. 

I faced so much trouble in the jail. When I was released. I could not walk. 
To go to the toilet I had to hop on my hands like this (He demonstrated). I had 
to use a wheelchair. I remember that my elder sister brought me two luchis 
(small fried breads) and vegetables, but after my long fast I could only eat half 
of one of the luchis with great difficulty. 

I do not want anyone to undergo the same trouble that I did. But in the 
struggle for dharma (righteousness), if some trouble comes, you should accept 
it. If you pick a flower, you may be pricked by its thorns. Your consolation is 
that your struggle will surely end in victory. Our path is klista/dklistd— initially 
there is trouble, but in the end there is no trouble. 

Dharma is the cause of victory. Intelligent people should take the help of 
Dharma. If you want to go to Jammu, you should take a seat on the Jammu 
express train—automatically you will reach there. Similarly you should follow 
the path of Dharma and surely you will be victorious. 



### Four problems to extinguish

This incident occurred during the district in-charges reporting session of the North Area of the Indian Sector. 

Baba called forward brother Ram Chandra. For several days, he could not get personal contact with Baba because he had failed to establish a school. He was also arrogant and argumentative. 

BABA: Fix your mind at manipura chakra (the navel center). Now raise it step by step. To the anahata chakra (heart center). To the vishuddha chakra (throat center). To the ajina chakra (third eye)...  Now, are crude or subtle thoughts coming? 

RAM CHANDRA (standing with eyes closed): Only subtle thoughts, Baba. 

BABA: Now, take your mind downward. Vishuddha... anahata... manipura ... svadhistana (genital area)... muladhara (bottom of the spine). How is your thought now? 

RAM CHANDRA: Baba... material thoughts are coming non-stop. 

BABA: Again take your mind upward ... Wait. What's there at the kidney? 

RAM CHANDRA: I've throat trouble, Baba. 

BABA: No. The cause, the initial cause lies in the kidneys. 

Due to malfunctioning in the kidneys, toxic air rises up causing complication in the lungs. What's that at the anahata chakra) Did you ever have any violent experience in the area of your chest? 

RAM CHANDRA: I received a blow there when I was a student. 

BABA: Do the doctors tell you there is any medical problem? 

RAM CHANDRA: They say I have a peptic ulcer. 

BABA: Then why didn't you ever check it with Dada Vijayananda? 

RAM CHANDRA: I thought I had tuberculosis. 

BABA: TB is there, but it's only developed 1-2%. Should I give punishment to you alone or in front of others? 

RAM CHANDRA: It's up to you, Baba. (He suddenly does prostration at Baba's feet.) 

BABA: Stand up, my boy. Kinshuk, take my stick. (Kinshuk is Baba's adopted son.) Touch his left side. (Kinshuk touches his hand to RC's left side.) No! You must not touch with your hand, only with the stick! 

RAM CHANDRA: It burns where he touched me.

BABA: Now touch him with the stick. (Kinshuk does so.) How does it feel? 

RAM CHANDRA: Oh ... it's very very soothing. 

BABA: I have a pet buffalo I brought up with much care. He can enter in any one's body, which is called Parakaya Pravesh. He can also enter anyone's mind, which is called Paramana Pravesh. I keep this buffalo always with me. 

Without him, you boys and girls would suffer a lot... This boy should have at least contacted the proper persons to ask about his problems. You must all be careful of four things: 

1. Sickness
2. Enemies
3. Debt 
4. Fire

Whenever any of these arise, you must extinguish them completely or they may come back. Let it be as a principle in your lives... My buffalo has the 8 occult powers and knows everything ... You must receive some punishment. What will it be? 

RAM CHANDRA: Any punishment, Baba. 

BABA: From now on you must be a good boy. Accordingly from today, you are completely cured. 92 


I inquired about Ram Chandra a few months later. A Dada who knew him told me he had 
not only been completely cured, he had also become a model for all the other Margis. Each day 
after completing his normal job, he would dedicate several hours for social work. The units 
under his guidance were becoming more active, and a primary school was started.
