Calcutta. August 2. Since June, for the first time in Ananda Marga's history. 

Baba has been calling all workers and Margis from all sectors to Calcutta. I arrived today.

In total, several thousand people have come or will come. 

The program is called dharma samiksha. Samiksha means "analysis". So dharma samiksha means "analysis of one's adherence to the right path."

During dharma samiksha, Margis and workers stand one-on-one in front of Baba who comments on their good and bad behavior.

The 16 Points for physical, mental and spiritual development is especially relevant to this analysis. 

I was allowed to stay in the room continuously, so I had the opportunity to witness many cases. 

Brother J from the Netherlands, who I've known for 2 years, stepped forward. Baba sat on His couch, looking over His shoulder at the wall. 68 


GENERAL SECRETARY (GS): What is his name and posting? 

DADA FROM EUROPE: He is J, district in-charge from Holland. GS: Who is your acharya? J: Dada Maetreya. 

GS: What work did you do over the last 6 months? 

{{< r a="J" >}}
(nervously): I arranged 9 initiations, opened one People's Night School, and started one Spiritualists' Sports and Adventurers' Club. 
{{< /r >}}

â€œBaba rarely looks directly at anyone. When He does, we feel a special energy or shakti.

A single glance from Him is often enough to satisfy any Margi who may have traveled thousands 
of miles to meet Him. 

GS: Acha. Are you following 16 Points strictly? 

{{< r a="J" >}}
Yes. 
{{< /r >}}

GS: How about your meditation? 

{{< r a="J" >}}
Yes, Dada. 
{{< /r >}}

GS: How about fasting? 

{{< r a="J" >}}
Yes, Dada. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
GS, ask him about food. 
{{< /l >}}

GS: Are you taking only sentient food? 69 

{{< r a="J" >}}
Yes, Dada. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Eh? What did he say? 
{{< /l >}}

GS: He said "yes''. Baba. You are not taking any static food? 70 

{{< r a="J" >}}
No, Dada. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
(turning to look just over J's head): Eh? What nonsense are you speaking? 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="J" >}}
No, no. Baba. Only sentient food. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
(slightly angry): Tell the truth! 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="J" >}}
No, Baba, I... ah ... oh. Baba... 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Do you deserve punishment? 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="J" >}}
Yes... 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Stretch out your palm. (J holds his right hand palm-up in front of Baba.) How many shall I give you?  10, 20, 30...? 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="J" >}}
20, Baba. (Using His stick. Baba strikes J's open palm ten times.) 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Stretch out your left palm. (J does so, and Baba strikes it ten times also.) You must never again intentionally harm your body. Do you understand? 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="J" >}}
Yes, Baba. 
{{< /r >}}

[Baba then explained a number of points to J about improving his meditation and service activities.) 


{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Now stand straight. (He sweeps His eyes from J's feet to head, and down again.) Vijayananda, make a note. 
{{< /l >}}

<!-- DADA VUAYANANDA: Hah, Baba. 71  -->

<!-- Sentient food isfood which isgood for both bodyand mind. 

70 Static food isfood which is harmful for either body or mind. 
Hah means" yes".  -->

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Karmasana, Gomukhasana....[and some other yoga postures I forget.] (Speaking to J:) Afterward learn them from Vijayananda. 

Now come close, my boy. (J approaches Baba, who opens His arms, and then embraces J, taking him on His lap.) 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="J" >}}
Oh, Baba! (He starts weeping.) 
{{< /r >}}

ANOTHER DADA (after a lapse of a few moments, speaking softly): Come, come... 

(J leaves Baba's lap. He lies on the floor in front of Baba, hands stretched out toward Him in the traditional position of respect to the guru. After a few seconds, he gets up, and moves toward the door.) 

GS: Next. 

After a few more dharma samikshas, we all left Baba's room. Brother J talked to me.


{{< r a="J" >}}
When Baba pressed me, I denied eating any bad food.

I was just too embarrassed to tell the truth. I knew that Baba knew, and also that He understood why I was lying. 

3 weeks ago, I was feeling so much clash. I was fed up with everything that was happening to me. 

So I bought a box of fried shellfish. I ate them alone in the yoga house. Afterward I felt so bad I vomited." 
{{< /r >}}

<!-- , and even I'm sure He did not mind, because He knows our inner motivation. -->

I laughed loudly. 

His eyes opened wide, and he said:

{{< r a="J" >}}
Dada, how can you laugh? What I did is very bad
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
Perhaps, but it's not the end of the world. We've seen mistakes a hundred times worse.
{{< /l  >}}

{{< r a="J" >}}
Really?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
Of course. And anybody who's spent much time around Baba gets used to it. This is Tantra. Up a lot and down a little, up a lot and down a little...
