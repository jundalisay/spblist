July. News from Patna: The defense has started presenting their arguments. 

Only You know. Baba, what will happen, what You've planned. But I'm 
sure part of Your plan is to make me mad for You. 

Timmern, Germany. The only full-timer left in my region is Dhruvadev, 
who doesn't want to become an acharya. As expected, my higher authority was 
furious. Baba, You have to help. 

Today, the new Berlin Sector full-timer training session started here. I am 
the trainer together with another Dada. It's a one-month program, and the 
biggest we've ever held. Ninety Margiis are attending. Thirty of them are from 
Scandinavia. Of course, most of the trainees are only here for the experience. 
Let's see how many He inspires to become real full-timers. 

Free at last! 

Today's news!!!! What news!!!! It's the happiest day of my life!!!! Baba is 
released!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

After seven years of imprisonment and over five years of fasting, He is 
vindicated, absolved of guilt. 

The true criminal is Indira Gandhi's administration. By using deceit, 
bribery, corruption, intimidation, torture, defamation—what to speak of a total 
ban against Ananda Marga and imprisonment of all Margiis and workers—Mrs 
Gandhi and her cohorts have tried their best to finish off Baba and Ananda Marga but they have failed miserably. 

History will document all the steps that the forces of Nature will take against the real 
sinners. We need do nothing against them, nor can we hate them. Though they 
are full of negativity, they too are unwitting tools of God's play. 

My beautiful Baba. I still have not physically seen Him. They say He's 
withered, emaciated—maintained only by His psycho-spiritual power. Now His 
fast will finish, and He will surely regain His robust constitution. Clouds cannot 
long overcast the sun. 

And I will see Him at last!!! Like Him, I have also waited these seven years. 

(Yes, I'll go to India. But first I have to finish the local full-timer training 
session which is going perfectly.) 

Guidance from afar 

Timmern. 8 August. I've been tortured by asthma for many nights. Deep 
within. I don't mind. It's an interesting test. But it's my duty to try to cure it. so I 
have experimented with many remedies. Yesterday I even began a cure 
recommended by our local Margii doctor Sukumar in which I must twice daily 
cleanse my intestines by drinking my urine. I did it yesterday but found it so 
repulsive that I discontinued it today. Baba Himself would have to instruct me 
to undergo this treatment before I would take it up again. 

Ten days later. A circular arrived from India, highlighting many new points 
given by Baba. For me, the most interesting one is that He criticizes Indian 
Prime Minister Moraji Desai's daily health-habit of drinking his own urine. 
Desai often openly declares its curative value. Baba, however, says urine is the 
most crude substance one can ingest. 

The circular is dated 9 August. This means He directly caught my thought, 
"Baba You have to personally instruct me if You want me to resume this cure." 
But instead of telling me to resume it. He forbid it. 

Of course there's no way that news of my experiment could have been 
conveyed to Calcutta. 

[Author's note: About two years later, I had an experience which 
paralleled the above one. It also happened in Germany: 

"About two weeks ago the Dadas and Didis came from all over the sector for RDS. To break the tension one evening, a few of us went to a movie. 

Once there, it was certainly our duty to maximally enjoy ourselves, and eliminate the greatest possible tension. Accordingly, we laughed our heads off. 

Little did we know that the local district secretary of Ananda Marga 
was also present in the same theater. The next day he complained to our higher 
authority that 'The Dadas' behavior was unsuitable for acharyas.' 

Today a circular came from India with a few new conduct rules from 
Baba, including: 'Acharyas must not go to public movie theaters.' 

Without going into details. I'm one hundred percent sure that no one 
reported our pleasurable evening at the movies to India. Considering that the 
circular was dated the day afterwards, I believe this is yet another instance of 
Baba's sticking His adorably ethereal nose into our personal lives. Having an 
all-knowing guru has both its advantages and disadvantages."! 

Full-timer training ended today. Congratulations. Baba! You inspired ten of 
the thirty trainees from Scandinavia to become full-tim-ers-exactly filling the 
gap created when the previous ones left to becoming acharyas. 

Another perfect work by the Mystic Sculptor. 

Ten for ten! His blessing is clear: He likes, no. He loves this kind of noble 
risk. 

Before leaving for India, I will place all the new full-timers in the field. 

Yes: my flight is booked for India, and this time I will see You. Nothing 
can stop our meeting now....Unless You play some last minute nasty trick. 
Don't You dare do that. Baba! Not this time, please.
