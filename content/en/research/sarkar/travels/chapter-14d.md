Five of us were sitting together with Baba in His room late last night when the electricity failed. 

Someone lit a candle. Baba spoke of mystical matters, and then of the future. 

At one point He asked us a question:

"When the spiritual-moralists gain power, when they are in a position to directly influence the society, what is the first major initiative they should implement ?" 

The first and foremost change they should execute is the elimination of the passport and visa system. 

This system is the greatest hindrance to the establishment of universal kinship." 


### Making ideal humans 

In today's reporting session all the district in-charges of the north area of the Indian Sector were present. 

A district in-charge who was about 35 years old stood in the front. 

Baba asked him, "Do you know you are suffering from tuberculosis?" 

"Yes, Baba." 

"Did you seek diagnosis and treatment by a medical doctor?" "Yes, Baba." 

"And did it help?" "No, Baba." 

"Why didn't you take the help of any Dada? And why do you still secretly continue your nasty habit with that lady?" 

Baba's words sent a shock through the room. The Margi quickly shuffled his feet and simultaneously sighed. He was so embarrassed that he looked ready to die. 

"Do you think Baba cannot see?"

"No, Baba ... Baba knows everything." 

"Do you deserve punishment." 

"Yes, Baba." 

"Take off your shirt. Yes. Now come closer." 

Baba raised His stick in the air and brought it down with a snapping sound 
below the ribs on the right side of the man. Once, twice, three times. The Margi 
winced slightly.

"Turn in the other direction." 

He beat him now thrice on the left side. 

"If you correct yourself, and reinvest that misutilized energy in social work, you will become a new man. An ideal man. What do you say?" 

He stood up a little straighter and said, "Baba, I will be an ideal man." 

"Eh, what did you say?" 

In a forceful voice he said, "Baba, I will be an ideal man!" "Have you all heard his words?" We all said, "Yes, Baba." 

"GS Dada, take my stick. Now, touch it to his chest. Yes, and twist it back and forth." 

As the General Secretary turned the stick, the man suddenly took a deep and long breath. 

"Now do the same at the opposite point of his back." 

Again the Margi took a strong breath. 

"How do you feel now, my boy?" 

"I feel very good, Baba!" 

"Have you had any x-rays taken?" 

"Yes, Baba." 

"Tomorrow go to the hospital and have another x-ray made. You will see that your disease is now 80% cured. It will soon become completely cured if you strictly follow the Sixteen Points (of physical, mental and spiritual health). What do you say?" 

"I will be the ideal son of Baba!" 

"Yesss." Baba gave a slight wave of His hand. 

After paying his respect, the Margi stepped back into his place. 

Without further ado, as if nothing had happened, Baba continued the reporting session. 

Tonight as I sit here writing, I think back that after reporting we all left for lunch and hardly a further word was spoken about the incident. This sort of experience with Baba is so common that it no longer draws our wonder. 

For us it is no miracle—it is simply one of Baba's ways to increase our commitment to Sixteen Points and guru. And for that Margi, well, who can say why he attracted Baba's grace? 

### The world is the mind 

Goteborg, Sweden. This morning, while taking the ferry from Alborg, Denmark, I read one of the Don Juan books by Carlos Castaneda. Though I have some doubt about how completely factual his books are. they at least partially reflect the mystic teachings of the native Mexicans. 

Those teachings have something in common with Tantra, and I suppose they are derived from the ancient Tantra. I became absorbed in his idea that each person's perception of the world is simply a projection of that person's own mind—so absorbed that I did not notice the clock as the ship approached land. 

Only when I looked up from the book and saw the passengers jammed near the exit did I recall the short time I had to reach the train station after the ship's docking. If I waited for all the passengers to leave before me, I would surely miss my connection. 

With my mind still engrossed in the book's idea, that everything I see is the projection of my own thought — I stood up and walked toward the back of the crowd of waiting passengers. At least one thousand people were there. 

Though I neither spoke nor made the slightest gesture, the impatient packed crowd divided for me. 

They did so keeping their backs to me. It was unnatural—like the Red Sea parting for Moses. I was able to move forward without hindrance. 

Just as I arrived at the gate of the ship, it opened, and, without breaking my stride, I was the first to walk off. It was like a movie or a dream. I made the train just in the nick of time. 

The experience was a minor one. But it's philosophical implications have been following me and rippling my thought-waves ever since that sunny day in California. 1 

“This refers to the experience in 1969 in Chapter 2. in the entry entitled " No Outside”.
