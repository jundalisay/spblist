This reminds me of a story of a brother who visited Baba in the jail some 
years ago. 

Rajesh was a mild and quiet Indian. He visited Baba in His cell. After 5 minutes, the guard said. "Time's up. You'll have to leave now." 

"Rajesh," Baba whispered, "the rule permits you ten minutes. Tell them strongly not to disturb us." 

Looking at the guards, Rajesh said softly, "Please don't disturb us." 


The guards laughed. Then one of them said roughly, "Now get up and get out, young man." 

"Rajesh, you have to shout at them," Baba said. 

"Please don't disturb us!" Rajesh said in a louder voice. 

The guards didn't look pleased. The leader said stiffly, "You have to follow what I say. Now leave!" 

"I told you to shout," Baba said. "You've got to do it much louder." 

"You have no right to stop me now!" Rajesh yelled. "You are violating the rules, and you are infringing on morality!" Later he said that in all his life, he had never raised his voice so loud. 

"You cannot criticize us!" said the guard. "Get out now, or we will take 
physical action against you." 

"Rajesh, you'll have to use all your force and all your anger," said Baba. 

Rajesh stood tall, pointed his finger at the guards, and with burning eyes, 
and a blasting voice shouted, "Get away, you animals!! Or else you'll have to 
suffer forever!!" 

Without another word, the guards all lowered their heads, turned and 
slipped away, tripping over each other, leaving Rajesh and Baba alone. 

"Well done, my boy, well done," Baba said. 


### Intervention 

Toronto, Canada. I've been assisting another worker here who is struggling to receive political asylum. I had some doubt if our approach was correct or not, so I called Calcutta two weeks ago. I asked Dada Rama-nanda to explain 
our strategy to Baba and to let me know His response. 

When I called back a week ago, Ramanandaji said. "I'm sorry. Baba has been too busy, and there was no scope to ask. Call me again in a few days." 

Three days ago I again called Ramanandaji and he said, "There's still been no chance. Please call later." His tone told me that he didn't want to speak to Baba about it. I was desperate, and thought, "Baba, please help..." 

Today I called Dada Ramananda, and he said, excitedly, "A funny thing. Honestly, I was hesitating to ask Baba. But just after your last call. Baba came out of His room and asked. Who was that on the phone just now?' In all these years. He has never once inquired about phone calls. I told Him your name, and before I could begin to explain your question. Baba said, 'Yes, I know what they are trying to do there. It is good. Tell them to continue their efforts.'" 

It's certainly impressive that Baba knew what we were doing without having any objective information, but I give more importance to the fact that if  He had not personally intervened we would never have received a reply. 


Bathroom power 

Oulu, Finland. I am staying in the home of a man to whom I taught meditation only yesterday. This morning, after he took his shower, he approached me and said, "Dada, I felt an extraordinary vibration in the bathroom just now. Did you cause it? Did you practice any special bathroom-meditation?" 

"Did you hear anything while I was in the bathroom?" I asked. 

"No. Should I have heard something?" 

"I mean did you hear any sound coming from the bathroom then?" 

"No. I was in my bedroom while you were bathing. It's too far away from the bathroom for me to hear anything." 

"Then I'm surprised. Yes, 1 always chant a special mantra when I finish my shower. But I never expected someone else might notice the after-effects on the bathroom itself." 

"It must be a powerful mantra! What is it? Please teach me!" 

Though I usually only teach this mantra to people who've been meditating for a good while, here was a man who was thirsty for experience, even in the bathroom. 

So I explained, "Whenever we take a shower, it's like a fresh start. 

Incantation of the bath mantra inaugurates our coming day, immerses it in God. 1 love the feeling. While still wet, we face the sun or any other source of light and chant this mantra together with some special hand gestures ." Then I taught 
him the bath mantra. 77 

77 The bath mantra itself goes like this: Pitri purushe byo ndma/ia, rishi devebyo namaha 

I pay my respect to the ancestors, I pay my respect to the pioneers and wise people B rahmarpandm, Brahma havi 

The offering is Brahma (Infinite Consciousness), the object offered is Brahma Brahmagnao Brahmanahutam 

The One to whom the offering is made is Brahma, the person who is offering is Brahma Brahmaeva tena gantavyam 

The goal of the offering is Brahma 

Brahma karma samadhina. 

When the work of Brahma is done, s amadhi (self-realization) will result.
