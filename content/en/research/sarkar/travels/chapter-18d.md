This incident happened during the reporting of North Area fulltimers. 

BABA: Is there any will power in the protoplasmic cell of a plant, animal or human being? (No one answers. Baba points at one brother.) You, my boy, come forward. (He walks in front, does prostration, then stands.) As you were walking forward, did you feel any twitching in your 
back? 

FULL-TIMER (his face showing anguish): Yes, Baba. 

BABA: As you were walking up the stairway, you felt pain in your back. Just upon entering the gate of this house, you felt pain. As you sat and stood for your last meal, you felt sharp pain. As you stood up from your last meditation there was discomfort. You could not practice yoga postures properly for the last eight days due to the same problem. Can you clearly remember each and every one of these moments now? 


FULL-TIMER (smiling): Yes, Baba. 

BABA: Should we thank my flying buffalo? Yesss. Parama Purusha (Cosmic Consciousness) has 
the key of everyone's mind. Only He has the key, and no one else. 

Whenever He likes, He can take away any capacity at any time. If a man holding a Ph.D. can speak three langu ages, He can take away the capacity for speaking one or two or all three languages, as He likes. So what should a human being do? He should surrender to Parama 
Purusha.... Kinshuk, touch the lower middle portion of this boy's back 
with my stick. (Kinshuk does so.) Is the twitching pain now finally gone? 

FULL-TIMER: Yes, Baba! 

BABA: In fact there is no will power in the protoplasmic cells of plants, animals and human beings. For the expression of will power, the periphery of the doer "I" feeling must be greater than the periphery of the done "I" feeling. Nevertheless, you should not forget that the will 
power of Parama Purusha is omnipresent-even within your smallest 
protoplasmic cells. 



During a reporting session: 

BABA: GS Dada, come forward. Now, just walk across the room in the manner of a procrastinator. 

(The General Secretary begins to walk slowly, then hesitates, then walks again, looks around, hesitates, walks a little more, and so it continues. We all laugh.) 

Yesss. GS Da is walking just like the procrastinating progress of capitalism. You know, poor people cannot contest elections in capitalist countries, for the simple reason that one needs to run up a high bill in any successful campaign. 

Will such capitalism, will such so-called democracy, solve the aching problems of the people in due time?


Part of Baba's speech to a group of Margi doctors: 

"As physicians, you must start service cooperatives. These are neither in 
the arena of producers nor consumers co-ops. Rather they are a subtle form of cultural co-ops. These can be called Physicians' Service Co-ops.

Doctors should research microvita, both positive and negative, although they are more concerned with negative. 93 Each and every day, several diseases come to this planet through inferential media from 
different celestial bodies. 

In the course of study, you should find out whether there can be a coincidence between the characteristics of metazoic cells and multi-cellular protozoic cells in the realm of physi- 
cality and in the psychic sphere.

This will help you to find medicines for newer and newer diseases. You are not acquainted with many diseases which are yet to come to this planet. If you do this research, you will find 
medicines for those ailments yet to come. 

"In the future, neither Communist mania nor philosophical phobia, 
but humanity and intellectuality will rule the earth." 

Will-power Parama Purusha style 

BABA: Kashishvarananda, hold out your right hand. Now, 
Keshavananda, you smell his hand. What do you smell? 

KESHAVANANDA: Sandalwood, Baba. 

BABA: Now smell it again.... What do you get? 

KESHAVANANDA: This time it's jasmine, Baba. 

BABA: Now smell his back.... What is it? 

KESHAVANANDA: Rose, Baba. (I am a few meters away, but even I 
smell it now. It is very sweet. I suppose everyone is catching it.) 

BABA: Shall we allow the smell to continue? If we do, then when Kashishvarananda goes for missionary work, the public and Margis will wrinkle their noses and say, "Where is that smell coming from?" 

(Looking at two Dadas on the side of the room who were unable to answer a 
previously asked philosophical question:) 

You boys, which scent do you want to come from your backs? 

TWO DADAS: Whatever Parama Purusha wants. 

93 For thousands of years yogis have declared consciousness to be the fundamental element of 
all entities. Only Baba, however, went into detail on this subject and clearly explained the 
concept of microvita. Microvita are subtle living emanations of the Cosmic Consciousness. They 
serve as the building blocks of matter and life Though several books by Baba and M argis 
elaborate the subject of microvita, they remain a mystery which is gradually unfolding through 
various sorts of research. A footnote cannot adequately explain microvita. 


BABA: Their answer is an intelligent one. This is a demonstration of 
will-power Parama Purusha-style. 

After we left the room, the sweet rose scent on Kashishvarananda 
was still perceivable by anyone who cared to approach his back. 

I don't remember the cause of Baba's comment during the reporting session. I think it was regarding a newspaper article which quoted a government minister bragging that the tax-payers had saved much by the cancellation of a construction plan. Baba said: 

"It reminds me of Sharmaji's wife's reply. While coming home from work, Sharmaji ran after the bus and just missed it. He continued running, almost caught up, when again it drove away. In the same way, he missed it again and again. At last, Sharmaji walked in the door of his house and announced to his wife, 'A big part of our financial problems are solved. I ran after the bus, missed it again and again, until I finally arrived homeâ€”thus saving my bus money.' Mrs Sharma replied, 'I'm 
disappointed. Why didn't you run after a taxi and save more money?"' 

An interesting story is circulating here. A few days ago, one Dada went to a village in northern India where no other worker had previously gone. He found many people already practicing Baba Nam 
Kevalam meditation. 

When he inquired who had taught them, he was introduced to a poor, illiterate villager. This man had been a devotee of 
Krishna and Shiva, but he thirsted for a proper guru. Because he could 
not travel, he prayed for the guru to come to him. Baba appeared at his 
house, and initiated him with a mantra and technique, exactly according 
to our system. Baba also taught him all the 16 Points practices of 
Ananda Marga, including tandava and kaoshikii dances. Then Baba 
instructed him to teach Baba Nam Ko/alam meditation throughout the 
surrounding villages. The point of interest is that Baba was in Calcutta 
all the time. 

Soon afterward, this Margi began teaching this simple meditation to a 
few other villagers. He also spoke out against idol worship and castism 
which created a large number of enemies for him in the strict Hindu 
community. One Hindu severely beat him with a stick. The Margi yelled 
at him, "Now surely God will punish you." As the beating continued, a snake appeared and bit the Hindu. 

The Hindu dropped the stick and ran to the village center where there was a doctor and also a black-magic Tantric. The doctor had no antidote so the black Tantric tried to use a mantra, but the poison remained.

As the man's body turned progressively bluer, the black Tantric told him, "Your only chance for recovery lies in your returning to the Margi for his blessing." 

He ran back to the Margi and was told to dance kiirtan, singing Baba Nam Ks/alam, with his arms held upward. He did as instructed and gradually the blue color gradually left his body, but remained in his fingertips.

Then the Margi said, "If you take a vow from the heart to propagate Ananda Marga, the rest of the poison will leave." The Hindu did so and became cured. After this incident, hundreds of villagers 
learned meditation. 

After the Dada returned with this story, two other Dadas were sent to 
the area and confirmed its veracity. Today, Baba was asked for His 
comment, but He only smiled. 94
