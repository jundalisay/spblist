Reykjavik. I am staying with a family whose daughter works on the American military base. Yesterday, when I asked her how I could enter the base, she shrugged her shoulders and said. "It's impossible, Dada. Unless you've got special permission." 

"Then how do you get in?" 

"I take the staff bus." 

This morning at 7:00 I donned civilian clothes and walked alone to an unmarked bus-stop. When the bus came, I boarded; no one asked for either identification or fare. I suppose the driver and employees were too sleepy to notice me. 

The bus cleared the check-point at the main gate of the military complex. 

Inside the base, it made a number of stops, dropped off passengers, and 
negotiated two more security posts. At its final stop, deep within this strange 
land within a strange land (treeless Iceland itself reminds me of nothing short of 
the moon), I stepped down. 

I looked around, wondering where I might find my destination. Picking the 
area where the buildings were packed together most densely, I maneuvered 
between jeeps, top brass and sentries. Perhaps because I walked as if I knew 
where I was going, no one questioned me. 

When I had sufficiently penetrated the maze of match-box wooden 
structures and concrete cubes, the moment for my biggest gamble arrived. I 
approached a passing officer. 

"Excuse me," I said. 

"Yes, sir. How can I help you?" 

"I'm a bit lost. Can you tell me where the anti-insurgency training section is?" I 
asked, wondering if there was any such place. "Who did you want to meet 
there?" he asked. Beautiful! "The chief training officer," I said. 

"The man dealing with that material has an office not far from here. Let me 
have a look at your pass to make sure you won't have any problems accessing 
the area." 

Without hesitation, simply depending on Baba, I said, "I don't have any 
pass." 

"What? Then how did you get onto the base?" 

"I just walked here, and no one stopped me." 

"Astonishing! I've never heard of such a thing before! Excuse me, sir, but 
can I know your purpose?" 

"I'm a social worker, and I have an interest in developing a course to 
discipline my staff. I think there's much to learn from military discipline." 

He looked at me intently. "Excuse me for saying, sir, but you look a bit like 
Jesus Christ." 

"Many people say that..." 

"You entered without a pass! I can't get over it. Well, perhaps there's a 
special force behind your work. Let's go to my office. I'll issue you a pass 
myself.” 

After completing the formalities, he telephoned the training section and 
arranged a jeep to take me there. When I got down from the jeep, a soldier met 
me, saying, "Come this way, sir." 


He led me to the office of a man introduced as a two-star general. 

"Sir, in what way can I be of service to you?" the general asked 

"I'm responsible for training social workers," I said. "In my experience I've found 2 qualities missing in many of our cadre. 

1. I want my men to be systematic and to move together as a disciplined work force. 

I want to help them kill whatever tendencies they have toward disorder. Each of them should develop the ability to both lead and follow.

2. I'd like them to acquire some of the qualities of guerrilla warriors

." He stared at me, giving me no inkling of his feelings. " -->

As you know better than I, the revolutionary army's make-up is different from that 
of regular troops suited for conventional warfare. Regular troops are usually 
drafted or primarily interested in the economic and social benefits of working 
in the army. Guerrilla soldiers, on the other hand, receive minimal pay. They 
mix with the general population, breathing in and out the problems of the 
common people. They face constant temptation to give up their fight and return 
to the security of normal life. So they must be fully aware, ideological, self- 
willed, creative and, above all, inspired." 

<!-- "I'm impressed, Mr ... uh, sorry, what was your name again?" 

"Jackson."  -->

"... Mr Jackson. Really impressed, both with your straight-forwardness and 
with your sincere intentions. And I do understand. Yes, indeed I do. You've put 
your finger on one of the labyrinthine problems of the military forces—how to 
encourage fighting zeal and individual initiative, while at the same time 
maintaining strict lines of order and discipline. Yes, I'm sympathetic and will 
try my best to help you. Yours is a truly novel approach to social work. Can 
you wait here a few minutes?" 

"Sure." 

When he came back, he had a two-foot pile of books in his hands. We 
spoke a bit more, he praised me again, and ordered a jeep to return me to the 
main gate. From there I took a taxi. Once inside the cab I started looking 
through the titles of the books he had given me. 

Great! I thought. Books on discipline, morale, understanding guerrilla 
warfare, physical training, collective psychology—perfect. But what's this? He must have become over-enthusiastic when I said I wanted to help our cadres kill their undisciplined habits—he included a book titled Rifle Training.
