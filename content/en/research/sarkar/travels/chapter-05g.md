### Invisible devotees 

New Delhi. I am here to extend my Indian visa, and then I'll go back to 
Patna. Ravindra and Sadhana, a devoted Margi couple, have invited me to stay 
in their house during my stay in Delhi. Ravindra is the head care-taker of the 
Delhi Zoo, so their house is in a quiet area near the Zoo. 

Today I was alone in the house. While meditating in the small room which 
they keep solely for that purpose, I heard people singing kiirtan: Baba nam 
kevalam. 

"What is this?" I thought. "Some other Margis have come?" 

I broke my meditation, stood up, and walked out of the room in the 
direction of the kiirtan. But after taking a few steps outside the room I couldn't 
hear the kiirtan anymore. I went outside the house. Only birds were singing. 

"Strange," I thought, and went back to resume my meditation. When I sat 
down, immediately my mind became concentrated. 

A few minutes later I again heard people singing kiirtan. 

"Maybe some Margis are playing a trick on me," I thought. "But this time 
I'll catch them!" I jumped up and ran toward the singing. But once more, the 
voices disappeared without a trace. Everything was perfectly peaceful. 

Scratching my head, I went back to meditate. After a short while, the 
kiirtan appeared again. 

"It must be inside my head," I thought. Partially ignoring the kiirtan, and 
partially enjoying it, I went on with my meditation. The kiirtan also continued. 
Perhaps twenty or thirty minutes later I noticed it was no longer there. 

A couple hours later, Ravindra and Sadhana came home. 

"Were you comfortable in our house when we weren't here?" asked 
Sadhana. 

"Yes," I said. "But I had a peculiar experience in your meditation room. I 
heard people singing kiirtan again and again, but nobody was there." 

The two of them immediately started laughing. 

"It's a common experience in that room," Ravindra said. "When our 
meditation is deep, we often hear that kiirtan. A few other Margis have heard it 
too." 

"Well then, at least it's nothing to worry about," I said. "Do you know the 
explanation?" 

"Invisible devotees, I suppose," said Sadhana. 

Though we all laughed, I felt her idea was not far from the truth. 

Baba exposes my secret 

Patna. A Filipino Dada who was held in the same jail as Baba for the last 
nine months was released today. 

He was standing in the comer of a large courtyard surrounded by several 
other workers and Margis. When he saw me approaching, he said, "You must 
be Dharmapala." 

I was surprised because we had never met. 

"How do you know me?" I asked. 

"Oh, Baba spoke of you many times." 

I became even more surprised. 

"What did He say?" 

"He said that it was good to see some nice American boys like you 
becoming acharya." 

"And did He say anything negative about me?" 

"Well...once when He was talking about you, He said, 'Unfortunately, that 
boy never does his asanas 24 in the evening time.'" 

I was shocked. Though I accept that Baba is omniscient, I never expected 
He would notice and expose such mundane things about me even when I was 
not present. And I am sure absolutely no one could have noticed I was not 
doing my asanas because I always shift from room to room during the evening 
since coming to Patna. 

I'll never miss my asanas again, except when it is impossible to do them. 


2i Asanas are physical yoga postures which purify the body, and to some extent also the mind, 
by harmonizing the glands, hormonal secretions, blood circulation and nerves. 


### Apparent injustice 

Over the last several days my trainer has been complaining to Praveda and 
me that his greatness is misunderstood by others, and that many Dadas are 
jealous of his spiritual accomplishments. It's true that his behavior is apparently 
eccentric: suddenly inducing high states of meditation in some of the foreigners 
who sit near him, frequently secluding himself alone for many hours in a 
locked room, eating vast amounts of food, and being so moody that he changes 
his plans every day. He often denies us classes due to "mistakes" which we 
never committed. Nevertheless I believe he is highly elevated, and that each of 
his strange actions have some underlying benevolent hidden purpose. 

The attack by the other Dadas has now gone to an extreme. They have long 
been requesting him to move away from the foreigners' quarters, and stay in the 
main central office, but he has always refused. Today two workers picked up 
all his belongings, and transferred them to a room in the central office. He was 
adamant that he would not shift, and remained in his room which was empty of 
everything except the blanket on which he sat. 

A few hours later they also physically carried him away. 

I'm astonished at this injustice! 

A decisive meeting 

We have been regularly visiting our trainer in his new room. He 
continuously talks about the wrongs being done to him, how immature the 
other workers are, and how much they have yet to grow in their spiritual 
insight. Of course, I agree with him. 

Tonight I heard that a small committee was discussing what punishment he 
should be given. I could not believe it and became angry when others told me it 
was suspected he has indulged in conduct which was wrong for an acharya. I 
felt it my duty to vouch for his innocence. The committee meeting was on the 
top floor of the four-story building. I ran up, anxious to arrive before it was too 
late. Panting, and after barely knocking, I opened the door. Another shock. 
Instead of three or four persons sitting there, about 50 or 60 orange-clothed 
Dadas turned their faces toward me. They were also surprised at my intrusion. 

"Excuse me...ah, you're having a meeting..." 


"Yes, of course it's a meeting," the gray-haired Dada standing in front said, 
gently smiling. "What do you like to say?" 

"Ah...well...pardon me but I heard you were discussing the matter of my 
trainer." 

Laughter came from all sides of the room. I was frustrated and felt even 
more angry. How dare they take my trainer's case as a joke? 

"Go ahead," the elderly Dada said, also chuckling, "and speak your mind." 

Determined to make my point. I blurted out, "I have been with him hours 
every day, and I am sure that these charges are all wrong. His character is pure 
and blemishless, and he couldn't make such a mistake." 

The Dadas exploded with laughter. Some even rolled on the ground, 
laughing so hard. I was utterly confused by their response. 

"Thank you very much," said the grinning elderly Dada. "We will keep your 
opinion in mind." The laughter increased, and I walked out of the room, more 
frustrated than ever. 

An hour later all the workers came downstairs. One of them with whom I 
am close, came to me and said. "Brother, we were not talking about your 
trainer. That was a general finance meeting."
