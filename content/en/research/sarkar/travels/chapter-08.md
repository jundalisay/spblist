### Indira and her emergency both finish 

March 1977. Indira Gandhi's "emergency" in India ended today! She over-estimated her popularity. She permitted elections to be held and lost by the biggest landslide in Indian history, receiving only a few percent of the vote. 

Already reports are coming in that all our workers and Margis are being released from jail because Ananda Marga is legal again. They tried to crush us, but our movement has only been strengthened through facing and overcoming their persecution. 

Now it only remains for Baba and a few specially accused workers to be released. With the new Janata Party government in power I am hopeful that their cases will soon come up for appeal. 

I remember something very interesting. Over two years ago, Baba issued a warning from prison: "After six months a crisis will occur in India. All Margi families should store sufficient cereals and basic necessities to weather a period of two years." 

At the time we all thought He meant an earthquake or war was coming. Six 
months later Indira Gandhi announced the emergency, and most of the fathers 
in Margi households throughout India were thrown in jail. The Margi mothers 
and children were left to fend for themselves. Thanks to Baba's warning, 
however, most of them had stored sufficient food for this period, which turned 
out to last for nearly two years. 37 

37 Another story was later told by Brij Bihari through Dada Pranavatmakananda. It happened 
in 1971, when Brij was Baba's attendant during the short time that Baba was in the hospital. 
Whileentering thebathroom, with thedoor still half open, Baba 


Reykjavik, Iceland. Rainjan and Vimala have opened a health food cooperative. This country hardly knows the expression "health food", and our shop is the first of its kind. Nevertheless, even on its first day, the shop was already full of customers. 

The bones of the immoralists will shake 


Patna, India. This is now the third time that I've been to India since becoming an acharya. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of Margis have visited Baba in Bankipur Prison. 38 Only five or six Dadas from around the world, including me, are on a special prison black-list which does 
not permit us to enter His cell.

Though I've applied many times for visiting privileges, the prison authorities always refuse. Twice I've met with the prison superintendent, only to receive the same reply. 

For some reason we select few are considered dangerous. It's surely due to the misinformation that commonly fills secret police files. One of our Norwegian Margis was able to gain access to Interpol's files through the help of a relative who works in Norway's undercover agent section. 

When he checked my name he found numerous false statements, including one declaring that I am sending $5000 every month by bank transfer to a revolutionary fund in America. The fact is that I've never sent even one penny to America. 

Today I decided to appeal directly to the Governor of the State of Bihar. When I arrived at the State Office, I explained that I was a Margi seeking an interview with the Governor. 

"The Governor is now out," the receptionist said, "but I'll see if you 
can meet the Vice-Governor." 

She left and came back after a few minutes. 

"I'm sorry. Sir. The Vice-Governor is too busy today." 

"How about tomorrow?" 

"It won't be possible," she said. 

nonchalantly said, " I n 1975 our organization will face a severe crisis. Even if you travel miles 
and miles, you will not meet anyone who will admit to being a M argi. It will be one of the most 
testing periods of the M arga.' 1 Without further comment He closed the door. Brij mentioned 
the episode to several other workers and M argis then, but no one knew what to make of it. 
3a Though Ananda M arga was by now legal and again functioning in India, Baba's case was still 
not resolved. The new J anata government ordered the courts to retry all cases decided during 
Gandhi's rule of martial law. This process was, of course, taking time. 


"Alright, I can wait a few days. Just set the time." "I'm sorry, sir. Please don't mind, but he just doesn't want to meet you." 

I thanked her and walked out. After waiting outside for fifteen minutes, I walked in again. While the receptionist was diverted by another person, I walked by her unannounced. 

Because I moved with seeming confidence through the halls of the building, no one questioned me. Having no idea where his office was, I entered one corridor after another until I finally found the proper door. Several people were sitting on a bench, waiting. I joined them without a word. 

A few minutes passed, and then the door opened. Someone came out. 
Before the door closed, I stood up and walked inside. 

It was a big room, decorated in rich aristocratic fashion. The Vice- 
Governor was sitting alone at his desk. 

He was clearly surprised to receive a visitor without prior notification. 

"How can I help you, sir?" Perhaps because I was a foreigner his tone was 
respectful. 

"I am sorry to disturb you." I said softly. "I am a Margi seeking permission 
to visit my Guru, Shri P.R. Sarkar, who is presently in Bankipur Jail." 

He started shaking slightly. 

"You should follow the normal channels with the prison authorities," he 
said. 

"I have already exhausted those. That's why I came to you." 

"Only the Governor himself can deal with your case. He's in Delhi, so you 
can contact him there, please. Thank you, and good bye." 

"In this situation, sir," I said, "it is you that should call him. Besides, I have 
information indicating that you have full power in his absence to take such 
minor decisions." 

"I cannot tolerate your indiscretions," he said, trembling a bit more. "I 
absolutely will not make any such decision on your behalf. So please leave." He 
pushed twice or thrice a button on his desk. 

"Sir, I remind you of the law of karma," I said. "For every action there is a 
resulting reaction. So you should be very careful in your dealings regarding 
Shri Sarkar." 

Now he was shaking with abandon. "Get out! Get out!" Though he pushed repeatedly on the button, no one disturbed our pleasant conversation. 

"Are you familiar, sir, with Ananda Marga's philosophy and dynamic social work? I think not, and I believe they demand your attention." 

By now he was unable to think rationally. Rather, he was sweating, shivering and madly swatting the button. 

The door opened with a bang. Two men rushed in. 

"Grab him! Grab him!" the Vice-Governor yelled. 

I was standing still, but they jumped on me like I was wild coyote, each 
one grasping an arm of my dangerous body. 

"Take him out! Take him away!" 

In a few minutes the three of us arrived at the nearby police station. I sat 
down while my two captors talked with the police for a minute and then left. 

"You're under arrest," a policeman said. 

"What's the charge?" 

They talked between themselves. Then the same man, clearly the officer inÂ¬ 
charge said, "We don't know." 

"Well, if you can't tell me, then I'll just be leaving." I stood up. "No, please, 

sir. Wait. We shortly find out charge." One man went out the door. 

After ten minutes he came back, saying, "You charged with attacking Vice- 
Governor. " 

"That's unmitigated poppycock." I know that Indians who are uneducated 
bow their heads to such language. "I didn't even touch him. I'm going." I 
moved toward the door. 

"Wait, please wait, sir!" Again the man ran out. 

On returning, he said, "Vice-Governor changed charge to threatening 
attack." 

"Tommyrot and claptrap," I said. "I was merely discussing philosophy with 
him. I can't waste any more time here." Again I started to leave. 

"Wait, sir! Just a minute, please!" They 

talked among themselves. 


The officer in-charge gave me a feeble smile. "Charges dropped, sir. Please 
no mention anyone." 

Just after returning to our Central Office, I ran into three Margi brothers on 
their way for a visit with Baba. Without mentioning what had just happened to 
me, I asked them to please pass my namaskar 39 to Him. 

Later, coming out of the jail, they told me their story. 

They took the trouble to express my regards to Baba, and on doing so, Baba 
Himself namaskared with His hands, and then said, 

"Hmm. Dharmapala... Just see, just see. Though my boys and my girls are 
not yet perfectly following 16 Points, the immoralists are afraid of them, and 
literally shake in fear. 40 

"But when my boys and my girls really adhere to 76 Points" He continued, 
"the bones of the immoralists will shake. You understand?" 

He jabbed at His own thigh, smiling broadly, saying, "The very bone will 
shake."
