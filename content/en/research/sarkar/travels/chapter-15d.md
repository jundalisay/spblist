The treatment that Baba gave to Keshava from Germany was peculiar. 

After the General Secretary took Keshava through a typical set of questions &  answers about 16 Points, Baba proceeded to speak to him in Sanskrit. Keshava didn't mind; he understands very little English anyhow. Some of the Indian workers who could understand Sanskrit said that Baba was speaking about the law of action and reaction. 

At the end of the session, Baba took Keshava's head  in His hands, and, rubbing it affectionately, said in English:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
My poor boy ... my poor boy 
{{< /l >}}


No one could understand the meaning of this, including Keshava. 

Nevertheless, Keshava was so inspired he decided to go for acharya training. 


{{< f f="Author's note: Keshava became an acharya, and then an avadhuta with the  name Gunaragananda. In 1991, I spoke again to Gunaraga-nandaji about his dharma samiksha. His bewilderment about the meaning of Baba's words 'my poor boy' was apparently resolved when he had a serious car accident while in the Sweden acharya training center. He nearly died in the accident, and needed many months to recover. Severe scars remained. I say 'apparently resolved' because a few years later, as an acharya, he had another accident in a car in Venezuela, in which the car flipped over several times, killing the driver. Gunaraganandaji was thrown a few meters away from the vehicle, even though  he had been sitting in the back of the two-door car. Again it took months for  him to get back on his feet. Hardly had he recovered when there was another incident. This time it was in Ananda Nagar, where he wandered into the jungle far away from our central quarters, fell asleep after doing meditation, and was attacked by tribal people. They stabbed him repeatedly and stole the little money he had. He told me, 'Baba's words in dharma samiksha helped me to keep going  ahead even during these worst experiences. I accepted the suffering as a part of my spiritual path. I believe that during dharma samiksha Baba foresaw my death, and changed it into a series of accidents, which  allowed me to go on working for the mission." >}}
 

<!-- Not your fault  -->

American Brother G stood in front of Baba. After some personal talk, Baba said:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Your mind is unnecessarily disturbed about the past. You made some mistakes of a sexual nature.
{{< /l >}}

G's face suddenly became very red. 

{{< r a="G" >}}
"Yeah ... yes, Baba
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
When you were younger you had some misunderstanding about the relationship between men and women." "But it was not your fault. As a little boy you were simply influenced by your environment.
{{< /l >}}


G looked up at Baba. He sighed deeply, smiled slightly and said, "Thank you, Baba." 

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
No need of thanks. I merely convey to you the unadulterated facts. You were unaware. Unaware.
{{< /l >}}

G approached me after the session, wanting to get something off his chest. 

{{< r a="G" >}}
I never told anyone but since you were present today, I want to tell you that... that before joining Ananda Marga, I had ... improper sexual relations.

Even though I've been doing meditation for a number of years, it's always bothered me; I've always felt guilty. But now Baba's freed my mind. 

When He said it wasn't my  fault, something let go inside me. I feel so light now; I wouldn't be surprised if 
I started to fly!

Another episode from dharma samiksha: 

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Throughout your life you have had one obsession, one greatest fear. What is it? 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Margi" >}}
Ah ... (apparently confused and unable to reply) 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
In your previous life you were a priest of common status. Your duty kept you fixed at one temple.

You often thought:
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Margi" >}}
How can the idol I worship be God? God cannot be limited to a statue. So how can I find God?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
You studied and searched for the answer. But one morning, a snake bit you as you were picking flowers to offer to the goddess. 

Lying in the grass, in great pain, you thought:
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Margi" >}}
If there is a God He must save me. Or at least He must properly guide me in my next life.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Thinking that, you died. That is why you are here today. That is why you feared snakes so much that you even imagined snakes where they were not. But from today, that fear will no longer trouble you. 

Now, my boy, are you satisfied? 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Margi" >}}
(smiling): Yes, Baba. Very very much. 
{{< /r >}}


### My Dharma Samiksha 

I stood before Baba for my own dharma samiksha. Baba commented:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
He has some sincerity, but it was better before.
{{< /l >}}

I was mystified by this statement. 

While analyzing my physical condition. He said:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
There is weakness in your Vishuddha Chakra.
{{< /l >}}

<!-- 73 The fifth chakra, located in the center of throat  -->

The asanas He prescribed were almost completely different from what I had expected.

This was because I gave little importance a minor operation I had on my knees when I was 16 years old, and to some weakness in my waistâ€”but it seems Baba considered these defects to be critical. 

<!-- The most beautiful element of my session, however, was something I am unable to adequately describe. It was how He looked at me and how He  touched me.

His eyes penetrated far into my soul. 

From that moment until even now as I record this memory, I have been feeling an extraordinary sort of 
ecstasy. Toward the end, He embraced me in such a way that every cell in my 
body burned with excitement. 

I lost consciousness of everything except Baba Himself. I was so happy that my mind stopped functioning except for the 
thought Baba, Baba, Baba.  -->

<!-- I'm not sure how long I had been sitting in His lap, when I suddenly became aware of someone pulling me off of Baba, saying:

"Come on, others are waiting, you know."  -->

I fell into prostration in front of  Him, and then had a hard time struggling to stand up because my mind was almost out of touch with my body. 


{{< f f="Author's note: Years later I add 2 comments in retrospect. First, I still cannot understand what He meant by my being better before. Did He mean my meditation, my dynamism, my devotion, my work, all these things, or something else? I don't know. In any case the effect of His words is that I always feel like I do not express my full potentiality, no matter how much I try and no matter what I do. And yet I don't feel any inferiority complex because Baba did not compare me with anyone else, only with my previous self. Thus His comment has never stopped pushing me. Second, though I had no recognizable trouble with my throat before my dharma samiksha, I have often had problems with it ever since. J">}}
 


### Filipino Dada A

Filpino Dada A received dharma samiksha. 

When Baba referred to A's secret weakness, he became so agitated that he soiled himself. 

All of the Dadas in the room saw a little bit of his diarrhea drip onto the floor. I suppose he had stomach trouble, and could not control himself. 

Baba's personal assistant, Dada Ramananda, said quietly in Bengali, "Baba, the boy soiled himself." 

But Baba seemed not to hear. He went on dealing with Dada A. 

After a minute, the General Secretary said something similar to Baba. 

Again Baba paid no attention. Some of us whispered between ourselves. But Baba continued, unruffled. 

When at last He took Dada A upon His lap and lovingly hugged him to His breast, Ramanandaji spoke again in Bengali to Baba about the feces. 

Baba lost His smile, and replied in Bengali:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
"What? Why didn't you tell me before? Immediately clean up the floor! He must not stay here another moment! Nasty, nasty!" 
{{< /l >}}

Two Dadas pulled Dada A out of the room, though he didn't care-not only because he hadn't understood the Bengali, but also because Baba had finished the dharma samiksha, and blessed Dada A with His embrace. 

Rather Dada A was so ecstatic, he must have been unaware of his own dirtiness. 

We all laughed into our hands. I loved Him even more for pretending not to hear until the session was finished.
