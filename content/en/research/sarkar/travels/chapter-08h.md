<!-- I want to add something more still about Baba's incomparable . For this purpose I take the liberty to quote from 
an article by  -->

Dada Sarveshvarananda, a previous General Secretary, writes about Baba's ability to 
alternatively love and scold us: 

Baba was as strong as thunder in dealing with evil or immoral actions on the one hand, and as tender as a flower bud in dealing with righteous or moral actions on the other. Actually, I never felt Baba's anger was in any sense like that of an ordinary person. Usually if someone loses his temper, his blood pressure rises, his face turns red and he loses all mental equilibrium. But Baba was always in control of Himself. He would show anger and displeasure to make us realize our faults and goad us on towards inner and outer perfection. I always felt that He was playing a role with His anger for us because, in the next moment. He could be light-hearted again — laughing and making us 
laugh.... 

Truly, we were not so unnerved by His anger as one might expect. 

Even though that anger blew through us like a devastating storm, we knew that soothing rainfall was sure to follow. The severity of the prolonged reproofs and condemnation we had to face during our reporting sessions, pierced through our minds like arrows and made us completely heartbroken. We would then be hopelessly rejected. But when the reporting was over, He would change 
completely. 

He would call us and shower loving caresses and sweet, calming words on us. This love, this affection, was so sublime and touching that all the humiliation, dejection and agonies we were experiencing a moment before were instantly gone. ... Baba once said to me, "No matter how high a position a person attains, he or she will always need a strict guardian to answer to for his 
or her deeds — good or bad — who will give him or her proper guidance in 
life's journey. 

That guardian will also be a perennial source of inspiration. That is why I have a responsibility to be very strict in my discipline and duties. But it is not my real nature. My 
responsibilty compels me, against my wish, to be harsh with you." Infinite 
affection was His real nature. What we saw in the way of anger and fury was 
nothing but a camouflage to an inner ocean of love and affection for all.... 

Further, here's a story of Dada Tapeshvarananda: 

In 1984 I was a Central worker. During a few days that the General 
Secretary was absent, I had the duty to give most of the reports to Baba. In the 
collective sessions. Baba gave me terrible punishment, as if the whole blame of 
the organization's defects was mine. 

After one punishment I felt so wounded, both physically and mentally, that I 
wanted to distance myself from Him. I decided I would-not sing Prabhat 
Samgiit, and that I would do only organizational work, since that was all He 
seemed to care about. 

So that night when Baba returned from fieldwalk, I intentionally avoided 
Him. and was not there for singing together with everyone else. I heard that 
Baba asked, "Where is Tapeshvarananda?" 

Someone answered, "Baba, he was just here, but maybe he is busy 
somewhere." 

After eating His dinner. He called me. I could not avoid, and had to go to 
His room. I did not look at Baba, and kept my eyes down while I answered His 
questions. 

He asked, "How did you like that song I gave yesterday, Tumi amar 
dhyaner dhyeyol Did you learn it?" I was silent. 

"You cannot remember?" 

"No, Baba, I did not learn it." 

"Whatever you remember, even one or two lines, you sing." Then I could not 
control my tears, and started crying. I said, "Baba, I did not learn the song, I 
cannot remember any line." "Why?" I could not reply. 

He said. "You see, I understand, you may feel that I only punish you. I only 
torture you. But you don't understand that when I am punishing you. my inner 
intention is not to torture you. but to purify you. You may feel externally that it 
is torture, that it is humiliation. But spiritual purification comes after suffering, 
torture and humiliation. 


"The main enemy on the spiritual path is ego, and ego can be powedered 
only through these three processes of suffering, torture and humiliation. You 
may feel bad, but you don't know how happy I am when I see that you are 
successfully passing all these sufferings and tortures, because bliss and the 
supreme Ananda comes only after that. Ultimately in the spiritual world, 
nothing is suffering. There is only you moving toward the spiritual bliss. 

"Do you know why I asked you about that song? The last line says, 'I am 
weeping. Is that what You want? If that gives You pleasure, then I will go on 
weeping only for You."' 

So after this big build-up about Baba's stricness, let's turn to what really 
happened today:J 

I had heard stories about reporting sessions before Baba, the punishment 
He metes out to his workers and the countless displays of His spiritual power 
and love; today I had my first real taste during a session with the education 
department. 

The drama went as follows: 

GENERAL SECRETARY [GS]: How many schools were started last month 
in your region? 

RANCHI REGIONAL SECRETARY. Three, Dada. 

BABA: Why only three? How many of your diocese secretaries are present 
here? 

REG. SECY.: Four, Baba. 

BABA (frowning and squinting): Then why not four schools? Nonsense, 
rascal. Who is the worker that didn't start a school? 

DIOCESE SECRETARY (stepping forward uneasily): Myself, Baba. 

BABA: Is there any justification for such gross inefficiency? 

DIO. SECY, (stammering): I try...tried my my best. Baba. 

BABA: Tried! Stupid. One does or does not do. To sincerely try is to do. 
So no need to keep the word try in your dictionary. Ranchi regional secretary, 
come forward! (The reg. secy, steps in front of Baba.) Due to your inadequate 
supervision, this jewel-of-a-boy's potentiality was not fully utilized. Hands up! 
(The reg. secy, lifts both arms straight up.) Animal! Only eating and sleeping! 
(Baba hits His stick against his side. The reg. secy, jumps up involuntarily.) 
Wasting your time and misguiding your workers.(Baba beats a him bit more, as the reg. secy, mutters 
"Baba Baba" and leaps from side to side.) 

DIO. SECY, (moving closer to Baba): No, don't beat him, Baba! It's my 
fault. 

BABA (pausing with the stick and speaking in a calm, dignified manner): 
No. it's not your fault. It is due to your supervisor. (He turns to the reg. secy, 
and strikes him again.) Idiot, lazy fellow! 

REG. SECY, (speaking to the dio. secy.): Say something concrete! 

DIO. SECY.: Baba, I'll start a school within one month. 

BABA (hits the reg. secy, again): One month! One month! Do you think 
that the suffering humanity can wait for such listlessness and lethargy? 

DIO. SECY.: One week. Baba! I'll start the school within one week! BABA 
(halting with the stick): Did you hear what the boy said, GS? GENERAL 
SECY: Yes, Baba. He said he will start a school in one week. 

BABA (taking out a handkerchief to wipe the sweat from His brow): Yes, 
take a note. If a school is not started within one week, then further measures 
will be required. 

REG. SECY.: Baba, I will properly supervise him. 

BABA: Yesss... 

Surely most people would be horrified to see such a display of anger and 
force. But I was full of inspiration. Here was a man-making guru, capable of 
molding His disciples for the benefit of society. 

After leaving the room, the RS joked and laughed, his face suffused with 
joy, though the marks of the stick were still visible. It made me even more 
curious to know the inner effect of His stick.
