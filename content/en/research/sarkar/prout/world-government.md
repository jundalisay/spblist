A world government is necessary to materialize the concept of universalism. It should be a confederation of all the federated states of the world. 

These federated states will consist of self-sufficient economic units or zones formed entirely on socio-economic and geographical considerations.

Economically-developed areas have a tendency to exploit economically undeveloped areas. This is why federated states should be formed of different units. 

An example inside India is Vidarbhga, a Marathi-speaking area. It does not want to remain a part of Maharasthra. It wants to become a separate state.

Another important example is Azarbaizan. 

The Persian portion of Azarbaizan agitated to merge with the Soviet portion of Azarbaizan to ensure economic development. 

The different units or zones formed in this way may be redefined and renamed for administrative convenience. 

These units may have certain common factors. These common factors will unite them into federations.

In the initial stage, the world government will be a law-making body. 

The different federations will have executive powers to implement the laws passed by the world government. 

The federations may or may not fully materialize the laws of the confederation. But they must not go against them. 

The confederation will, however, have some executive power for limited and defined purposes for:
- maintaining inter-federal peace and tranquillity 
- settling inter-planetary disputes. 

This will mean the maintenance of a world militia under the full control of the confederation.

The federation and the units will also maintain a police force to ensure internal law and order. 

The economic units or zones will have dictatorial boards. 

These boards will form one higher board, which will be called federated boards. 

These federated boards will govern the different federations. The collection of these federated boards is called the confederated board or body. 

This body will look after the confederation as a whole, but will not ignore the interests of any federation.
