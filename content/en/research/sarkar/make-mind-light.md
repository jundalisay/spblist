According to the standard of intellect, microcosms can be divided into 3 broad categories:

1. Brutes
2. Humans
3. Devatas [gods]

In human society, we find:
- brutes in human structure
- humans in human structure
- devatas in human structure.

What is our sadhana?  What is our intuitional practice? 

Sadhana is a march:
- from the stratum of brutality to the stratum of humanity, and
- from the stratum of humanity to the stratum of divinity.

This divine person becomes one with the Supreme Lord.

That particular point where the devata merges with the Supreme Lord is the terminating point of all the marches in one's life.

So it is a march, something dynamic.  In human life, one must not support or encourage the static principle.

Dynamicity is the law and the order of human life.


### Rohita

In ancient times, there was a great pandit (scholar) named Rohita.  He was well-versed in all the shastras (scriptures).
- `Shas` means 'to control" to do shasana
- `tra` means 'liberator" 

That which liberates you by controlling all your activities -- 'Don't do this, do that" -- through this sort of control -- is shastra. 

It liberates you by auto-suggestion.  Auto-suggestion means mantra, incantation.  

{{< q >}}
Mananat trayet yastu sah mantrah parikiirtitah. ["A mantra is that collection of sounds which, when meditated upon, leads to liberation"].
{{< /q >}}


After returning from his gurugrha [the master's house], his biological father asked him to do worldly duties.

{{< l a="Rohita" >}}
Oh, I went through so many shastras. I have concluded that there is no need to do any work.  We shouldn't do any work.  We should always be engaged in jinanacara (cultivation of spiritual knowledge].
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Father" >}}
Oh Rohita, he who moves forward, he who has developed the dynamic force in his body and mind, is really blessed. 

The sweating body of that industrious person is the most beautiful body.

That perspiring body has world-attracting charm. Indra, the lord of the devatas, always tries to make friendship with the industrious person.

<!-- So, Rohita, move forward, move forward, move forward.   -->

Life is a dynamic force.

'If someone does not do anything, any work; if someone is afraid of work, then his fortune is sleeping.   If someone is intellectually and physically sleeping, then his or her fate is also sleeping.

But if someone wants to do something, then his or her fate also wants to move forward. 
{{< /r >}}


{{< r a="Father" >}}
If someone is standing, then his or her fate is also standing.  If someone moves forward, then his or her fate also moves forward.  So Rohita do something. "

'When you are sleeping in the slumber of ignorance, there is Kali Yuga in your life. If someone feels that he should do something, there is Dvapara Yuga in his or her life.  

If someone becomes ready to do something, there is Treta Yuga in his life.  If someone has started doing something, doing sadhana, there is Satya Yuga in his or her life.

So Rohita, do something.  Life is a constant effort to restore an unstable equilibrium.  Life is a fight.  Life is moving forward.  Life is a dynamic force."

<!-- This human life is a movement from the stage of brute to the stage of humanity, from the stage of humanity to the stage of divinity, and from the stage of divinity to merger with the Supreme Lord.

This is life.  This is your intuitional practice. This is your sadhana. -->

When you are to move fast, your mind should be light. If the mind is heavy, it will not be able to move fast.


The mind is made heavy by so many impurities of thought. Lord Buddha said:


{{< q a="Buddha" >}}
Sinca bhikkhu imam nabam sitta te lahu messati. Muinca re muinca pacchata majjhe muinca bhabassa

Remove all the water from the boat of your body. Being free from water, it will become very light.

Give up everything that lies ahead, everything that lies behind, and everything that lies in the middle. Go to the other side of the world.

You should make your mind light. You should give up all worldly thoughts, all base thoughts, all depraving thoughts, and make yourself light.
{{< /q >}}


To make oneself light means to free oneself from impurities.  

A magnet can easily attract a piece of iron. But if that piece of iron is full of impurities, that very magnet may not be able to attract it.

So the Supreme Self, the Supreme Lord, is always attracting you. But because of your heaviness, due to worldly impurities, you are not being attracted by the Lord.


### How to Free the Mind

<!-- How does one free the mind and make it light? How does one free the mind from worldly impurities?  -->

The mind is freed by rendering selfless service to suffering humanity without any restriction of caste, creed, religion, or sex.  

So, as sadhakas [spiritual aspirants], you must remember that the dharma of your life is to move forward from matter to abstract, from abstract to soul, and from soul to the Supreme Soul. 

This is the dharma of your life. While performing this dharma, you are to render selfless service to all humanity.

You must not forget this fact.

If you are successful in rendering selfless service to the world, certainly you will make progress in your spiritual life.

Shubhamastu ["May everything be auspicious for you"].
