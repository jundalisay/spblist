We see here that the mean place of the Sun from opposition to the apparent place of Mars in the ecliptic can sometimes be 13 and ½ minutes apart, which is almost three times what could be erred through the displacement of the hypothesis. Therefore, the certainty of these hypotheses did not constrain me from seeking another.

But they admitted this discrepancy on purpose, as is evident from the fact that since the nodes are about 17 gr. ४, and the limits about 17 gr. 2, as will be said below, additions and subtractions were made principally in 17 gr. 65, 25 gr., 4 gr. m, 27 gr. 4, 13 gr. x, the intermediate places being left untouched: none in 21 gr. 2, 18 gr. m, the nodes and the limit. Therefore, their reason was that they thought the Planet did not depart from the second inequality unless the Sun had moved away from the node only as much as the Planet in its orbit. Yet this was not a fixed principle. For according to this idea of theirs, the variation ought to have been greatest in 3 gr., because it is nearest to the 45th degree, where this variation is usually greatest. But in 17 gr. 6 they subtracted 5 minutes, and in 3 gr. only 1 minute. The reason for this will be explained in another table that follows, comparing the places (reduced to the orbit of Mars) with the mean places for these moments.
