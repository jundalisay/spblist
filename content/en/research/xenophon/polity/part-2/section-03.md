A boy ceases to be a boy and becomes a youth in a critical period. At this point, the rest of the world proceeds to emancipate their children from the private tutor and the schoolmaster and launch them into absolute independence. 

<!-- Without substituting any further ruler, they are content to . -->

<!--  (1) {eis to meirakiousthai}, "with reference to hobbledehoy-hood."
    Cobet erases the phrase as post-Xenophontine. -->


Here, again, Lycurgus took an entirely opposite view. 

<!-- This, if observation might be trusted, was the season  -->

That period is when:
- the tide of animal spirits flows fast, and 
  - the most violent appetites for diverse pleasures, in serried ranks, invade the mind
- the froth of insolence rises to the surface


This, then, was the right moment to:
- impose tenfold labours on the growing youth, and
- devise a subtle system of absorbing occupation for him. 

Lycurgus made a crowning enactment: 

"he who shrank from the duties imposed on him would forfeit henceforth all claim to the glorious honours of the state" 

This caused both the public authorities and those personally interested (3) in the several companies of youths to take serious pains so that no single one of them would find himself utterly rejected within the body politic.

<!-- by an act of craven cowardice  and reprobate politic. -->

<!--  (2) Lit. "range themselves." For the idea, see "Mem." I. ii. 23;
    Swinburne, "Songs before Sunrise": Prelude, "Past youth where
    shoreward shallows are."

 (3) Or, "the friends and connections." -->

In his desire to implant in their youthful souls a root of modesty, he imposed on these bigger boys a special rule. 

In the very streets they were to keep their 2 hands (4) within the folds of the cloak. They were to walk in silence and without turning their heads to gaze, now here, now there, but rather to keep their eyes fixed on the ground before them. 

This proved that, even in the matter of quiet bearing and sobriety, (5) the masculine type is stronger than women. 

You might sooner expect a stone image to find voice than one of those Spartan youths; to divert the eyes of some bronze stature were less difficult. 

And as to quiet bearing, no bride ever stepped in bridal bower (6) with more natural modesty. Note them when they have reached the public table. (7) The plainest answer to the question asked—that is all you need expect to hear from their lips.


<!--  (6) Longinus, {peri ups}, iv. 4, reading {ophthalmois} for     {thalamois}, says: "Yet why speak of Timaeus, when even men like     Xenophon and Plato, the very demigods of literature, though they
    had sat at the feet of Socrates, sometimes forget themselves in
    the pursuit of such pretty conceits? The former in his account of
    the Spartan Polity has these words: 'Their voice you would no more
    hear, than if they were of marble, their gaze is as immovable as
    if they were cast in bronze. You would deem them more modest than
    the very maidens in their eyes.' To speak of the pupils of the
    eyes as modest maidens was a piece of absurdity becoming
    Amphicrates rather than Xenophon; and then what a strange notion
    to suppose that modesty is always without exception, expressed in
    the eye!"—H. L. Howell, "Longinus," p. 8. See "Spectator," No.
    354.
