[What is here to be understood by affections.] Now that the nature of being, insofur as it is being, has been explained, we pass on to the explanation of some of its affections. It should be noted that by affections we here understand what elsewhere, in Art. 52 Part I Prine. Philosoph., Descartes has termed attributes. For being, insofar as it is being, does not affect us through itself alone, as substance, and
has therefore to be explained through some attribute, from which, however, it is
distinguished only by reason. Hence I cannot suffiCiently wonder at the subtlety
of mind of those who have sought, not without great harm to truth, something that
is between being and nothing. But I shall waste no time in refuting their error, because they themselves, in struggling to provide definitions of such affections, disappear from sight in their own vain subtlety.
[Definition of affections. ] We shall therefore continue on our way, and we say 
Appendix Containing Metaphysical Thoughts, Part I, Chapter 3 183
that the affections of being are certain attributes under which we understand the
essence or existence of each individual thing, although these attributes are distinguished from the thing only by reason. I shall here attempt to explain some of
these affections (for I do not undertake to deal with them all) and to set them apart
from those designations that are not affections of any being. And in the first place
I shall deal with the Necessary and the Impossible.
[In how many ways a thing is said to be necessary or impossible. ] There are two
ways in which a thing is said to be necessary or impossible, either with respect to
its essence or with respect to its cause. With respect to essence we know that God
necessarily exists, for his essence cannot be conceived without existence; whereas,
with respect to the contradiction involved in its essence, a chimera is incapable
of existence. With respect to cause, things (e.g., material things) are said to be either impossible or necessary. For if we have regard only to their essence, we can
conceive that clearly and distinctly without existence; therefore they can never exist through the force and necessity of their essence, but only through the force of
their cause, God, the creator of all things. So if it is in the divine decree that a
thing should exist, it will necessarily exist; if not, it will be impossible for it to
exist. For it is self-evident that if a thing has no cause for existence-either an internal or an external cause- it is impossible for it to exist. Now in this second hypothesis a thing is supposed to be such that it cannot exist either by force of its
own essence-which I understand to be an internal cause-or by force of the divine decree, the unique external cause of all things. Hence it follows that it is impossible for things, as we suppose them to be in the second hypothesis, to exist.
[A Chimera is properly called a verbal being.] Here it should be noted that: I.
Because a chimera is neither in the intellect nor in the imagination, we may properly call it a verbal being, for it can be expressed only in words. For example, we
can express a square circle in words, but we cannot in any way imagine it, far less
understand it. Therefore a chimera is nothing but a word; and so impossibility
cannot be counted among the affections of being, for it is mere negation.
[Created things depend on God for their essence and existence. ] 2. Not only the
existence of created things but also, as we shall later on demonstrate with the greatest certainty in Part 2, their essence and their nature depend solely on God's decree. Hence it clearly follows that created things have no necessity of themselves;
for they have no essence of themselves, nor do they exist of themselves.
[The necessity that is in created things from their cause is either of essence or of
existence; but these two are not distinguished in God. ] 3. Finally, the necessity such
as is in created things by virtue of their cause is so called either with respect to
their essence or with respect to their existence; for these two are distinct in created things, the former depending on the eternal laws of nature, the latter on the
series and order of causes. But in God, whose essence is not distinguished from
his existence, the necessity of essence is likewise not distinguished from the necessity of existence. Hence it follows that if we were to conceive the entire order
of nature, we should find that many things whose nature we clearly and distinctly
perceive- that is, whose essence is necessarily such as it is-could in no way exist. For we should find that the existence of such things in nature is just as much 
184 Principles of Cartesian Philosophy
impossible as we now see it to be impossible that a huge elephant should pass
through the eye of a needle, although we clearly perceive the nature of both.
Hence the existence of those things would be only a chimera, which we could
neither imagine nor understand.
[The Possible and the Contingent are not affections of things. ] So much for necessity and impossibility, to which I have thought it advisable to add a few remarks concerning the possible and the contingent. For these two are regarded by
some as affections of things, whereas they are in fact nothing but a failure of our
intellect, as I shall clearly show when I explain what is to be understood by these
two terms.
[What is the Possible, and what the Contingent. ] A thing is said to be possible
when we understand its efficient cause but do not know whether the cause is determined. Hence we can also consider it as possible, but not as either necessary or
impossible. But if we attend simply to the essence of the thing and not to its cause,
we shall call the thing contingent, that is, we shall consider it as midway between
God and a chimera, so to speak, because on the side of essence we find in it no necessity to exist1 as in the case of the divine essence, nor again any inconsistency or
impossibility, as in the case of a chimera. Now if anyone wishes to call contingent
what I call possible, or possible what I call contingent, I shall not oppose him, for
it is not my custom to argue about words. It will be enough ifhe grants us that these
two are only the defect of our perception, and not anything real.
[The Possible and the Contingent are only the defect of our intellect. ] If anyone
wishes to deny this, his error can be demonstrated to him with no trouble. For if
he attends to nature and the way it depends on God, he will find nothing contingent in things, that is, nothing that can either exist or not exist on the part of
the thing, or is a real contingency, as it is commonly called. This is readily apparent from our teaching in Axiom 10 Part I, to wit, that the same force is required
in creating a thing as in preserving it. So no created thing affects anything by its
own force, just as no created thing began to exist by its own force. From this it follows that nothing happens except by the power of the all-creating cause-that is,
God-who by his concurrence at every moment continues to create all things.
Now because nothing happens except by the divine power alone, it is easy to see
that those things that happen do so by the force of God's decree and will. But because there is in God no inconstancy or variability (by Prop. 18 and Cor. Prop.
20 Part I ), he must have resolved from eternity to produce those things that he is
now producing. And because nothing has a more necessary existence than that
which God has decreed should exist, it follows that the necessity to exist has been
from eternity in all created things. Nor can we say that those things are contingent because God could have decreed otherwise. For because in eternity there is
no when or before or after or any affection of time, it follows that God never existed prior to those decrees so as to be able to decree otherwise. 3

[To reconcile the freedom of our will with God's predestination surpasses human
understanding. ] As to the freedom of the human will, which we asserted to be free
in Schol. Prop. 15 Part I, this too is preserved by the concurrence of God, nor
does any man will or perform anything except what God has decreed from eternity that he should will or perform. How this can be while saving human freedom
is beyond our capacity to understand. Yet we must not reject what we clearly perceive because of what we do not know, for if we attend to our nature, we clearly
and distinctly understand that we are free in our actions, and that we reach decisions on many th ings simply on account of our will to do so. Again, if we attend
to the nature of God, as we have just shown, we clearly and distinctly perceive that
all things depend on him, and that nothing exists except that whose existence God
has decreed from eternity. But how the human will continues to be created by
God at every moment in such a way as to remain free, we do not know. For there
are many things that exceed our grasp and that nevertheless we know to have been
brought about by God-for example, the real division of matter into indefinite
particles, clearly demonstrated by us in Prop. 11 Part 2, although we do not know
how that division comes about.
Note that we here take for granted that those two notions, the possible and the
contingent, signify merely the defectiveness of our knowledge regarding the existence of a thing.
