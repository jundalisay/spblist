How a community governed as a Monarchy or Aristocracy should be organised as to not degenerate into a Tyranny.

<!-- , and if the Peace and Freedom of its citizens is to remain inviolate. -->

<!-- CHAPTER 1 -->

<!-- [Introduction ] 1

[I]  -->

{{< s v="1" >}} Philosophers look at the vices and deride, berate, and execrate them.

They believe:
- that they are thus performing a sacred duty.
- that they are wisest when they have learnt how to:
  - shower extravagant praise on a human nature that does not exist
  - revile the actual human nature.

They conceive men not as they are, but as they would like them to be.

As a result, they have written about satire and not ethics. 

They have never worked out a practical political theory.

 <!-- that can have practical application, only one that borders on fantasy or could be put into effect in Utopia or in that golden age of the poets where there would naturally be no need of such. -->

Therefore:
- theory is at variance with practice in all practical sciences, especially in political theory.
- theoreticians or philosophers are the least fit for governing a state


{{< s v="2" >}} Statesmen, on the other hand, are believed to aim at men's undoing rather than their welfare.

They have a reputation for cunning rather than wisdom.

There will be vices as long as there are men. 

Politicians seek to anticipate human wickedness. They employ arts which:
- they have learnt from long experience and which men 
- men habitually practise when guided by fear rather than by reason

Politicians appear to be the enemies of religion, especially to theologians. 
- Theologians believe that sovereign powers should deal with public affairs according to the same moral principles as are binding on the private individual. 

Yet statesmen, guided by experience, have written about political matters much more effectively than philosophers. 

<!-- For since experience has been their guide, there is nothing they have taught that is remote from practice. -->

Chapter 1 68 1 -->


{{< s v="3" >}} Experience has revealed every conceivable form of commonwealth' where men may live in harmony, and also the means whereby a people may be governed or restrained within fixed bounds. 

So I do not believe that our researches in this field can lead us to anything not at variance with experience and practice that has not already been discovered and tried.

<!-- For human nature is such that  -->

Men cannot live without some common code of law. Such codes have been instituted and public affairs conducted by men of considerable intelligence, both astute and cunning. 

So it is hardly credible that we can conceive anything of possible benefit to the community that opportunity or chance has not already suggested and that men engaged in public affairs and concerned for their own security have not already discovered.


{{< s v="4" >}} Therefore, I do not propose anything totally new. 

 <!-- in turning my attention to political theory it was not my purpose to suggest anything that is novel or unheard of, but only to demonstrate by sure and conclusive reasoning such  -->

Instead I will demonstrate the things as are in closest agreement with practice, deducing them from human nature as it really is. 

<!-- In order to enquire into matters relevant to this branch of knowledge in the same unfettered spirit as is habitually shown in mathematical studies,  -->

I have taken great care not to deride or execrate human actions, but to understand them. 

So I have regarded human emotions such as love, hatred, anger, envy, etc. not as vices, but as its properties in the same way as heat, cold, storm, thunder, etc. pertain to the nature of the atmosphere. 

 <!-- pride, pity, and other agitations of the mind not as vices of human nature  -->

These things, though troublesome, are inevitable. They have definite causes.

 <!-- through which we try to understand their nature. And  -->

<!-- The mind derives as much enjoyment in contemplating them aright as from the knowledge of things that are pleasing to the senses. -->



{{< s v="5" >}} Men are:
- necessarily subject to passions
- so constituted that they pity the unfortunate, envy the fortunate, and are more inclined to vengeance than to compassion.

Furthermore, each man wants others to live according to his way of thinking, approving what he approves and rejecting what he rejects. 

Consequently, since all men want preeminence, they fall to quarrelling.
 <!-- and strive their utmost to best one another. -->

He who emerges victorious is more elated at having hindered someone else than at having gained an advantage for himself, even if religion teaches that each should love his neighbour as himself.

<!-- , that is, that he should uphold another's right just as his own, we have shown that this conviction is of little avail  -->


<!-- [The allUsion is to Machiavelli, who also argued that the principles of public morality are not the same as those of individual ethics.]

[The Latin civitas is usually rendered "commonwealth" in what follows.]
 -->
<!-- 5 [extra commune aliquod jU8. TIlls IS the rust tIme Spmo:za uses the term jus, a very difficult term to
render mto the modern Idiom. In what follows, jus IS usually rendered as "law" or "righf' depending on the sense and context of the passage III which It IS used 1 against the passions.  -->

Such a Golden Rule is effective:
- when a person is near death -- when sickness has subdued the passions and a man lies helpless
- in places of worship where men have no dealings with one another

But it has no weight in law-court or palace, where it would be needed most of all. 

Reason can do much to control and moderate the passions.

But at the same time, the path taught by reason is very difficult. Those who believe that ordinary people can be persuaded to live solely according to reason are dreaming.

<!-- or those who are busily engaged in public business  -->



<!--  of
the poets' golden age or of a fairy tale. -->

{{< s v="6" >}} A state will be unstable if its safety depends on some man's good faith.

<!-- , and its affairs cannot be properly administered unless those responsible for them are willing to act in good faith, that state will lack all stability.  -->

An enduring state will have its government organised so that its ministers cannot be induced to betray their trust or to act basely, whether they are guided by reason or passion. 

The state does not need to care what motives induce men to administer its affairs properly, provided that its affairs are in fact properly administered.

<!-- Nor does it matter for the security of the state what  -->


The virtue of:
- a private citizen: is freedom of spirit or strength of mind
- a state is its security


{{< s v="7" >}} All men, whether barbarian or civilised, enter into relationships with each other and set up some kind of civil order.

The causes of the state are not found in reason.
- They are deduced from the nature and condition of men in general.

<!-- One should not look for the causes and natural foundations of the state in the teachings of reason, but deduce them  -->


<!-- This I propose to do in the next chapter.  -->
