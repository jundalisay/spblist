[I J Since men, as we have said, are led more by passion than by reason , it naturally follows that a people will unite and consent to be guided as if by one mind not at reason's prompting but through some common emotion, such as (as we said
in Section 9, Chapter 3) a common hope, or common fear, or desire to avenge some common injury. Now since fear of isolation is innate in all men inasmuch as in isolation no one has the strength to defend himself and acquire the necessi5 [dominandi bbidine The connotation IS sexual (see the General OeflDltions of the Affects followIng ElDef48).]

Chapter 6 701
ties ofl ife, it follows that men by nature strive for a civil order,l and it is impossible that men should ever utterly dissolve this order.

[2] Thus the quarrels and rebellions that are often stirred up in a commonwealth never lead to the dissolution of the commonwealth by its citizens (as is often the case with other associations) but to a change in its form- that is, if their
disputes cannot be settled while still preserving the structure of the commonwealth. Therefure, by the means required to preserve a state I understand those
that are necessary to preserve the form of the state without any notable change.

[3] Now ifhuman nature were so constituted that men desired most of all what
was most to their advantage, no special skill would be needed to secure harmony
and trust. But since, admittedly, human nature is far otherwise constituted, the
state must necessarily be so established that all men, both rulers and ruled,
whether they will or no, will do what is in the interests of their common welfare;
that is, either voluntarily or constrained by force or necessity, they will all live as
reason prescribes. Th is comes abou t if the administration of the state is so ordered
that nothing is entrusted absolutely to the good faith of any man . For no man is
so vigilant that he does not sometimes nod, and no one has ever been so resolute
and upright as not sometimes to break down and suffer himself to be overcome
just when strength of mind is most needed. And it is surely folly to make demands
on another that no one can himself satisfy, namely, that he should be more concerned for the interests of another than for his own, that he should avoid greed,
envy, ambition, and so on, especially if he is one who is daily exposed to the
strongest urges of every passion.

[4] Yet on the other hand experience seems to teach us that peace and harmony are best served if all power2 is conferred on one man . For no state has stood
so long without any notable change as that of the Turks, and, conversely, none
have proved so short-lived as popular or democratic states, nor have any been so
liable to frequent rebellion . But if slavery, barbarism, and desolation are to be
called peace, there can be nothing more wretched for mankind than peace.
Doubtless more frequent and more bitter quarrels are wont to arise between parents and children than between masters and slaves. Yet it is not to the advantage
of household management to change paternal right into the right of ownership
and to treat children as ifthey were slaves. It is slavery, then, not peace that is promoted by transferring all power' to one man; for peace, as we have already said,
consists not in the absence of war but in the union or harmony of minds.

[5] And in fac� those who believe that one man by himself can hold the supreme right of the commonwealth are greatly mistaken. For right is determined by power alone, but the power of one man is far from being capable of sustaining
so heavy a load. As a result, the man whom the people has chosen as king looks
about him for generals or counsellors or friends to whom he entrusts his own s&

702 Political Treatise
curity and the security of all citizens, so that the state, which is thought to be
purely a monarchy, is in actual practice an aristocracy- not indeed overtly so, but
a concealed one-and therefore of the worst kind. Furthermore, if the king is a
boy, or a sick man, or burdened by old age, he is a king only on sufferance, and
the sovereignty is really in the hands of those who administer the most important
affairs of state, or of those who are nearest the king; not to mention that a king
who is a slave to lust has all his governmental decisions controlled by the caprice
of one or another concubine or sodomite.' "I had heard;' says Orsines, "that
women once used to rule in Asia: But for a eunuch to rule is really something
new" (Curtius, Book X, Chapter I).

[6] It is also beyond doubt that a commonwealth is always in greater danger
from its citizens than from its enemies; for good men are but few. It therefore follows that he on whom the whole right of the state has been conferred will always
be more afra id of citizens than of external enemies and will therefore endeavour
to look to his own safety, not consulting the interests of his subjects but plotting
against them, especially those who are renowned for their wisdom or whose wealth
gives them too much power.

[7] There is this to be added, that kings fear their sons, too, more than they
love them, and the more so as their sons are more skilled in the arts of peace and
war and are more popular with the subjects because of their virtues. As a result,
kings seek to bring up their sons in a way that removes cause for alarm. In this
matter, his ministers are very zealous in obeying the king, and will make every
effort to have as their next king one who is inexperienced and whom they can
skilfully manipulate.

[8] From all this it follows that the more absolute the transfer of the commonwealth's right to a king, the less he is in control of his own right and the more wretched the condition of his subjects. Thus to establish a monarchy in proper
order, it is necessary to lay firm foundations on which to build, from which would
result security for the monarch and peace for his people, thus ensuring that the
king is most fully in control of his own right when he is most concerned for the
welfare of his people. I shall first briefly set forth what are these foundations for a
monarchy, and then demonstrate them in an orderly way.

[9] One or more cities must be founded and fortified, all of whose citizens,
whether dwelling within the walls or beyond them so as to farm the land, are to
enjoy the same right of citizenship but on this condition: That each city must provide a fixed number of citizens for its own and the common defence. A city that
cannot fulfIl this requirement must be held in subjection on other terms.
[!O] The military force must be recruited from citizens alone, with no exemptions and from no other sources ' So all men are required to possess arms,
and no one is to be admitted to the roll of citizens until he has done his military
tra ining and has undertaken to practise these skills at appointed times of the year.
.. [Possibly a reference to James I of England.J
5 [See Machiavelli, Prince XI I-XI II, and Discourses II, 20.J 
Chapter 6 703
Next, the military force from each clan6 is to be divided into companies and regiments, and no one is to be chosen to command a company unless he is versed in
military engineering 7 Further, while the commanders of companies and regiments are to be appointed for life, the commander of the military force of one entire clan is to be appointed only in wartime, and hold his command for a year at
most, and be debarred from extension of his command or from reelection. The
latter commanders are to be appointed from the king's counsellors (of whom we
are to speak in Section 15 and following), or from ex-counsellors.
[II] The townsmen and countrymen of all the cities,8 that is, all the citizens,
are to be divided into clans distingu ished by some name and badge; and all who
are born of any of these clans are to be received into the number of citizens and
their names entered on the roll of their clans as soon as they reach an age when
they can bear arms and know their duty. But an exception is to be made of those
who are convicted criminals, or dumb, or mad, or menials gaining a livelihood
by some servile occupation.
[ 1 2] The fields and the soil and, if possible, the houses as well should be public property,9 that is, should belong to the sovereign, by whom they should be let
at an annual rent to citizens, whether townsmen or country-dwellers. Apart from
this, all citizens should be free or exempt from any form of taxation in time of
peace. Of this rent, part should be allocated to the defence works of the commonwealth, part to the king's domestic needs. For in time of peace, it is still necessary to fortify cities as for war and to have in a state of readiness ships and other
armaments.
[13] Mter a king has been chosen from one of the clans, none but his descendants are to be regarded as of noble rank, and they must therefore be distinguished
by royal insignia from their own clan and the other clans.
[14] The male nobles related by blood to the reigning king and standing in the
third or fourth degree of consanguinity to him should be forbidden to marry. Any
children they may have should be accounted as illegitimate and unworthy of any
office. They should not be acknowledged as heirs to their parents, whose estates
should revert to the king.
[15] The number of king's counsellors who are nearest to him or second in
rank should be considerable, and they should be chosen only from citizens: Three
or four from each clan, or five if the clans number no more than six hundred. Together they will constitute one section of this council. They are elected not for
life but for three, four, or five years, so that every year a third, fourth, or fifth part
of their number must be appointed afresh. In making these appointments, how6 [familia.]

ever, it is most important that from each clan at least one counsellor should be
chosen who is a lawyer. 1

[16] This selection of counsellors must be made by the king himself. At the
time of 1he year appointed for the election of new counsellors, every clan must
submit to 1he king 1he names of all its citizens who have atta ined 1heir fiftie1h year
and have been duly proposed for 1his office. Of these, 1he king will choose whom
he will. I! But in 1he year when the lawyer of a clan is to be replaced by ano1her,
only 1he names oflawyers should be submitted to 1he king. Those who have served
in this office of counsellor for the appointed time are not to continue in office nor
to be entered on 1he list of candidates within a period of at least five years. The
reason why it is necessary for one counsellor to be appointed from each clan every
year is this: To avoid a situation where the council is composed alternately of inexperienced newcomers and experienced veterans, which is bound to happen if
all the counsellors were to retire and be replaced toge1her. But if one is appoin ted
every year from each clan, then only a fifth, a fourth, or at the most a 1hird of the
council will consist of newcomers. Fur1hermore, if 1he king, through pressure of
o1her business or for any other reason, is prevented for some time from attending
to these appointments, then the counsellors 1hemselves should make temporary
appointments until the king appoints o1hers or approves 1he council's choice.
[17] The primary duty of this council must be to uphold 1he fundamental laws
of 1he state and to give advice on the conduct of affairs so 1hat the king may know
what measures to take for the public good, the king not being permitted to take
any decision without first hearing the opinion of this council. But if, as will generally be the case, 1he council is not of one mind but continues to be divided even
after discussing the same matter two or three times, there must be no fur1her delay; the different opinions must be submitted to the king, as I shall explain in Section 25 of this Chapter.
[18] It should also be 1he duty of the council to publish 1he king's ordinances
or decrees, to see that his decisions on matters of state are carried ou� and to supervise 1he entire administration of 1he state as 1he king's deputies.
[ 19] Citizens should not be able to approach the king except 1hrough 1his council, to which all requests or written petitions should be given for presentation to the
king. Likewise, ambassadors of o1her commonwealths may be granted permission
to address the king only 1hrough 1his council. Letters, too, sent to the king from
o1her kings must reach him 1hrough 1his council. To sum up, the king is to be regarded as the mind of 1he commonweal1h, and this council as 1he mind's external
senses orl2 body of the commonweal1h, through which the mind 13 perceives the
condition of 1he commonweal1h and does what it decides is best for itself.

[20] Responsibility for bringing up the king's sons should also rest with th is
council, and likewise their guardianship if the king has died, leaving the succession to a child or young boy, 14 But in the meantime, to avoid leaving the council
without a king, an elder from among the nobles of the commonwealth should be
appointed to fill the king's place until the rightful heir reaches an age when he
can sustain the burden of government.
[21] Candidates for election to this council must be such as are well acqua inted
with the nature of the government, the fundamental laws, and the state or condition of the commonwealth of which they are subjects. But he who seeks to fill the
position oflawyer must know, in addition to the government and condition of his
own commonwealth, that of other commonwealths with which it has any dealings. But only those who have reached their fiftieth year without any criminal conviction are to be entered on the list of candidates.
[22] In this council no decision is to be taken regarding affairs of state unless
all members are present. If anyone is unable to attend through illness or for any
other reason, he must send in his place someone from the same clan who is an
ex-counsellor or who is entered on the list of candidates. Ifhe fa ils to do this, and
the council is forced to defer consideration of some business because of his absence, he should be fined a considerable sum. But the above should apply only
when the issue to be debated affects the state as a whole, such as a question of war
and peace, of repealing or enacting some law, of trade, etc. If the matter under
discussion concerns just one or two cities, written petitions, etc., it will suffice if
the greater part of the council is present.
[23] To preserve equality between the clans in all things and to establish a regular order in sitting, making proposals, and speaking, each clan is to have its turn
for presiding at the sessions, that which is first at this session being last at the next.
But among members of the same clan, precedence should go to the one who was
first elected.
[24] This council should be summoned at least four times a yearl5 to demand
from ministers an account of their administration, to ascertain the state of affairs,
and to consider whether further measures are called for. For it seems impossible
that so great a number of citizens should be continuously available for public business. But since public business must nevertheless be carried on in the meantime,
fifty or more members of the council should be appointed to stand in for the council when it is adjourned, l6 meeting every day in a chamber next to the king's apartment so as to exercise daily supervision over the treasury, the defences of the cities,
the education of the king's son, and, to sum up, all the duties of the great council that we have just enumerated except that they should have no power to deal
with fresh matters with regard to which no decision has been taken. 17

706 Political Treatise
[25] When the council meets, before any matter is brought forward, five or six
or more lawyers from the clans that take precedence in that session should have
audience with the king to present any written petitions or letters they may have
received, inform him of the condition of affairs, and gather from him what business he requires them to bring forward in this council. When they have learnt this,
they should return to the council, and the first in precedence should open the
matter to be debated. If the matter is thought by some members to be important,
voting must not proceed at once but must be deferred for such time as the urgency
of the matter allows. The council therefore being adjourned to a fixed date, the
counsellors from each clan will meanwhile be able to discuss the matter separately and, if they think it of sufficient importance, to consult ex-<:ounsellors or
candidates for the same council. If within the appointed time they can reach no
agreement among themselves, that clan shall be deprived of its vote, for each clan
can have but one vote. 18 Otherwise the lawyer of the clan, having received his instructions, should present before council the opinion they have judged best. The
others should do likewise, and if, after hearing the grounds for each opinion, the
majority of the council decide to consider the matter further, the council should
again be adjourned to a date when each clan shall deliver its final opinion. Only
then, before a full council, should voting proceed. Any opinion that is not supported by at least a hundred votes should be disregarded; the others should be submitted to the king by all the lawyers presen t at the council so that, after hearing
each party's arguments, he may choose which he pleases. Then the lawyers should
leave him and return to the council, where all should wa it on the king at a time
he has appointed to hear which opinion of those presented he considers should
be adopted and what he decides should be done.
[26] For the administration of justice there must be another council composed
only oflawyers whose duty should be to decide lawsuits and to punish offenders.
But all the judgments they deliver must be confirmed by those acting in place of
the Great Council, which will consider whether judgment has been pronounced
in accord with proper judicial procedure and without partiality. But if the losing
party can prove that one of the judges has been bribed by his adversary, or that he
has some other general reason for friendship towards his adversary or hatred towards himself, or that the normal judicial procedure has not been observed, the
judgment should be set aside. It may be that the above procedures could not be
followed by those whose custom it is to use torture rather than arguments to convict the accused in criminal cases. However, I am not here concerned with any
judicial procedure other than that which befits the good government of a commonwealth.19
[27] These judges, too, should be very many, and their number should be odd:
E.g., sixty-one or fifty-one at least. No more than one judge should be appointed
from each clan, and not for life. Here again some portion of them should retire
1 8 [In tbe Estates of Holland each town had several deputies but only a smgle vote 1
19 [These last two sentences are not included in the Nagelate Schriften 1 
Chapter 6 707
every year and an equal number of others be appointed. These should be from
other clans and should be aged over forty.
[28] In this council no judgment is to be pronounced unless all the judges are
present. If any judge is unable to attend the council for some considerable time,
through illness or for any other reason, another judge should be appointed temporarily to take his place. In voting, each judge must give his verdict not openly
bu t by secret ballot. 20
[29] The remuneration of this council and of the deputies of the above-mentioned council should be as follows- first, the goods of those they have condemned
to death and also of those who are fined; secondly, for every judgment delivered in
civil suits, they should receive from the unsuccessful litigant a proportion of the total sum involved, and this should be for the benefit of both councils.
[ 30] Other councils subordinate to these should be appointed in every city.
Here aga in their members should not be appointed for life, but every year a portion should be appointed only from those clans who dwell in that city. But there
is no need to go further into these details.
[31] No payment for military service is to be made in time of peace. In time of
war a daily payment should be made only to those who ga in their livelihood by
daily labour. But commanders and other company officers should expect no gain
from war other than the spoil of the enemy.
[ 32] If an alien marries the daughter of a citizen, his children are to be regarded
as citizens and enrolled in the mother's clan. Those of alien parentage who are
born and brought up in the state should be allowed to acquire citizenship at a
fixed price from the officers of some clan and to be enrolled in that clan. And even
if the officers of the clan are bribed to admit some alien at less than the fixed price,
the state cannot take any harm therefrom. On the contrary, means should be devised for facilitating an increase in the number of citizens and securing a great influx of population 2l As for those who are not enrolled as citizens, it is reasonable
that at least in wartime they should make up for their exemption from service by
labour or some kind of tax.
[33] Ambassadors who have to be sent in time of peace to other commonwealths to make peace or to preserve it are to be appointed only from the nobles,
and their expenses provided from the state treasury, not from the king's privy
purse.22
[ 34] Those who attend at court and are the king's servants, being paid by the
king from his own privy purse, are to be excluded from every administrative post
20 [Secret balloting was the general procedural rule m Holland J

rendered by Wernham ( 1958, 331) as "But secret agents IIUlst be chosen from such as seem SUitable to the king "J 
708 Political Treatise
or office in the commonwealth. I say expressly, "being paid by the king from his
own privy purse" so as to exclude the king's bodyguard. For there must be no other
bodyguards but citizens of that same city, taking turns at keeping guard at court
on the king's behalf before his doors.
[35] War is to be made only for the sake of peace, so that with the end of host ilities arms may be laid aside. Therefore when cities have been captured by right of
war and the enemy defeated, the terms of peace must be such as not to entail the
garrisoning of the captured cities. Either the enemy, on accepting the peace treaty,
must be granted the opportunity of redeeming them at a price,23 or else- if by reason of their menacing position this would result in an enduring threat from the
rear-they must be utterly destroyed and their inhabitants resettled elsewhere.24
[ 36] The king should not be allowed to contract a foreign marriage; he should
marry only a kinswoman or a fellow citizen.25 But in the event of marriage to a
citizen there must be this restriction, that her nearest kinsmen be debarred from
holding any state office.
[ 37] The state must be indivisible. Therefore if the king has more than one
child, the eldest should have the right of succession. By no means must it be permitted that the state be divided between them or be handed on undivided to all
or to some of them, and still less is it permissible to give part of the state as a daughter's dowry. For it should in no way be permitted that daughters should inherit the
throne.
[ 38] If the king dies without male issue, the nearest to him by blood must be
regarded as heir to the throne, unless he should have married a foreign woman
whom he refuses to divorce.
[ 39] As for the citizens, it is evident from Section 5 of Chapter 3 that each of
them is bound to obey all the commands or edicts of the king published by the
great council (for this condition see Sections 18 and 19 of this Chapter) even
though he regards them as quite irrational; otherwise he may rightfully be compelled to do so. Such, then, are the foundations on which a monarchy should be
built if it is to be stable, as we shall demonstrate in the next Chapter.
[40] As for religion, no churches whatsoever are to be built at the expense of
the cities, nor should any laws be enacted concerning beliefs unless these are seditious and subversive of the commonwealth's foundations. So those who are
granted permission to practise their religion publicly should build a church, if
they wish, at their own expense. But the king may have a chapel of his own in the
palace to practise the religion to which he adheres.
