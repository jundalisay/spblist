Gravitation is the generative force and radiation is the degenerative force of the universal constant.

These are the opposing powers which, within all mass, seek an equilibrium zone of pressure for the potential of that mass.

Gravitation is the generative force of increasing potential and the regenerative force of decreasing potential.

It is the power within the electric force of action to attract the electric force of action.

It is the contractive power within electricity to divert the universal constant of energy into centripetal vortices of closing spirals of increasing speed, thereby attracting similar states of motion into an accumulation of mass the pressure of which increases toward its center.

It is an expression of the power of electricity to accumulate by induction and, by so doing, to force magnetism to increase its resistance to that accumulation.

It is the inductive force.

It is the desire within the electric force of action to integrate into the appearance of form.

It is the power of electricity to associate by displacement.

Radiation is the power of magnetism to dissociate by replacement.

Radiation is the degenerative force of decreasing potential.

It is the power within the magnetic force of reaction to resist the electric force of action.

It is the separative force which repels, spreads, separates, diffuses and redistributes that which has been assembled by the collective force.

It is the conductive force.

The attraction of gravitation and the repulsion of radiation is nature's simple method of distribution
and redistribution of all masses, so that each mass will find its proper position.
It is not proper to conceive either of these apparently opposite forces as two forces.
The south wind and the north wind are not two winds. They are the same wind blowing in opposite
directions.
It is more correct to say that gravitation and radiation are processes.
The one motive force which directs these processes is equally divided into opposite effects, but these
opposite effects are unequally balanced.
The unequal divisions of the two, opposites totalled together constitute an equilibrium.
The One force never subdivides into any minus expression of force without counterbalancing that
minus with an equal and opposite plus.
Gravitation is a synthetic process of putting things together, and radiation an analytic one of taking
them apart.

The chemist uses these processes in every action and reaction.

Consider for example the reduction of iron oxide at high temperature by passing a jet of hydrogen over it.
What happens? 


The hydrogen falls toward the higher potential of the oxygen of the iron which is sufficiently expanded by the high temperature to absorb the hydrogen, and the hot iron is sufficiently expanded to release the oxygen.

This is an effect of gravitation in respect to the oxygen and the hydrogen. 

They unite, they mutually integrate, and freeze into amorphous crystals of such extended orbits that
they assume the liquid state known as "water."

On the contrary, it is an effect of radiation in respect to the iron and the oxygen.

Both the iron and the oxygen have been brought to such a state of expansion that their ability to hold together is gradually weakened until their pressure preponderance is reversed.

Attraction has changed to repulsion.

The iron expels the oxygen which falls toward the proper pressure zone for so expanded a state of motion.
The oxidation process is an effect of the electric pressure of gravitation.


The reduction process is an effect of the magnetic pressure of radiation.

They exactly balance.

The reduction in valence, pressure, temperature and other dimensions of the iron is balanced by an
exact increase of the dimensions of the hydrogen oxide.
The plus of gravitation in any mass is always balanced by the minus of radiation in some other mass,
in accordance with the pressure laws, "every pressure develops an equal and opposite pressure," and
"the degeneration of any mass is exactly balanced by the regeneration of another mass."
All mass is constantly in motion.
This is a universe of perpetual motion. The universal constant of energy is expressed by mass in
motion.
Every mass is continually changing its dimensions in accordance with its relation to every other
mass.
Change in the position of mass causes change of every dimension of that mass.
"All mass is potential out of place, and all mass constantly seeks the proper pressure zone for its
changing potential."
All mass constantly runs the entire gamut of every dimension of the wave of energy of which it is a
swirling part, until it has run the entire cycle represented by that wave.
No mass can remain fixed in position, not even that which has been apparently arrested in its
motion.
The apple, obeying the laws of gravitation falls to the ground to seek the pressures for its relatively
high potential, where it is apparently arrested in its motion. In reality it never ceases to fall until it has
reached the center of the planet.
It merely changes its dimensions.
The disintegrating apple rises in the air to seek the proper pressures for the relatively low potential
left behind by the electric stream which continued to the gravitative center of the planet.
Like all mass, the apple is simultaneously accumulating and distributing its accumulation of energy.
It is both charging and discharging.
The interruption of the apple's fall to the earth's center and subsequent reversal of the charge within
the mass of the disintegrating apple, does not alter the opposite directions of motion either for the
charge or for the discharge

The accumulated electric potential continues spirally north by way of east in the electric stream to
the planet's center, and the disintegration emanations continue south by way of west, in the magnetic
stream of the earth's ecliptic.
The bound energy being released by the disintegrating apple exchanges its power-time pre-
ponderance for speed-time preponderance.
The balancing opposite of greater power-time is within the planet.
Consider familiar effects of gravitation and apply that observation to others less readily understood.
The apple falls to the ground.
The gas rises into the air.
The planet floats in space.
The apple and the gas are potentials out of place. When released one falls, the other rises. One
gravitates and the other radiates toward the pressure zones of their respective accumulations of
potential, and they pass each other going in opposite directions.
A planet is potential in place for the moment, .................. One column not readable in scan!!!
as the stone heretofore was removed before being dropped into the water.
If suddenly it were released from out beyond Neptune's orbit, what would happen?
Assuming that it held itself together and did not explode in so low a pressure zone, it would fall with
increasing swiftness toward the sun in a line ever slightly curving northeasterly until it reached the
orbit from which it had been removed.
Arriving at the plane of its former orbit, it would sink below it toward the sun with decelerating
speed, then after oscillatingâ€¢ above and below for a time to lose its impetus and to find the inertial
equilibrium position of its potential, it would eventually proceed in approximately the same orbit, as
before. It would have been somewhat damaged by expansion and surface ionization. Its potential would
be slightly lowered as a consequence of its adventure in lower pressure zones, and therefore its orbit
would be slightly farther from the sun than before its removal.
Once more, imagine the giant hand picking up the planet and removing it in the opposite direction,
toward the sun instead of away from it.
If suddenly released within Mercury's orbit, for example, what would happen?
For the purpose of analogy, let us forget the fact that its low density in comparison to that of
Mercury would cause its surface to become white hot and its oceans to disappear in a tenuous vapor. It
would fall away from the sun curving southeasterly towards its orbital plane of pressure at an ever
decreasing speed, exactly as an atom of gas would rise from the earth and fall at an ever decreasing
speed, in an ever curving southeasterly line toward its proper plane of pressure.
The dimensions of this planet would not permit it to remain in Mercury's 'pressure zone, any more
than the density of a wooden ball would allow the ball to remain under water in the pressure suitable to
a stone.
It would approximately find its former orbit, but because of the increased potential absorbed during
its adventure in higher pressure zones, its orbit would be slightly nearer to the sun' than before its
removal.
This universe of motion is one of equilibrium from the beginning of motion to maximum motion,
during which progression stability exchanges its reality for an illusion of stability.
There is a true position for every potential.
