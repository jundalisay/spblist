The elements of matter are but varying aggregations of corpuscular light units gathered together in atomic systems.

Atomic systems differ from solar and stellar systems solely in dimension.

In substance, structure and appearance they are exactly similar.

It has heretofore been stated that all effects of motion are repeative.

Mass is an effect of motion and mass is repeative, with no change whatsoever in its repetition save dimension.

A "bigger" atom such as a solar system is not different from an elemental atom of the same tone in any way but size.

Dimension is purely relative. The law for little mass is the same law as for big mass.

The elements are supposed to be many different substances, each of which is known by a different name.

Each element is supposed to be that one substance and only that.

An atom of mercury or sodium is supposed to be an atom of mercury or sodium which always has been and always will be that and nothing else.

The very foundation stone of modern physics states unequivocally, in its explanation of the principles of energy conservation:

"Not one particle of matter, however small, may be created or destroyed. All the king's horses and all the king's men cannot destroy a pin head."

Matter constantly progresses through the cycle of disappearance and reappearance.

Every Pulsation of thinking Mind brings particles into appearance and relegates others into disappearance.

Matter is evolving and devolving as all other forms of life are evolving and devolving.

A sodium particle is not always a sodium particle. It changes its dimensions in an orderly and periodic manner until it has run the gamut of all the elements of every octave, and returned to its own octave.

A radium particle was once a light unit of hydrogen and will be so again.

More than this, an atom of any element actually contains within itself all of the other elements.

An atom of gold is a gold atom in dimension only. 

It is not even preponderantly of the substance of gold.

It is everything else in the universe.

Everything that is, is of everything else that is. Nothing is of itself alone.

Consider for a moment an atom of manganese or an atom of iron, both of which are very similar in structure.

Instead of thinking of it as an inconceivable little thing, for the purpose of comparison imagine it magnified until it is as big as this solar system

One would not think of this vast solar system as an atom of any one of the elements, for one knows that all of the elements are contained within it.

Yet this solar system is either a manganese or an iron atom.

As nearly as the relator can determine without precise mathematical computation and while awaiting calculation of other dimensions it is one or the other of these elements.

Its plane and extension of ecliptic, its color as a tonal system, its tonal syllable in the octave scale, its endothermic relativity as a charging system, its tonal density, temperature and other dimensions, place it within a practical certainty as one of these two elements.

Later, when calculations have been made in accordance with the relater's formula, the relative age of this system, its exact tonal orbit, its potential position, plane, ecliptic expansion and extension will be exactly known.

This first volume will not, however, be encumbered with mathematics.

The basic principles of motion under which the One living Being functions in His thinking are simple, and simply must they be written down.

The day of the mathematician will come in the adaptation of those principles.

This solar system, being just one huge atom of iron or manganese, let us say, and to our knowledge containing all of the elements of the entire ten octave cycle in their proper proportions, can it not now be clearly seen that the concept of the elements as separate and distinct substances of exact homogeneity throughout their structures, is untenable in this universe of repeativeness in all of its effects of motion?

Cannot it then be seen that it is not the substance itself which determines its effect as an element but merely its position, and its dimensions, in its octave constant? 

Cannot it also be clearly seen that the substance of the element for which it has been named is not
even preponderant in its own element?

This solar system, which is true to plane as iron or manganese, is not preponderantly iron or manganese in its composition. It could not be. It contains vastly larger proportions of many of the other elements and yet some cosmic giant might gather up a handful of such systems as ours, which to him would be a solid, and analyze them in his laboratory as iron or manganese atoms.

Therefore let old concepts of many separate substances be discarded and replaced with the true concept of but the One universal substance of many apparent dimensions, known to man in the language of inner thinking, the language of light.

There is but One cosmic substance. This One substance appears to be divided into many substances,
known as the elements of matter.

The One universal substance first divides itself into the appearance of two opposite states of motion which register as positive and negative elements.

Then two more opposite elements appear.

Then two more opposite elements of increasing potential and harder crystallization appear.

The cosmic pendulum then forms one element which registers itself as neither one opposite nor the other but is equally of each, a bisexual element of maximum opposition in all periodicities of motion.

These seven apparently different substances are but different states of motion of the One substance.

They are the seven tones of an octave, and there are ten octaves of seven tones each.

In the last four octaves are many mid-tones, each one registering its own state of motion.

Man calls those various states of motion of the one substance by many names, and they appear to be many substances.

The apparent difference between the many is due solely to difference of motion and not to substance.

Many states of motion are possible, but there are not two substances in the universe.

All states of motion are measurable and are under the absolute control of Mind. As man is Mind,

Man can, with dawning knowledge of causes, change any one state of motion into any other state of motion, and by so doing transmute any one substance into any other. 

The granite rock may become gold, or radium, at the will of man.
