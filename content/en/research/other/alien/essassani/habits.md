## Addictions and Habits

Addiction is an effect of one's mind trying to fill in a hole in one's life.

Habits are things that you know you are doing. 



## Judgment and Preference

Judgment is invalidating what you do not prefer. 

Whenever you judge anything, you exchange energies with it by focusing your attention on it.
- You then "become" that vibration. 
- You automatically become the very thing you disapprove of.
- You become that which you invalidate.  

Preference, on the other hand, is not judgment.
- Preference is exercising your ability to discern what is really "you", what excites you, and then making choices aligned with the real "you".  
- To prefer one thing does not necessitate invalidating those other things you do not prefer.

So the recommendation is:

**Select what you prefer, WITHOUT judging (invalidating) what you do NOT prefer.**

You become whatever you focus your attention on. To assign any meaning to anything, either a positive or negative meaning, is to invite that into your life. 

Being neutral about something - assigning it no meaning - is the way to not attract that reality into your life.

"That's terrible!" --> You are attracting that reality. 
"That's wonderful!" --> You are attracting that reality. 
"I feel neutral about that." --> You are not attracting that reality.

Cease to invalidate yourself, because you are all you have to work with in your universe. You are the representation, in your own way, of the Infinite. 

If you invalidate that, or any part of that, then you do not allow yourself to function as a whole being capable of using information coming to you from others in a constructive way.   When you invalidate yourself, you are seriously handicapping your only reality-creation-engine.



## Love, Guilt, and Hate

Love is knowing the deservability and worthiness of all.

Guilt is the belief in one's total lack of deservability and the belief in one's worthlessness.

Therefore, Guilt is the opposite of Love.
Hate is not the opposite of Love.

Hate is Love processed through judgment.
Hate is the polarized opposite of Love, but still implies deservability.



### Co-Creating an Experience

Any experience that is shared by two or more people is the result of all the people involved agreeing to co-create that experience.    Even conflict can only occur if both parties agree to be in conflict.   You can only experience that which is resonant with the vibrations you are currently choosing to be.    

If you "believe" you need to be protected, you are attracting into your reality the very thing you "believe" you need to be protected from.    If war is "not of your vibration", there is no way you can experience war.   You can only experience that which you have - on some level - already agreed to experience.
