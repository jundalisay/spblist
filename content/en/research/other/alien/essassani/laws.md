The Essassani gave 5 Laws of Existence:

 <!-- which we put into the Superphysics 5 Layer Model: -->

## 1. You Exist 

You cannot change the fact that you exist. You cannot not exist. 

<!-- (Aethereal Layer) -->

## 2. Everything is Here and Now 
 
<!-- Here and Now relates to Space and Time.  -->


## 3. The One is All and the All is The One 

<!-- (Radiant Layer)
The Sun radiates to all members of its solar system or gravitational theory. The Sun can be thought of as the One, and its solar system is the All.  -->


## 4. What you Put Out is What you Get Back 

<!-- (Convertible Layer)
This mirrors the Hindu concept of Karma. We put it in the Convertible Layer which decides whethere particle interact or not.   -->


## 5. Nothing Changes Except the Four Laws 


<!-- (Material Layer)
Matter is rigid and solid and resistant to change. -->
