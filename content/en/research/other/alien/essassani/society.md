Unity in a society does not come from conformity.
- It can only come from granting equality and validity to the infinite diversity of all the individuals.

The universe is infinitely diverse.  
- Every being has their own way of exploring the idea of infinite creation
- All these ways are equally valid. 

When a society encourages the unique expression of each individual, that is when the society is strongest and most unified.

When you grant equality and validity to everyone, you are granting equality and validity to all aspects of Creation. In return, as a reflection, Creation supports you in everything you do as well.
