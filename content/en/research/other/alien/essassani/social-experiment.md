Dear ____________________________

Despite military, scientific, and political statements to the contrary, we believe that UFOs or UAPs do not represent a threat of any kind to national or global security or humanity at large.

There is overwhelming and well-researched evidence and thousands of eyewitness accounts that these objects have been present throughout Earth’s history without detrimental effect on the day-to-day affairs of humanity.

Without supporting or promoting any related conspiracy theories, we believe that certain organizations are withholding knowledge of this phenomenon out of an irrational fear and for self-serving reasons. 

It’s time for the secrets to end and a program of transparent public education to begin in service to humanity. 

Therefore, we respectfully, but strongly request that you, in your official capacity, immediately and publicly disclose and release, within one year from your receipt of this letter, any and all information in your possession, or that you are aware of being in another person’s possession, regarding UFOs, UAPs, and any and all indications of extraterrestrial life, activities, and technologies, and that you publicly state your support for the complete release of all such information without limitation, editing, redaction, ridicule, or falsification.

Please be aware the members of this social movement intend to vote for and elect only those leaders and representatives who publicly and actively support and promote such disclosure and, with our votes, replace all officials who do not. Thank you.
