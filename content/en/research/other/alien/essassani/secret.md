Many times people fail to manifest the reality that they need. Bashar's advice is as fllows:


**Be passionate about being passionate**

You must exhibit passion to create passion.

Do not revert to negative beliefs when doing their passions.

 <!-- 16:42 -->

This means do not ever give up.

Keep on visualizing and acting out the manifestation even if it isn't there yet. 

Be driven and obsessed with it at every level, until that is the only thought that you have and there is no other choice.  

Do everything that it takes. 

Physically act out the scenario that represents the reality that you want. 

Use all permission slips or tools that you can. 

> Be driven and obsessed with your passions



Do this until this is the only thought that you have in mind to the exclusion of other things.
