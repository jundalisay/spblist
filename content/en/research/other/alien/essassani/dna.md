### Part of Reality Generation 

2 or 3 strands of DNA are for physical reality.


{{< i s="/graphics/bio/dna.jpg" a="DNA" >}}

9 are for higher dimensional planes. These are energy strands that represent the soul blueprint that are then connected to the physical DNA.  

The Anunnaki disconnected humans from the 9 DNA strands. The Anunnaki themselves were not balanced. 

These had switching mechanisms which turned on by themselves. 

The Atlanteans learned to switch these on or off themselves. They tried to mimic the Anunnaki. 

They thought they were copying perfection but ended up copying Anunnaki imperfection.
