## The Uniqueness of Each Incarnation

Each Soul extends portions of itself into time & space as particular incarnations. 
- There are many incarnations at many points in time and space, just as one hand has many fingers. 
- All souls emanating from the same Soul.  

From the point of view of your Soul (outside time & space), all these incarnations (past incarnations, present incarnation, future incarnations) are all simultaneously occurring NOW. 

Each incarnation of your Soul is a unique "version" of you that in all eternity will never occur again. 

This incarnation or version of you will never occur again. So:
- be the most you that you can be! 
- be fully who you are! 

That is the fulfillment of your purpose.



### The Death Transition

When you are dreaming, the dream seems to be "totally REAL!". Yet when you wake up, you realize that it was "only a dream".

Right NOW, you are actually in Spirit. You are not in any physical dimension. You have never left Spirit.
Right NOW, you are in Spirit - dreaming that you are having this physical incarnation.

Right NOW, this dream of having a physical incarnation seems "totally REAL!".

Yet, when you go through the "death" transition, you WAKE UP from this dream, and "remember" that you are actually Spirit.
And you realize, that this entire physcal incarnation experience was "only a dream".


Just because it is "just a dream", does not mean it is not "real".

When your consciousness is focused within any TIME-SPACE-HOLOGRAM, it is "real".

When your consciousness is focused outside of any TIME-SPACE-HOLOGRAM, that then seems to be an "illusion".

"Real" and  "Illusion" are BOTH correct and true! 

It simply depends on your point of view, where your consciousness is focused at any moment.

When you pass through the "death transition" and "wake up" from this dream, you are STILL dreaming. But you are now in a higher-dimensional dream.

Both are equally "real". Both are equally a "dream".

As you ascend into higher and higher dimensions, you repeatedly "wake up" from that dream, into a more awake reality. But that is also a dream, which you will realize when you ascend into an even higher dimension.

- Thoughts are the only reality.
- Dreams are the only reality.
- Consciousness is the only reality.

For example: The chair you are sitting on is not actually "real". But your EXPERIENCE of that chair is "real".


### Personality

A prism splits up unified white light into its component colors. 

Likewise, the personality also functions as a prism, separating the holistic energy of the Soul into the 3 components of:
- beliefs
- emotions
- thought Patterns & actions

```bash
Soul -> prism of Personality -> Beliefs -> Emotions -> Thought Patterns & Actions 
```

. | Beliefs | Emotions | Thought Patterns & Actions
--- | --- | --- | ---  
Definitions | Blueprint | Responses & reactions to something you  already believe to be true | Your thoughts & your physical actions.   What you do
Analogy | Blueprint | The builders | The building materials for building a house
Conclusions from analogy |	Start with clear beliefs for what you clearly prefer | 	Get excited & enthused about what you are creating! Do it with passion! | Select the best materials=  Select the thoughts & actions that are most aligned with your goal. 


External Reality = Holographic Illusion


{{< i s="/graphics/meta/mirror.jpg" a="Mirror" >}}


Our perceived "external reality" is actually an illusion (a holographic illusion) that is reflelcting (like a mirror) back to us our Beliefs, Thoughts, & Feelings.

And, like a mirror, when you change your internal Beliefs, Thoughts, & Feelings, the external reflection changes accordingly.

(A mirror does not have a mind of its own. It can only reflect back whatever is in front of it - whatever are your Beliefs, Thoughts, & Feeling.)

HOW is all this occurring?    It is your Higher Mind that is functioning as a holographic mirror, to create a holographic bubble around you, that is your "perceived external reality".
