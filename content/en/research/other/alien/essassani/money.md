## Seven Neutral Needs

### Immediate-Term Needs

These are needs that will kill you shortly if you don't have them

1. Air

2. Water

3. Sleep (Regenerate, Re-energize)

This includes dreaming which reconnects you to Spirit. Without sleep, humans last only 11 days.

4. Food

There are exceptions, such as some breatharians who can survive without food. You will die in 2-3 weeks without food. 


### Non-Immediate-Term Needs

These are needs that will kill you if you don't have them for months or years.

5. Shelter and Good Environment 

This does not need to be a house. It has to be beneficial. You have to be able to thrive in this environment. Examples are a tropical island. 


6. Connections

You need to have a relationship with someone or something. This something can be animals, plant, a rock, etc. There should be connection with it.  

The Essassani no longer need to eat or sleep because they are always connected to everything. You connect with whatever helps you who you really are. 


7. Creative Expression 

This is an expression of your unique purpose or identity. This is where acting on your passions come in.  This expresses your energy. 



## Five Forms of Abundance

Abundance is the ability to do what you need to do, when you need to do it. 
- Money is only one of many valid tools to achieve this abundance. 
  - It is not always the most direct tool to use for doing what you need to do when you need to do it.

Abundance comes in 5 forms:

1. Money: This is the most common form now
2. Barter: This was common in the past
3. Gifts: Do not reject gifts
4. Synchronicity
5. Inspiration




### You are created with everything you need

An example is a caveman who created art with just a burnt stick

Nature knew that your skin was the only thing needed. Your real skill is being you. Then mutate it and transform it by using your imagination and inspirtaion. 



Q. I don't have anything. I don't have any skills. 

A. You should believe that you have everything. You don't need to be taught anything. 




### Marrying the Coin or Money

Marry the coin and integrate it into your heart so that each beat expresses "abundance", "abundance", "abundance".



Q. The Bible says that the love of money is the root of all evil. 

A. Do not let your worth be determined by money. Instead, let money be determined by your worth. [This means that you can have money if you believe that you are worth a lot]


Q. Should you donate to get abundance?

A. It is necessary to help others. Donation is one form, but it is not the only thing. It is completely up to you.



Q. Should I share money or donate money, or should I keep it for myself?

A. Some might be donating from a feeling of lack. The sharing or donation must not create an awkward imbalance. You should have the absolute conviction that your sharing will be replaced. 

Ideally, your resources would increase that you would have to think about whether to donate or not.
