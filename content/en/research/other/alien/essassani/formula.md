### 1. Act on Your Highest Passion

A lot of people mistakenly think that the highest passion is the largest and most difficult life goal, such as something really grand. 

Bashar clarifies that it can be very simple. Such as being aware of your breathing, enjoying the sight of your surroundings, etc. 

The important thing is that you prefer it the most and the best of all the things that you can think of or feel for at that moment.

After you finish it, then move on to the next one, so that your whole life becomes a life of highest passions.   

<!-- The Aethereal Layer is the highest layer in Existence.  -->


### 2. Take the Action As Long As You Can, As Far As You Can Until You Can Take it No Further

Many people just want, but never do. And so their reality never matches what they want. 

So it's important to act on your highest passions instead of just thinking or talking about it. 


<!-- Spatial Layer
All Actions happen within spacetime. So taking the action as far and as long as you can maxes out the Spatial Layer. -->


### 3. Absolutely Have No Expectations

This is the most common point of failure caused by the negative ego imposing its limited expectations onto the higher mind. 

<!-- Radiant Layer
The sun shines on everything equally and always gives energy for free, without expecting compensation. Hav -->


### 4. Stay positive no matter what

This keeps the vibration up especially since mentality creates reality and you attract what you are the vibration of. 


<!-- Convertible Layer
Change always happens in the universe. It is important to stay positive whenever those changes happen.  -->


### 5. Let go of Negative Beliefs and Definitions


This still is in line with keeping your vibration up and removing blockages to the manifestation of what the higher mind wants for you. 

<!-- Material Layer
The Material layer is the crudest of the 5 Layers and is Negative just as the Aether is Positive.

Letting go of Negative Beliefs hits at the Material Layer directly.  -->


## Triple A Formula 

The Triple 'A' Formula is based on the Triple 'A' Automative Association which you call when your car is in trouble.

These are steps that you can take when you are in trouble:


### 1. Acknowledge What You Have

Don't think about what you don't have. Thinking about the negative puts you in the negative state. 


### 2. Appreciate What You Have Fully
 
This will put you in a state of positive appreciation. 


### 3. Allow What Will Happen Next

Be open to what the universe will give.
