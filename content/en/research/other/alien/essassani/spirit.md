When the spirit agrees to have a physical experience, it follows these steps:

1. Create a blueprint in the template level reality

These will have scenerios and themes to be experienced.

This will lead to an automatic function to focus on those experiences. 
- This function is part of the consensus level agreement of the physical reality game


### The Higher Mind 

This includes the creation of the higher mind since the higher mind is lower than the soul. It acts as the liaison between the lower mind and the soul. This is similar to the man on the boat who helps the diver while he is diving. 


2. The spirit passes through that template

It bonds with the physical body and, through that focus, the reality becomes crystallized.

An analogy is deep sea diving. The template-level is like preparing to dive by getting and wearing the snorkel and equipment.

The ego is the mask and glasses which help you focus and see through the deep ocean. Without it, the experience would be terrible.

3. The spirit becomes an emobryo

The embryo develops the pineal gland on or after the 49th day.

This gives it the capacity to lock in to template ideas. 


4. After 3-7 years, the spirit-body link is strengthened 

After this period, the solid vibrational link is strengthened between the spirit and body. 

Before 3 years, the child might want to leave and die instead of strengthening that link. 


5. The Personality Construct Develops

The body develops the personality through the neural connections, cellular development, etc, construct to realize the template.

The child absorbs all the telepathic inputs from the parents and society which makes its way into its matrix personality. 


6. More Disconnection from the spirit realm

The more we grow and develop physically, the more we forget about our spirit form and even the higher mind.  

We need the guidance and communication of the higher mind to guide us while we get deeper into physical reality. 

The ego structure's job is to focus you in physical reality. 

Because of the forgetfullness of spirit, the ego assumes the burden of achieving that completeness and what was laid out in the template level. 

The template are made up of beliefs which is assigned to the ego to experience and act out. 

This is why all beliefs are self-reinforcing because the ego is programmed to amplify those beliefs. 

Because of forgetfulness, the ego makes its own beliefs from the things that it picks up in physical reality.
