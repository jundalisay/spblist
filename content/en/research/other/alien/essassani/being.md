## The Movie Analogy


{{< l a="Bashar" >}}
In a movie screen, the light on the screen creates an illusion of a character acting in a movie. 

So the arrangement and patterns of the light energy creates am ego-character in physical reality. 

This ego-character  allows your own consciousness to experience it as if it were autonomous so that it can reflect back to you.

{{< r a="Woman" >}}
Why did it give me suffering? I feel angry that I gave myself bad experiences. 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Bashar" >}}
You are angry at yourself because you did not take yourself out of the position of suffering, for not choosing something else. 

You should go into the belief that makes you choose what you chose. 

Your higher mind knew you had to experience certain themes. But it never imposed that you should experience them in a negative way.

### Bigger Eyes Mean More access to Higher Mind

The eyes are the window to another dimension. 

Some ETs have bigger eyes because they have more access to the higher mind.  

You can know another person by starting into his/her eyes. 




<!-- conscio pattern can be dealt with as if it were autonomous for the purpose of reflectivity.   -->
