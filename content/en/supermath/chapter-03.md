Instances are the perceptions of unique identity. 

The 4 Operations are:

1. Addition of Instances

2. Reduction of Instances 

This is called subtraction in arithmetic

3. Expansion of Instances

This is called multiplication

4. Contraction of Instances

This is called division


{{< q a="Descartes" c="Geometry" >}}
All Arithmetic is composed of only four or five operations:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Extraction of roots

The last can be considered as a type of Division.
