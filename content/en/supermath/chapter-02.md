A number is an instance of an identity. 

"Instance" is Latin *instantia*, meaning presence. This is consistent with our perception-based Superphysics. 

We can say that:
- 1 tomato is one instance of a tomato-identity. 
- 3 tomatoes are 3 instances of the tomato. 

Sometimes, numbers are used by themselves without any physical object. 

For example `1 + 1 = 2` uses pure instances. It adds 1 instance to another instance to come up with 2 instances. 

The mind assigs a new identity or name to this "2-instance instance" as the number 2. 

There are an infinite number of instances, and so the mind would have to assign new identities to each instance, which is then has to remember.

Since the mind's memory capacity is infinite, it groups the identities into repeatable patterns using the same base identities. 

Humans have settled for base-10 as its grouping. For example, instead of writing arbitrary symbols up to infinity such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 𝄞, 𝄢, 𝄬, 𝄮, 𝅘𝅥, 


simply repeats the names of the identities. 


### The Base

Vortex numbers are base-5 instances that can make geometry easier and less irrational.
