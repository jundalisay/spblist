Material Superphysics explained the 3 actions of the aether that is the effect of the 3 Influences.

1. Flow (association, expansion)
2. Attraction / Repulsion
3. Memory or storage

We call these the operations of the mind.


{{< q a="Hume" c="Enquiry, Section 1" >}}
It is remarkable concerning the operations of the mind, that, though most intimately present to us, yet, whenever they become the object of reflexion, they seem obscure. It becomes, therefore, no inconsiderable part of science barely:
- to know the different operations of the mind
- to separate them from each other
- to class them under their proper heads
- to correct all that seeming disorder, in which they lie involved, when made the object of reflexion and enquiry. 
{{< /q >}}


The flow includes logic or how the mind naturally jumps from one idea to another, even without thinking.
- Thinking makes the jumping more forceful, which is really just adding to the flow

Quantification or digitization or digitalization is an effect of the repulsion to the continuous analog flow. 

Mathematics is a flow of quantification to make sense of the analog flow. 


## The Operations of Mathematics: Instances 

Quantification creates instances that are notated as numbers. 

This arises from counting discrete identities as instances. 

This makes each instance or number a unique identity itself, each with its own quality that is revealed when they are processed with other identities.
