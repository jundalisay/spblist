Darwin is actually evil too. 

A Westerner who looks at wild animals will see competition and struggle for existence.

An Asian will see symbiosis and harmony. 

Darwin saw phenomena from Nature and imposed Western mentality on it to create a policy of competition to the death, racism, and survival of the fittest.

This was then used by Hitler as the Iron Law of Nature to kill inferior races.
