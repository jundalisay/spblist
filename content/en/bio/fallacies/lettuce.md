I was presenting our 'Maximized' farming system to a few people and was immediately triggered when one of them mentioned "lettuce".

Ever since the pandemic, people have pushed lettuce-growing over other more nutritious veggies like beans and carrots.

They seem totally unaware that lettuce has pathetic nutritional value.

I discovered the uselessness of lettuce when I turned vegetarian in 2004, and realized why vegetarians eat tofu (soybeans) instead.

Lettuce was popular in the 80s when salads became a fad as a part of weight loss diets. But it was thankfully made obsolete by the Keto diet which properly emphasized dark greens such as broccoli and spinach.

The national green leafy vegetable is mustasa as proven by the song Bahay Kubo. Beans make up 5 of the 18 vegetables of that song, and litsugas is nowhere. 

I have asked growers, farmers, and seed companies why they even do lettuce in lowlands. 

They reply that it's popular. 

The interest in lettuce seems to have begun during the pandemic when people were locked down and started experimenting with vegetable gardens. 

This made them turn to hydroponics which is inside the house. 

This then made them turn to lettuce which is the standard hydroponics crop because hydroponics is all water and lettuce is just water. 

I even call it junk food because the water and energy that it uses is a waste since you can just drink water and get fiber from less energy-intensive crops.
