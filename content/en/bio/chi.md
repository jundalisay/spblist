There are 2 Forces in Existence: 

1. Positive (Yang or Shiva)
2. Negative (Yin or Shakti). 

These always go against each other to create alternating waves. 

When waves hit each other they create nodes, as vortices. 

In the physical domain, these vortices leads subatomic particles in Quantum Mechanics, leading to wave-particle duality.

In the metaphysical domain, these lead to chakras.

Therefore, a chakra is a vortex made from the merging of pulsative waves of a certain wavelength or frequency. This merging can be thought of as collisions forming a vortex.

Frequency is the repetition of a wave per unit of spacetime. 

So a higher frequency cuts up metaphysical spacetime into smaller slices. Its reality is more refined, high definitionm, clearer, and more vibrant just as 4k Ultra High Definition is more refined that Full HD. Each change in scene is crisp and clear. 

A lower frequency has bigger chunks of spacetime, like a low resolution VGA screen. Each change in scene is choppy, blurry, and not smooth.

The chi in a person is the waves that go through the person to make him alive. 

A non-living thing such as a rock has no chi waves, just material waves such as electromagnetism and heat. 

A piece of iron can receive heat and magnetic waves, make it flow through it, then transfer it to other rocks. But if the other rock is not ferromagnetic, then the iron can only transfer heat, but not magnetism. 

In Cartesian Physics, the waves of the other rock has a different frequency because its internals are configured differently e.g its particles are oriented differently and are not aligned and have no straight channels.  

Likewise, a person can let chi flow through his body and emit or transfer it to other people. But if the chakras of other people are configured or oriented very differently, then the chi does not transfer.

This is similar to a VGA screen only able to accept VGA signals to procude low resolution, and 4k UHD screen being able to accept 4k UHD signals, or how a 3G phone can only accept 3G signals but not 5G.

Chakras can be reoriented through constant imposition, just as some metals can be made magnetic by the constant imposition by strong magnetic waves which forcibly realigns their channels. 

Similarly, low frequency chakras can be upgraded to become more intelligent and sense more of the universe through education and training. The longer the training, and the younger the training starts, the better.

The educational system already does this from pre-school to university in order to upgrade crude humans into intelligent humans capable of modern thinking. 

Likewise, the Taoist, Yogic systems educate and train humans to upgrade their chakras to detect more of the invisible aspects of Nature, as subtle feeling.
