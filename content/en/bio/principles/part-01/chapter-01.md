## The Two Domains and Paths of Life

Superphysics allows 2 Domains in Reality: Physical and Metaphysical

This is applied in Bio Superphysics which divides the path of life into two: The Physical and the Metaphysical Tracks.
- The Physical Track is for the Physical Body. This runs through the 5 Layers.
- The Metaphysical Track is for the Metaphysical or mental Body. This runs through the 5 Strata.
  - This can only be detected by minds and not by instruments

Physical Layers | Examples 
--- | ---
Aether | Mind
Spatial | Spacetime
Radiant | Light
Convertible | Neutrons 
Material | Protons

Metaphysical Strata | Examples 
--- | ---
Aether | Identity, Self or Ego, Mind
Spatial | Chi, Chakras
Radiant | Elementals
Convertible | Feelings
Material | Thoughts 

{{< img src="/graphics/bio/tracks.jpg" alt="Elemental Tracks" cap="The Circle of Life begins with the Idea of the Supreme. It then gets crudified as matter through physical energy. Physical life begins when organic matter meets with living energy or prana in a biologically-sustainable environment (composed of the 5 Layers). Elemental life takes a shortcut and is created where light or the aether meets living energy. Our system interprets organic matter as physically-crudified elementals. These are ready to express life upon encounter with living energy">}}

The Physical Track is made up of physical life that we all know of. This is divided into kingdoms and species such as those of bacteria, plants, animals, and humans.  

The Metaphysical Track is made up of a range of metaphysical life-forms that we commonly call as spirits, deities, or elementals. Like physical life, this has many divisions which we organize according to the 5 Strata. 

We only discuss the Elementals that have **physical effects** and not for any impractical speculation. We then use these effects to solve problems in the Physical Domain. 


## What are Elementals and what are they used for?

[Paracelsus](/research/paracelsus/nymphys/tractatus-1) calls Elementals as spirit-beings that have human-like properties. 

{{< img src="/photos/medieval/angkor.jpg" alt="Angkor statue" cap="Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism have A LOT of Elementals" >}}

We think that such properties arise from them having chakras, similar to how humans and animals have chakras. These are vortices that channel the ideas of the Supreme onto either physical or metaphysical reality. 

**We define Elementals as metaphysical beings that can cross over to physical reality as to produce physical effects**. 

This makes them different from pure metaphysical beings that cannot create such effects, usually because they are so subtle and so far away from physicality. Such entities, we call as spirits. 

<!-- An example of a common spirit is the Holy Spirit in Christianity which serve merely to inspire and  -->

Elementals are useful in gauging the health of Nature. The destruction of natural environments cause the Positive Elementals to die out, allowing the negative ones to flourish. 

It is these Negative Elementals that implant evil desires and ideas into physical life, in humans, animals, etc. This then manifests as the degeneration of society through wars, crime, immorality, etc. 

Therefore, the knowlege of Elementals is essential in creating a better world both ecologically and morally.  

The science of Elementals falls under Bio Superphysics which focuses on life as an active expression of the ideas of the Supreme. This means we have to reclassify life as:
- physical  
- metaphysical 


Generally, their study will add diversity to human life just as:
- the study of art leads to artists and galleries
- the study of sports leads to athletes and spectator sports
- the study of cooking leads to chefs and restaurants
- the study of religion leads to priests and monks in churches and temples 

All of these contribute to human and economic activity. In fact, the practice of using elementals was prevalent enough during the Roman times that their lawmakers had to set laws against what were regarded as supernatural acts. 





## Ways to Detect the 5 Elementals


There are various ways to detect Elementals just as you can detect animals through their sound, smell, sight, or touch.

The most effective way that we know is through a developed ajna chakra which acts as a window or third eye to the Elemental universe. 

This is explained in the biology of Rene Descartes, wherein humans detect:
- physical stimuli through the nerves in the sense organs and
- metaphysical stimuli through "animal spirits" in the heart. 

From the heart, [the animal spirits go to the pineal gland](/research/descartes/man/section-30) in the brain which is the basis of the ajna chakra in Hinduism.  

{{< img src="/photos/psych/meditate.jpg" alt="Meditation" cap="Humans can 'see' the Elemental Universe through their ajna chakra. It can be 'felt' through the heart chakra and others">}}


Our preferred technique is to meditate with your back touching against a large tree. This creates a physical contact connection with your spine and the tree which then has connections to the Earth and the Elemental Universe. 

An important part is to hold the proper mudra to let the aethereal energy circulate through your body. For this we have tried 2 mudras:
- pranayama open handed (in the photo above)
- right hand over left hand* (not interlocking) with thumb touching and hands on the navel area  

{{< f f="*Left over right hand emits energy" >}}


Another way, though far less effective or sustainable, is through the use of psychedelics. These alter the brain in order to allow the perception of the other layers of reality. However, this also might cause physical damage, aside from building dependence, and so it is not recommended. 





<!-- Elementals in Hindiusm are called Yakshis and Yakshas who guards treasures, equivalent to Gnomes. -->

<!-- Their king is Kuber,who got patronage from Shiva and has son Nalkuber who is married to Heavenly Damsel,or fairylike woman Rambha.  -->

<!-- We have Heavenly Damsels or Apsaras who are equivalent to fairies such as Rambha, Urvashi, Menaka,Tillotama etc. They mostly entertain Michael or Indra, the lord of heaven. The elves we call as Kinnaris and Kinnars,they are synonymous to Jinns and has the potential to make illusions. They are like little girls mostly. There are mantras to invoke them. -->


<!-- In India, especially rural India, you will still see people making offerings (mostly food) to certain spirits every day, while warding off unwanted demons using protective charms such as temple bells and charms.


Many people in India have told me stories of meeting such spirits face to face, often having taken on a human-like appearance, and displaying magical powers. Their shapes are often shifting and inconstant, illusory in nature. Often they are identified by their unusual eyes. 

Devas are felt to guide the processes of nature, such as the growth of plants, and to reside within the very light of sun, moon, and stars, and within the elements of earth, water, fire, air, and ether. Indian farmers especially propitiate them as they have since the Vedas were revealed. The reverential worship of nymphs continues in India today as fervently as ever it did in Pagan Greece. Certain trees are especially sacred to particular spirits. -->
