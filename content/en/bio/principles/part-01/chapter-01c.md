## Find your own superstition

The most advaned minds would not need superstition at all. Ths is because their mind can bend reality by themselves and do not need any tools. For example, you might need a hammer to drive nail thorugh wood. But a superhuman with skin of iron would not need any hammer and can just use his hand to drive the nail through. 


The mind sacrifices its natural aetehreal properties tp adpp[tartificial electromagnetic ones that makes it sequential and speed withint that lgoic. Instead of jumpting from question toanswer, logic step by step from information to answer.  ]
