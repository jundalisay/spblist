Cartesian Relationality is also seen in the bonds in disaccharides where the Convertible layer, as water, break down sugars. 


Carbohydrates are the fuel of nature, technically called saccharides. They are made up of 3 elements:

1. Hydrogen (1)
2. Carbon (6)
3. Oxygen (8)

Carbs come in different classifications:

1. Monosaccharides - This is the smallest unit of carb
2. Disccharides - These are made up of 2 monosaccharides
3. Polysaccharides - 


### What are Disaccharides?

There are 3 kinds of disaccharides

1. Maltose = glucose + glucose 

2. Sucrose = fructose + glucose

3. Lactose = glucose + galactose 

This is broken down by lactase enzyme
