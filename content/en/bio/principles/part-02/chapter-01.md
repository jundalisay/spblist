### Carbon-Oxygen

Our Pentagonic Versions of Matter puts carbon as "6" at the top of the first 5 chemical elements and the second ring in the "aether arm".

{{< i s="/graphics/bio/carbon.jpg" a="Carbon" c="Carbon is at the top of the first 5 elements" >}}

It is allied to oxygen "8" in the radiant or fire arm. This gives carbon energy upon oxygenation. 

Since the aether is the most positive of the 5 layers and since carbon is the first aether-ish element after Hydrogen, this gives it the best existential position to receive vital energy as a type of ositive Force.


### Silicon-Sulfur

Another known base of life is silicon which is tied to sulfur for its energy source to enable vital expression (the expresion of the Positive Force in Negative Matter). 

Our Pentagonic Versions show that silicon is in the convertible or water arm and is tied to sulfur which is in the aether arm. 


From here, we can say that carbon-based life is more sentient when idle just as silicon-based life is more sentient when active. 

The Mendeleev Periodic Table of Elements does not expose that connection. This is why our Pentagon is better and more useful. 



### Carbohydrates: Hydrogen-Carbon-Oxygen

Monosaccharides

Disaccharides 

Polysaccharides 

Hydrolyss is opposite of Condensation.
