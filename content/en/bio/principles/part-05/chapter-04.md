### From Food into Lymph

Our body gets both the building blocks and energy from the food that we eat. 

The first step is for food to inside our stomach and intestines where it mixes with digetinve fluids and are absorbed by the intestines to become rasa.

This goes into the liver and kidneys to be purified into blood.

The blood becomes flesh, fat, bone, bone marrow, and ultimately into lymph.

The lymph becomes the seminal fluid for the creation of new life.

<!-- 1. Acidic (Shukra in Sankrit)

This includes all the spirits that are released through insensible transpiration, as well as the subtle humors from which pimples and similar things that are said to arise from yellow bile are formed. 

The acidic particles serve as vehicles for other substances.

2. Bitter (Rasa in Bio Superphysics)

These are responsible for the felting and almost all the intestinal processes. 

3. Sweet (Flesh in Bio Superphysics)

The sweet particles compose the flesh. -->

<!-- 4. Salty (Blood in Bio Superphysics)

The salty particles are also mixed with the acidic. These puncture the pores, opening them up.

5. Fatty (Fat)

The fatty particles are accurately mixed with the watery particles -->

<!-- 6. Watery (Bone in Bio Superphysics) 

The watery particles, being cold and slow, compose the phlegmatic humor.

7. Pungent (Bone marrow in Bio Superphysics)

These are compact and dense, compose the melancholic humor and the serous particles, which are permeated by the acidic particles, change into acids. 



In Treatise on Man, Descartes introduced the concept of animal spirits which is known as chi in China and vayu in India. 

Instead of "life force" or "vital energy", it would be better to call them as "life-waves" in order to match quantum field theory which believes that particles are excitations in an all-pervading field.

Instead of fields, we use the aether substance, which has liquid dynamics.

Instead of excitations, we use vortices, called chakras, which are formed from the intersection of so many waves.

We combine the principles of Descartes, Chinese medicine and Hinduism to explain life. 

It begins when the Supreme Entity has an idea for an organism. 

This creates a metaphysical soul-idea made up of a chain of excitations or vortices in the aether as the 7 chakras (for humans), representing the 5 Elements.

This then transfers to a physical fetus.

These life-waves are the cause of nerve impulses, ideas, and memory.

And so the creation of nerves in the fetus is a sign that it has gotten a soul.  

An organism needs more life-energy in order to grow in size (occupy more space) and to live longer (occupy more time).

A complex organism needs more life-waves for better expression of its soul-idea. 

It gets life-energy from food, which is matter with life-energy. 

It gets life-waves from its own chakras which interface the all-pervading aether just as electrons interface with virtual photons to create magnetism. 

These life-waves go to the brain where they branch out through the nerves, and to the blood where they spread to the body. 

The heart is the powerplant for the life-waves. The brain is the command center. 

The brain has the pineal gland which has the blueprint of the soul-idea. The life-waves get the data from it to code into each DNA as it goes around the body.

Any bodily damage or diesease goes against this blueprint. And so the life-waves instruct the cells to correct such anomalies, leading to the healing process.


 and are a more sophisticated kind of prana or aethereal living energy. 

The creation of these spirits begin with digestion when food supplies this initial prana to the heart and lungs. In a fetus, this energy is from the mother's blood. 

The lungs then give more physical energy as oxygen, while the heart gives the aethereal energy from the chakras, as vayus or chi.



In the Asian sciences, the vayu is a version of prana just as electrocity
