### From Food into Lymph

Our body gets both the building blocks and energy from the food that we eat. 

The first step is for food to inside our stomach and intestines where it mixes with digetinve fluids and are absorbed by the intestines to become rasa.

This goes into the liver and kidneys to be purified into blood.

The blood becomes flesh, fat, bone, bone marrow, and ultimately into lymph.

The lymph becomes the seminal fluid for the creation of new life.

<!-- 1. Acidic (Shukra in Sankrit)

This includes all the spirits that are released through insensible transpiration, as well as the subtle humors from which pimples and similar things that are said to arise from yellow bile are formed. 

The acidic particles serve as vehicles for other substances.

2. Bitter (Rasa in Bio Superphysics)

These are responsible for the felting and almost all the intestinal processes. 

3. Sweet (Flesh in Bio Superphysics)

The sweet particles compose the flesh. -->

<!-- 4. Salty (Blood in Bio Superphysics)

The salty particles are also mixed with the acidic. These puncture the pores, opening them up.

5. Fatty (Fat)

The fatty particles are accurately mixed with the watery particles -->

<!-- 6. Watery (Bone in Bio Superphysics) 

The watery particles, being cold and slow, compose the phlegmatic humor.

7. Pungent (Bone marrow in Bio Superphysics)

These are compact and dense, compose the melancholic humor and the serous particles, which are permeated by the acidic particles, change into acids. -->
