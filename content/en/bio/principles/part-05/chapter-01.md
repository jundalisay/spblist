There are 5 Strata in the Metaphysical Domain | These Manifest as the 7 Chakras in the human body


<!-- 7 aether 3 unconscious (union)
6 aether 2 subconscious (intuition)
5 aether 1 conscious (intellect)
4 spacetime - universal
3 radiant - heat for digestion
2 convertible - sex
1 material - identity or ego

 -->


In Material Superphysics, galaxies take the form of spatial vortices in the aetherspace for the purpose of deploying aethereal ideas onto the physical domain. 

This system is replicated in the metaphysical domain in living organisms through their mental (metaphysical) body. These spatial vortices are called **chakras**. 

Like galaxies, these are flat discs that rotate in a counterclockwise manner. 

Recall that galactic vortices have 2 main components:

1. **Invisible spacetime particles**

These create cohesion (dark matter) within the galaxy, and gravity within its stars and planets

2. **Stellar vortices (stars)**

These are part of the Radiant Layer (electromagnetism) relays the galaxy's characteristics to the rest of the universe. (i.e. if there were no stars then the galaxy would have less impact on the universe)

Similarly, chakras have 2 main components:

1. **Chi or animal spirits**

These facilitate cohesion between that chakra and the physical body.

2. **Nerve impulses (electromagnetic)** 

These relay the chakra's characteristics onto the physical world through the body's physical actions.


## The 7 Chakras from the 5 Strata

<!-- When viewed from the perspective of the individual soul, this manifests as the 7 chakras -->

{{< q a="Socrates" >}}
From these ends extends the spindle of Necessity [anthakarana], on which all the revolutions turn.
- The shaft and hook of this spindle are made of steel.
- The whorl [chakra] is made partly of steel and also partly of other materials.
  - It has one large hollow whorl which is scooped out.
  - Into this is fitted another smaller one, and another, and another, and four others, making eight in all, like vessels which fit into one another.

The whorls show their edges on the upper side. On their lower side, all together form one continuous whorl. This is pierced by the spindle, which is driven home through the centre of the eighth.

There are 7 main charkas, 3 of which are in the aethereal strata. The plentiful number of aetheral chakras versus the non-aethereal ones are the effect of human advancement over other species on Earth. 


Chakra | Strata | Palmistry Mounts | Color or Wavelength
--- | --- | --- | ---
Crown | Aethereal | Luna | Violet
Third Eye | Aethereal | Saturn | Indigo
Throat | Aethereal | Mercury | Blue
Heart | Spatial |  Apollo | Green 
Navel | Radiant | Jupiter | Yellow
Sex | Convertible | Venus | Orange
Root | Material | Mars | Red


These chakras then are the foundation of both:
- the inward senses
- the external feelings or passions

{{< q a="Descartes" c="Passions of the Soul, Article 2" >}}
A passion in the soul is commonly an action in the body.

### The Inward Senses

Traditionally, these refer to the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin. However, based on the vortices and elements paradigm, we refer to the 5 senses as those that are related to the 5 chakras.  

<!-- Layer | Sense Organ |
--- | --- | ---
Aethereal | Ear | Hear
Spacetime |  Heart | Immaterial Feelings, Sense of balance and direction
Radiant | Eye | Sight
Convertible | Smell, Tongue | Smell, Taste 
Matter | Touch | Material Feelings  -->


Chakra | Sense
--- | ---
1st Chakra | Pain
2nd Chakra | Taste, Smell
3rd Chakra | Sight (explains diabetec retinopathy)
4th Chakra | Touch, Balance, Temperature, Proprioception
5th Chakra | Hearing



### The 6th and 7th Senses

The 6th sense therefore are the perceptions related to the 6th (ajna) chakra. 

There are other senses that are not unlocked by default. These need effort to develop and master. As these have been rarely documented, we can base them on our 7 Chakra model.

Chakra | Sense
--- | ---
6th Chakra | Siddhis: Clairvoyance, Levitation, Detection of Elementals, Chi, etc.  
7th Chakra | Multiverse, Brahma (Mukti)
8th Chakra (Theoretical) | (Moksha)



<!-- Layer | Sense Organ | Sense
--- | --- | ---
Aether | Ears | Hearing 
Spatial | Ears | Sense of Balance
Radiant | Eyes, Heart | Sight, Temperature
Convertible | Tongue, Nose | Taste, Smell 
Material | Skin, Heart | Tactility  -->
