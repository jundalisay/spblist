The main point of fasting is to reduce the fluids going upwards to the brain. The difference between 2 days of a moon phase is very small as to be insignificant. For example, high tide is at 1.3m both in Jan 25 and 26.

So it does not matter whether Purnima is at 24 (Dada J's calendar), 25 (US time), or 26 (Maharlika time).

A more important factor is the availablility of water, fruits, and toilet to break the fast. Improper breaking will reduce the impact of fasting regardless of day and is even harmful.

So there are differences depending on time, place, person. But we give choice and ultimately leave it to the person instead of forcing a choice.
