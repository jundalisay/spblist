Our **Anunnaki Hypothesis** states that humans were created by the Anunnaki in order to help them [mine gold](/research/ancient/sumerian/enki/part-04/).

The Anunnaki are an alien species from Cygnus constellation. Their planet was heating up and like ours and so they needed atomized gold in their stratosphere to keep it cool. 


{{< q a="Enki" c="Enki and Ninhursaja, Part 3" >}}
Let the magilum boats of Meluḫa transport gold and silver and bring them to Nibru for Enlil, king of all the lands.

This explains:
- why humans are the only intelligent species on Earth
- why all human civilizations have gold ornamentation

Note that this excludes uncivilized humans such as savages. This has been explained as the early variations done by the Anunnaki.

This creation was done through genetic engineering by mixing parts of the Anunnaki DNA with the Homo Erectus species that was already present on Earth. 


### The Four Races

After some trial and error with the first batches, [the Anunnaki](https://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/edition2/etcslbycat.php) finally made the [four proper races](/research/ancient/mayan/popol/part-3/chapter-02/) 


{{< q a="Popol Vu, Part 3, Chapter 2" >}}
These are the names of the first men created:
1. Balam-Quitzé
2. Balam-Acab
3. Mahucutah
4. Iqui-Balam

They only were made and formed. They had no mother and no father. They were not born of woman, nor were they begotten by the Creator nor by the Maker, nor by the Forefathers. Only by a miracle, by means of incantation were they created and made by Tepeu and Gucumatz.. They were endowed with intelligence. They saw and instantly they could see far, they succeeded in seeing, they succeeded in knowing all that there is in the world.

<!-- The problem was that  -->

### The Deluge

The most advanced humans were the Atlanteans who were split between good and bad. 

Enlil, an Anunnaki leader, wanted to destroy the humans and so the Anunnaki used the weapons of Tiamat to draw in the bigger version of comet Encke which currently creates the Taurid meteor showers.

According to the Essassani, this meteor shower hit the earth twice a year for 20 years. 

The Atlanteans were mentioned as the Atra-Hasis in The Epic of Gilgamesh.


We can look at the postive aspects of humans as a genetic engineering product. For example, instead of focusing on the human lust for gold and material objects, we can focus on the ability of humans to follow instructions and work for the benefit of others.
