The materialist Physics of Newton and Democritus believes that gravity comes from matter.

On the contrary, Material Superphysics, which is based on the Physics of Descartes and Plato, believes that all forces come from outside of bodies or matter. This is the non-materialist paradigm. 

Space is filled with qosts that become mosts whenever matter occupies a space and displaces the qosts. 
- These mosts constantly stream out of that matter in straight lines, creating a gravitational territory which Physics calls a gravitational field. 

An analogy is a ball that displaces the sand, with the most sand being at its surface.

The bigger and denser the matter, the more space particles are displaced, the larger and stronger the field.


When 2 fields meet, they create a channel that lets the displaced space particles stream easier. This creates a low space-pressure area between the bodies, and a high pressure one behind them. 

The high pressure behind the bodies pushes them together and is the cause of the gravity.

Newton thought that the low pressure was a pulling force. Einstein thought it was space warping. 

In fluid mechanics, this is known as the Bernoulli principle, from Daniel and Johann Bernoulli who were devoted Cartesians and anti-Newtonians.

This high-low pressure mechanism is the same for magnetism wherein magnets have channels that reduce the pressure for virtual photons, creating a high pressure magnetic field outside.

We convert Newton's Universal Law into Cartesian by renaming `G` as the volume of space particles displaced per unit of matter. 

```
F = G (m1 m2)/r^2
```

We keep `m` as the amount of matter, as the Material Layer.

This means that `F` is the volume of displaced space particles, as the low pressure that causes the high pressure.

Newton's Universal law thus translates to: "The force of gravity between the 2 soms are based on the most volume that go between them."

Variable | Newtonian | Superphysics
--- | --- | --- 
F | Force of Gravity | Force of mosts
G | Gravitational Constant | most volume from matter
g | Earth gravity | mosts from the Earth's surface  
m | mass | som volume

The `g` of earth is different from the `g` of Jupiter because their som and qosts are different.

From this we can see how material gravity is from space wanting to reduce the displacements and keep everything neat and flat.

<!-- Cartesian Spacetime Mechanics: Material Gravity

Space is filled with invisible space particles that are displaced whenever a material body occupies space. 

This causes those particles to go out in a straight line up to a certain distance. 

This creates a gravitational field. 

When 2 gravitational fields meet, the particles go beside each other forming parallel lines.

These lines act as a channel that lets both fields go through each other more easily. 

This creates a low pressure between them and a high pressure behind them. 

This high pressure pushes them together until the channel is removed.

This is the same mechanism for magnetism and the strong force. 

Magnetism is stronger because the channels have lesser pressure.   

The strong force in the center of a proton is the strongest because there is near zero pressure between the quarks
