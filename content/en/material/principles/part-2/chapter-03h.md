The previous section explained that material gravity comes from the high pressure that arises from low pressure.

We are pushed down to earth because the Earth displaces space particles. 

Most of these are just above its surface, diminishing the farther you go up and away from the surface. As a result, gravity is weaker as you go up

So below you is low pressure space. This creates a high pressure space above you that then pushes you down. 

We can call this as the material gravity of the Earth or a downward gravity. 


### Microgravity

This mechanism can also be used in reverse by making an object stick upwards or sideways and defy downward gravity, as reverse gravity. 

This is done by reducing the pressure between 2 surfaces by eliminating or reducing the flow of the space particles between them. 

There are 2 easy examples of this:


1. Gauge Blocks

Gauge Blocks are rectangular blocks that are perfectly smooth. Two blocks together thus can have no space between them. 

This creates a zero pressure between them and a high pressure outside, which then pushes them together. 

Rather than call this as a vacuum force, it would be better to call it a pushing force, just to be consistent and simple.

The center area formed by the 2 blocks must be either straight or wider at the center. In this way, this external space-pressure can converge on the center of gravity.

2. Gecko Feet: Van Der Waals force

According to Physics, geckos stay on the ceiling because of a "Van Der Waals force", an intermolecular binding force, that binds their feet to the ceiling and counteracts gravity

This Van Der Waals force uses charge-based binding between molecules and are therefore electromagnetic. 

However, this same force does not seem apply to gauge blocks that stick to each other without electromagnetism.

So we refute the fundamental mechanism of the Van Der Waals force. We instead apply the same mechanism for gauge blocks. 

<!--  Instead, the mechanism is said to be intermolecular binding, without any explanation

Cartesian Physics explains that the mechanism for both are exactly the same -- the presence or absense of spacetime particles flowing between 2 surfaces

This is the same mechanism for gravity

This is because in Cartesian Physics, gravity is the pushing force of high pressure space particles onto low pressure -->


A gecko's feet has tiny flexible hairs called spatulae. These can conform to the roughness of the surface by filling in all the empty space. 
- This is similar to fine-grained sand being able to fill a bottle and eliminate all space


The "Hamaker constant" A used in Van Der Waals force is therefore the same as Newton's G, mentioned in the previous section. 

The difference is that:
- Newton's G is the volume of space particles displaced by a body. This has a macro perspective.
- The Hamaker constant is the volume of space particles flowing between surfaces. This has a quantum perspective.


Since G is a constant, then there is a limited weight that reverse gravity can keep up.

This also means that the Van Der Waals force is part of the matter-space family of forces like gravity, friction, and surface tension

This is opposed to the electromagnetic-space family like electricity, magnetism, and microlensing

Microlensing wrongly uses G and so it fails when there is no mass, leading to the false idea of dark matter
