How do spatial vortices form?

{{< youtube cQtvHmgQtng >}}


Spacetime vortices form when the aether agitates spacetime particles in the Spatial layer.

This changes the passsive qosts into active mosts which then collide.

The collisions come from mosts that come from all angles. Eventually, the strongest stream, which represents the shape or the configuration of the aether, dominates the other streams. 

This forms a flat plane that rotates due to the opposition of the weaker partcles, similar to the Coriolis force. 

The strongest plane dominates the other planes and dictates the orientation and size of the vortex.

The center of the vortex gets more spacetime particles. 
- This leads to congestion and slower speed. 
- The outer part has less congestion, leading to faster speed. 

In a stellar vortex, as a planet or star, electromagnetic particles (mor) go with the rotating vortex. 
- This pushes the spacetime particles, increasing their speed.
- They become slower the farther they are from the center as the inverse square law.

IN a galaxy or star, this creates a boundary on the edge of the territory of the vortex. This edge creates the red shift and halos.
