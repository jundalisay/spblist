We define:
- "timespan" as the gap between specific perceived identities, as experiences, events, or incidents
- "time" as the gap within perceptions in general


A perception is new or different from a pervious perception if it has something different in it. So we can say that time is an effect of change.


### 3 Kinds of Time

A universe that has zero changes does not have time. Changes in the universe happen in the 3 Layers:

1. Aethereal
2. Radiant
3. Material


The changes are facilitated by 2 Layers next to them:

1. Spatial

This results in the general concept of time 

2. Convertible

This results in particle decay times. 


These lead to 3 kinds of times:

1. Aethereal

This is mental time. This is the time that "flies fast when you're having fun".

2. Radiant

This is relativistic time facilitated by invariance and constant speed of light.

3. Material

This is absolute time in classical mechanics.

By pegging time to c, Einstein blocked out aethereal time and therefore the aethereal and spatial layers. 

This is why we downgrade his simultaneity of time from a principle into a convention in order to restore Nature and allow mental or subjective time. This means that:
- the metric tensor varies and is not even a tensor because this changes his 4d continuum into 2d slices that can be arranged arbitrarily instead of sequentially.
  - This arbitrariness allows teleportation where matter can be in one place now and a totally different place in another.

People would use the simultaneity of time when they need precise timing values, such as those for GPS.

### The Unity of Space and Time

Unlike the other layers, the spatial layer is about the gap between:

- the perceiver, as the subject
- the perceptions, as the object 


In the Physical Domain, space is dominant because objects are dominant. For example, an object, as a static perception, exists in:
- 3 dimensions of space as length, width, height
- 1 dimension of time


{{< img src="/graphics/physics/slices.jpg" alt="The Direction of Perception" cap="Time always moves forward" >}}

Notice how the "Riemann" object on the left makes obvious the space it occupies, as its length, width, and height. **But it does not make the time aspect obvious.**

> A physical object makes the space aspect obvious, but not the time aspect


Our sliced object on the right, on the contrary, exposes **both the space and the time used by perception** to have knowledge of the same object.  

This is because we look at the object one part at a time. This is in turn because the mind can only have 1 object inside it at a time.

{{< q a="Sarkar" c="Idea and Ideology" >}}
Unless the mindstuff takes the form of incoming the quantum-perceptions, no perception is possible. This is because the ego can work only when the mindstuff adopts a form.
{{< /q >}}


Usually, we look at it from top to bottom. We do not see the object in totality immediately as to know all its visual properties.

Therefore, our spacetime model makes the unity of space and time easier to understand. 
- This unity is really the unity of subject and object, or of perceiver and perception.


## Time Always Moves Forward

Both space and time are products of perception which always moved outward or forward from the **self** as the lower mind. This is why time always moves forward whether externally or internally.

This is because main purpose of the aethereal layer is to facilitate perception. 

A consciousness that moves backwards will be deleting its own mind its its own ideas and feelings.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/soul.jpg" alt="The Direction of Perception" cap="Time always moves forward from the perspective of the lower mind." >}}


The different properties of time aries from the different densities of the perceivers:

Perceiver | Quality of Time
--- | ---
Lower Mind | Time Moves Forward Linearly
Higher Mind | Time Moves Forward Linearly Faster or Slower 
Soul and Oversoul | Everything is Simultaneous (Aether dominates, Spacetime is negligible)

- In Sanskrit, this oversoul is the Brahman
- In Parmenides by Plato, this oversoul is the One

{{< q a="Parmenides" c="Chapter 7" >}}
Does the One as a Whole experience time?  Does it become older and younger than Itself and Others?
- To exist is to be in the present time
- To have been is to be at a past time
- To be about to be is to be at a future time
Then the One, since it has being also has time. Time is always moving forward. 
{{< /q >}}


Planck time is the smallest unit of time between spacetimes. This is represented by quantum of timespace or qots.  


### Static Space Versus Dynamic Time

The Physical Domain has less change and dynamism compared to the Metaphysical. 

For example, when we look outside our window, we see trees, buildings, and objects. These do not change the space that they occupy so readily. 

But when we have metaphysical dreams, the same trees, buildings, and objects might totally change from one scene to another very rapidly. 

This is because the Metaphysical Domain is closer to the Aethereal layer which is purely kinetic and dynamic.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/spacetimeratio.png" alt="Spacetime ratio" cap="In the lower layers, space is dominant. In the higher layers, time is dominant." >}}


This is why we say time gets more malleable and simultaneous the higher the layer, while space becomes less important. 

This leads to our concept of timespace. 



## Physical Time Versus Metaphysical Time

We classify the material and radiant times are physical time, and the aethereal or mental time as metaphysical. 
- Physical Time occupies the lower layers of timespace
- Metaphysical Time occupies the upper layers. 

<!-- Here we likewise create the concept of Physical Time and Metaphysical Time.  -->

In Physics, this is roughly similar to the concept of Proper and Coordinate Time from Einstein's Relativity.

- Physical Time is objective.
- Metaphysical Time is subjective.

<!-- Physical Time in Superphysics also includes Newtonian Time and the Radioactive Decay-time of certain elements. -->

<!-- These 'times' follow the hierarchy of the 5 Layers. This means that:
- Metaphysical time is superior and the most important of all the times as it dictates our common actions
- Radiant (Electromagnetic) time and Radioactive Time are important for precision measurements. 
- Material time is the most common time, as the one seen in clocks.

<!--Relativity says that Proper Time passes faster on a mountain than at sea level because  -->

<!--
The water spins because the energy is transferred to it by the bucket. There is a dip in the center because that is the center of gravity of the bucket, which serves as the anchor for the gravitational band between the water and the bucket and the Earth. 

In outer space, the bucket will be a torus and the water will form a donut shape since there is no band with the Earth.  -->

 <!-- because it covers more space for the same amount of Coordinate time, so Proper time adjusts accordingly. -->


<!-- Let's say 2 mountain-level proper-milliseconds pass for every 1 sea-level proper-millisecond. 

This is to compensate for the 1 coordinate millisecond taken by the perspective of man at sea-level who really bases both measurements from the center of the Earth. Proof is that the Hafele–Keating experiment showed difference between East and West travel.

If Proper Time were measured based on the Sun, then their Proper time would be the same: 12 noon sharp.

<!-- ## Replacing Einstein's "Time"

Einstein defined time as the time that it takes for light to travel between two events in spacetime. But this is circular reasoning since the speed of light also has a time component. Moreover, we defined spacetime as the effect of the qosts creating distance between each other, even before light existed. How can something non-existent define something that already exists?  


{{< q a="Einstein-sophist" c="Relativity Simplified, Section 8" >}}
We test simultaneity by putting an observer in the middle M between A and B. He as two mirrors inclined at 90° to let him see both A and B at the same time. If he sees the two flashes of lightning at the same time, then they are simultaneous.

You object by saying that they would only be true, that time would be simultaneity, if all light travels at a constant speed. <i><b>But the speed of light would itself be measured by time, so this is reasoning in a circle -- simultaneity has absolutely nothing to do with light.</b></i>

I answer that this simultaneity of time is only used for us to make empirical decisions.

<!-- Spacetime exists before, and independent of, light and electromagnetism. So how can something like light -- something that is unnecessary to spacetime -- be required to define spacetime? -->

<!-- Einstein's definition turns the effect as the cause which leads to make-your-own-spacetime such as De Sitter, Taub-Nut, and Godel, etc. If we exist in one universe, how can it have different spacetimes?

![E=mc2](/images/visible.jpg)

{{< cap >}}
E=mc^2 is true only if applied to visible objects. But no one seemed to notice it because everyone is likewise taking the perspective of the visible universe. The sophistry (half-truth, half-fallacy) of this equation is exposed by the fact that Einstein's field equations can't be solved and that wormholes have never been found.

<!-- > *The theoretical and arbitrary spacetimes are a consequence of General Relativity which uses light as a measure of everything. The problem with this is that light is an electromagnetic wave which manifests in a field, of which the nature is arbitrary just as each wavelength has its own properties. This leads to arbitrarily-invented spacetimes like De Sitter, Taub-Nut, Godel, etc. This is the same mechanism that causes human minds to create arbitrarily-invented concepts like God, Allah, Yahweh, Amaterasu, etc.

## Let's Get Moving!

These two make objects appear to move, depending on the rules of their layer and their relation to each other and to the observer. We can call this illusory movement in physical reality as 'relational physical movement' which we simplify as 'bands' and can be grouped into the five layers: -->

<!-- Name | Physics Name | Manifestation | Practical Goal
--- | --- | --- | ---
[Aethereal Bands](/material/principles/part-2/chapter-03) | Pseudo-science | Movement and transformation for qoas (ideas) between probabilities or multiverses inside minds | Bio Superphysics: know whether a person is moving towards disease so his course can be changed<br>Supersociology: know where the feeling of society is heading, so it doesn't go into anarchy<br>Economics: know whether the economy is moving towards poverty and inequality
[Spatial Bands](/material/principles/part-2/chapter-04b) | General Relativity | Movement of supermassive blackholes (qosts) as the expansion of the universe and galaxy rotation | [Allow fusion](/material/solutions/fusion) by levitating plasma, and allow teleportation to other galaxies
Radiant Bands | Special Relativity | Movement and transformation for photons (quanta of light or qol) and electrons (quanta of electromagnetism or qoe) | Make [light-based computing](/material/solutions/light-based-computing) more practical
Convertible Bands | Feynman Diagrams | Movement and transformation for neutrons | Allow alchemy 
[Material Bands](/material/principles/part-5/chapter-03) | Newton's Laws | Movement and transformation sourced externally | Enable teleportation and levitation technologies

From here, we can unify the ideas of the great physicists:

Physicist | Mistake | Cause of Mistake | Correction | Superphysics Score
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Kepler | The universe is confined to a fixed firmament | Limited observations | The universe is infinite (arbitrary) | 8/10
Descartes | Gravity is caused by the aether which creates spinning vortices | Imposing the aethereal layer directly onto the physical layer | The aether is in a separate layer that affects the physical layer indirectly. This leads to the spinning of galaxies and orbital movements | 7/10
Newton | Gravity comes from mass | No observations of galactic movements | Mass comes from gravity, gravity comes from the aether | 5/10
Einstein | Gravity comes from mass through the distortions of the spacetime fabric or field | Using light as the measuring rod | Use sound as the measuring rod, in line with Kepler and Pythagoras | 3/10
