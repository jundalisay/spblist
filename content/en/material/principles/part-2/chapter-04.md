Chapter 3 explained the 3 media of the Spatial layer:

Media | Description 
--- | ---
Timespace | Quasi-aethereal 
Aetherspace | Connector to the aether via timespace and other spacetimes
Spacetime | Slices of reality


These media are matched by substances:

Media | Substance
--- | ---
Timespace | Time
Aetherspace | Vortices, Holes, or Tunnels
Spacetime | Space


<!-- Its substance or representative perception is a black hole which we name depending on its layer.

Layer | Substance Name | Physics Name
--- | --- | ---
Spatial | Galactic Qost | Supermassive Black Hole
Radiant | Stellar Qost |  Black Hole
Convertible | Planetary Qost | Planetary Core
Material | Material Qost | Electron Cloud 
 -->


Physics calls these vortices in the spatial layer of the physical domain as **black holes**.

- In the Newtonian paradigm, these have a material center as a singularity. This is because Newton believed that gravity comes from matter.
- In the Einstein paradigm, these are based on energy, forming wormholes. This is because Einstein believed that gravity is from the warping of spacetime.  
- In the spatial stratum of the metaphysical domain, these vortices manifest as chakras.

<!-- The main difference is that their main property is mass, which in Newton's time was defined as the amount of matter in a body. This changed when Einstein came along who equated mass (and electromagnetic mass) with energy. This is why the main property of a black hole in Phsyics is **energy**.  -->


However, in Superphysics, a black hole is a spacetime vortex called sos that leads to a tunnel to the aetherspace. Its main properties are:

2. Vortex rotation direction
1. Vortex energy quantity
3. Vortex energy quality


The concept of rotation direction is missing in Modern Physics whether from Newton or Einstein. 

<!--  was only struck by the size of the planets such as Jupiter relative to the Earth. This extends to Einstein's Relativity which does not have the concept of spin inherent in its theories.

Descartes, on the other hand, was sensible enough to think of the relative rotation of different objects such as light, moons, and planets.    -->




## Vortex Energy Quality

There are 3 qualities of of sos':

SOS | Examples 
--- | ---
Stellar (sos3) | Stars, Pulsars, Neutron Stars
Galactic (sos2) | Galaxies, Quasars, Nebulae
Universal (sos1) | Universes


A stellar sos commonly manifests as stars and planets. This is because planets are sos that failed to become stars.

A galactic sos commonly manifests as galaxies and quasars. These are larger than stellar. 

A universal sos is a universe. Our sos is evidenced by the cosmic microwave background radiation. 


### The Difference Between Stellar and Galactic Vortices

In the 1630's, Descartes described black holes as spinning spacetime vortices which prevented light from going into their center. These were opposed to stars which allowed light to go into the center.

The main reason for the difference is the sheer size of a galaxy's center compared to that of a star.

- A stellar vortex is small.
  - This allows the surrounding spacetime particles to easily compress and pressure the center. 
  - This pressure leads to a star.
- A galaxy's vortex is so huge.
  - Its circumference resembles a straight line. 
  - Since particles must travel straight, they go around the circumference instead of going towards the center like straight radii.
  - This makes the light stay outside of the vortex, different from a star where the light stays in the center. 

This outside light predicted by Descartes is now seen as the bright accretion disk of a supermassive black hole.



## Vortex Energy Quantity

A sos can have have a lot of energy of low energy. A high energy vortex can manifest as a large spiral galaxy or a spinning pulsar.

## Vortex Rotation Direction

Finally, a vortex can rotate clockwise or anti clockwise. 

Clockwise | Anti clockwise
--- | ---
Star | Pulsar
Galaxy | Quasar

## Vortices as Tunnels

Spacetime slices are separated by the aetherspace. 
Some areas of spacetime have high concentrations of the aether that allow aetherspace to exist as holes or vortices that can allow matter to tunnel through. 

These are natural portals that, when accesssed by timespace, can allow matter to jump between spacetimes. 

These can be recreated artificially by electro-aetherically enlarging the aetherspace that is already in matter. 

When enlarged as to wrap around matter, it creates a vortex that can let the matter tunnel through to another spacetime.  This is how UFOs travel vast distances, as explained by Bob Lazar and the Essassani.
