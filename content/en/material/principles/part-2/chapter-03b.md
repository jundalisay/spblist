Timespace is the sublayer where time predominates and space is minimal. 

This is visualized by our aethereal Cartesian Plane which is made up of polar coordinates.

Timespace is closer to the Aethereal Layer because:
- it has more time than space
- it has more access to discrete perceptions since time is the gap between perceptions in general (as opposed to space which is confined to a single perception)


While spacetime looks outward from the expanse of a single perception, timespace looks inward from the variety of perceptions. 

This is why timespace is necessary to reveal and analyze the gravitational signature of an identity, which is totally inward or inherent.


## The Glue for Spacetime

In Cartesian Physics, time is made up of independent moments or timespans. It follows that space is also independent as well. This leads to our concept of spacetime slices.

{{< q a="Descartes" >}}
**A life-span can be divided into countless parts, each completely independent of the others.**  My existence at one time does not follow that I exist at later times, unless some cause keeps me in existence. **That cause creates me afresh at each moment.**

The nature of time is different in:
- the time for bringing something into existence, and
- the time needed to keep a thing existing.
{{< /q >}}

These independent slices:
- exist inside the probabilistic aetherspace and
- are glued together by timespace 

The qualities of timespace are derived directly from the aethereal layer above it. This means that it is affected by, or is the result of, monads.

This is why the timespace particles are the holder for the aethereal gravitational signature in the spatial layer. 


## How it Works

Every material thing, such as a box, has the 5 Layers: 

Layer | Description 
--- | ---
Aether | Identity of the box
Spatial | The space occupied by the box. This includes location
Radiant | The energy of the box
Convertible | The reactivity of the box to other matter
Material | The mass of the box

Its location in space and time is determined by its timespace, as the main particle of the Spatial Layer. 


<!-- The affinity between the gravitational signatures between identities leads to the attractive force between them. 

The contrariness between them leads to the repulsive force. 

This means that attraction, repulsion, and movement depends on the qualities of gravitational signatures which we house in the quantum of timespace (qots).  -->


<!-- The differences between them lead to the repulsive force which artificially leads to levitation, and naturally is called the expansion of spacetime by Physics. This is based on the Law of Conservation of Idea. -->


<!-- Superhysics arrives at the qost of an object by flipping the Schwarzschild Radius to make the mass dependent on a [gravitational variable G](/material/fallacies/general-relativity) (not a constant) and by using a limiting tensor <code>s</code> instead of a constant speed of light <code>c</code>`. 

Energetic qost that serves as the center of a planet, star, or galaxy rotates as a vortex. This rotation snags other lesser qosts and makes them go or away from that center. While going towards that center, it pushes matter with it. The more matter, the more the pushing force, as weight. This is what Newton saw and why he said gravity comes from matter (as mass). 

Each matter-particle already has radiance and spacetime inside it. This is why massive objects create a larger vortex than a less massive one. This is what Einstein saw and why he said that gravity comes from the warping of spacetime.

A mass with an active vortex, such as a planet with a liquid core, has more gravity than a mass that has an idle vortex, such as an asteroid or a moon. A star has a much more active vortex than any planet and so its gravity is naturally so much more. 

In this system, the precession of Mercury has nothing to do with the speed of light that Einstein assumed. Instead, it has all to do with the idle core of Mercury compared to the active core of the Sun.  -->


<!-- #### 1. The mass and size* of a qost is dependent on its gravitational signature

Since a qost represents a complex idea, then a small Schwarzschild Radius represents a small idea while large one represents a large one. 

> *As a 1-dimensional thing, a qost really does not have a size. It would be better to refer to it as an area of strongest influence. 



#### 2. The universe did not start from a material singularity -->

<!-- Rather, it began as an infinite number of discrete ideas streaming through onto physical reality via qosts. This is similar to your TV screen having no single starting point. -->

<!-- In this analogy, the LED bulb would represent a star or galaxy qost that emits its idea or feeling as the physical color and material from the star or galaxy. -->


<!-- #### 3. The expansion of spacetime really represents the development of those original potential ideas into actual ones

The universe can expand infinitely just as ideas can be developed, and mixed and matched into other ideas infinitely. The physical expansion does not mean that the universe started from a singularity or will collapse back into one. That kind of thinking arises from materialist thinking, by thinking that the material universe came from a material cause.
