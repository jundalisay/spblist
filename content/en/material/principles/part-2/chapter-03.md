The Spatial Layer is made up of 3 media based on the 3 Influences Model:

Sublayer | Media | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Upper | Timespace | Time is dominant
Middle | Aetherspace | Alternates between time and space (i.e. probabilistic)
Lower | Spacetime | Space is dominant

- Timespace is the sublayer where time predominates and space is minimal. 
- Spacetime is the sublayer where space predominates and time is minimal. 
- Aetherspace is the layer that combines both timespace and spacetime in order to have an arena for both physical and metaphysical perceptions. 


### The Various Forces from the Spatial Media

The media of the spatial layer create the various forces:

Layer | Media | Manifesting Force
--- | --- | ---
Spatial | most + qost | Dark Energy
Spatial | most + qost2 |  Dark Matter
Radiant | most + mor | Lensing
Radiant | most + mor2 | Magnetism 
Material | most + mom | Gravity
Material | mos + som | Gluon or Strong Force



Forces that work in the Spatial and Athereal layers are not detectable by instruments. That is why physicists are unable to find dark matter, dark energy, and gravity.

Spacetime or Empty Space | {{< i s="/graphics/physics/general.jpg" a="Spacetime" >}} | Empty space is made up of invisible spacetime particles, as most3s, that fill up the universe. These no independent rotation and is why they have seemingly no effect on anything. Rather, they go with the powerful qosts that propel them
Aetherspace | | This the space inside an atom and other places that are too small for qosts -->




### The Spatial Layer has Different Dynamics in Other Universes


In our galaxy, mosts are arranged with particles facing outwards. This causes material spheres.

However, in other galaxies they might be facing inwards. This would create a reverse gravity wherein creatures would walk on the sky of planets.

<!-- decided that most3 act like fluids by being less rigid, allowing them to convert from most3 to qosts. 

In other universes within the multiverse however, the aether might decide for for most3 or gravitation to be more rigid. 

Instead of pulling objects down to a planet's core, it might push those objects farther. 

The diversity of the universes therefore are due to the difference in the qualities or properties of the media and quanta of each layer.  -->

Three-dimensional solid geometry should have naturally followed two-dimensional geometry. But three-dimensional solid geometry is in such a ludicrous state. It made me pass over it, and go on to astronomy as the motion of solids.

This distinction between 2-D and 3-D geometry was the focus of Johannes Kepler and Kepler's laws which is the basis of our theory of gravitation which is opposite that of Newton and Einstein.  -->
