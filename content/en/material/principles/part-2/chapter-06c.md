Rule 3 of Descartes' Rules of Motion says that every moving body moves..

3.1. ..in a **straight line** when alone

3.2. ..in a **curve or a circle** when moving with others

3.3. ..**away from the center** when in a circle

This is because each body displaces space particles around it as its gravitational or aethereal field. This field then makes that body go around or curve around it. 

### Centrifugal Force on a Non-Round Body

A car that moves around a corner will experience a centrifugal force as Rule 2 of state continuity (inertia in Newtonian Physics). 

This is mirrored by Rule 3.3. 
- The inner part will experience the centrifugal force (Rule 2)
- The outer part will experience the centripetal force (Rule 3)

> Centripetal and Centrifugal Force are important because they form the basis for vortex mechanics

We can say that:
- the centrifugal force is the original force of the body wanting to go to the original direction 
- the centripetal force is force that caused the change in course in the first place 

### Centrifugal Force on a Round Body

A liquid body becomes round because of the pressure from external space particles. In some cases, the body rotates and forms a vortex. 

For example in a planet: 
- The inner part experiences the centrifugal force as bulging along the equator (Rule 2)
- The outer part experiences the centripetal force as gravity  (Rule 3)


## Centripetal Needs Centrifugal

These forces are real because they can be felt. They are important because they form the basis for vortex mechanics which is what Cartesian Physics and Relationality is based on.

This is applicable in other sciences such as Sociology. 

For example:
- a couple might want to divorce as a sign of their centrifugal force
- but this is countered by their children as the centripetal force that keeps them together

Or in organizations:
- the employees might want more freedom as centrifugal force to do their work in their own way
- a boss might exert a lot of centripetal force to make his employees follow his plans
 
In both cases, the Kepler Harmonic Ratios, as the effects of Cartesian Relationality should be applied to find the optimal balance of forces.

You could deny these force-names and instead call:
- the centrifugal as an inertial force (Newton's 1st Law)
- the centripetal as an action-reaction force (Newton's 3rd Law)

But this does not take into account Relationality (Relativity in Modern Physics which needs fast speeds).

Implementing Centrifugal and Centripetal terminology is essential in finding the relational balances as an effect of angular momentum. 


### Why Newton Had No Angular Momentum and Why Einstein Discards Centrifugal 

Newton should have established angular momentum as a 4th Law. But this would have supported Descartes' vortex theory and so he did not decree it.

Instead, he simply combined Inertia and Newtonian Relativity on the center of a body.  

Einstein discards centrifugal because he discarded gravity as a force by transferring the mechanism into spacetime. 

And so:
- the centripetal force becomes the warping of spacetime
- the centrifugal force becomes inertia 

So by focusing too much on mathematics, they made the effect as the cause. 

Newton and Einstein thus took Physics further away from the true mechanisms which would have allowed:
- levitation which is used by levitating Buddhist monks and
- teleportation which is used by UFOs.   

These set back technology and the solutions to chronic problems affecting humanity.
