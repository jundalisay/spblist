<!-- ### The Changing of Spacetime Slices Leads to Time Dilation and Length Contraction -->

The mechanism for Radiant-Radiant relationality is the timespace which is in the moving body, with reference to the speed of light. 

The constant speed of light is based on the emission source. After it is emitted, it stays constant until it hits something that can slow it down. 

The big complication in Physics is that **the emission sources also move**. This leads to 2 movements:

1. Movement by light from the Emission source

This happens in the radiant layer.

2. Movement by the Emission Source

This happens in the material layer. These 2 movements create a ratio between each other. 
- This ratio is the `âˆš(1-0.5c)2/c2` that adjusts the apparent length of the moving source. 

This phenomena is called **invariance** by Modern Physics.
- This invariance is the foundation of our timespace particle which is determined by the emitter or observer.  

This can be visualized by 2 flashlights, both 1 meter, emitting light in empty space.
- Flashlight 1 is stationary
- Flashlight 2 is moving at half the speed of light
  - This makes it seem that it is trying to catch up with the light that it emitted

This gives an apparent length of 0.866 meters to flashlight 2

<!-- A key component of Einstein's Relativity is time dilation and length contraction.

We define:
- space as the gap within perception 
- distance as the gap between 2 identities 
- timespan as the gap between 2 perceptions
- time as the gap between perceptions in general 
- time dilation as the increase of timespan within time 
- length contraction as the decrease of distance within space


We take the variables L, v, and c. 

`L-UFO` is the length or space occupied by a very fast moving body per unit of time. 

`L-you` is its occupied space from your non-moving perspective.

`v` is its velocity.

`c` is the maximum speed within physical spacetime.

The square root of this ratio is then applied to the occupied space that you see.

The faster it is, the less its occupied space because the more it assumes the nature of the upper elements as light, spacetime, or the aether.

This means that there are many things moving faster than light that are not material nor electromagnetic. 

We put these into our relation.

We put the length from its material perspective. Then add its velocity ratio squared. 

Then impose that spacetime onto the object to get the contracted length. -->


### Special Relativity as the Changing of Spacetime Slices Listed in Francis Bacon Tables

Physics judges things based on their speed and movement. However, Superhysics judges speed and movement based on their layer.

In the future, anti-gravity technology will be available and a ship will find itself moving through space with various objects moving at different speeds.

This is similar to video games. However, a video game crash is not fatal, but a real crash is. So the physics that enables anti-gravity via spatial relationality should also reduce the chances of fatal crashes. 

For this, we suggest a machine learning system that plots the relationalities in real-time, as Francis Bacon Tables.


<!-- The sequential speed of light is the maximum speed achievable by the Radiant Layer. 

The maximum speed of the Convertible Layer is a bit slower and that of the Material Layer is the slowest.  

For example, the max speed of light is 300,000,000 m/s. But the max speed of a proton in an actual collider is only 31,400,000 m/s.

So length contraction and time dilation are not effects of speed, but of the Element of the identity.  -->
