The polarities in the Spatial Layer are:

Vortex | Positive | Negative
--- | --- | ---
Vortex | Anticlockwise Rotation | Clockwise Rotation
Vortexless | High Pressure | Low Pressure


The chapter on sosts and qosts already explained the concept of clockwise and anticlockwise vortices. 

Here we explain high and low pressure that causes spatial phenomena such as surface tension and gravity.  



## Coriolis Force



## Bernoulli effect
