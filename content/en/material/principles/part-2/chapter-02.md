The Spatial Layer is divided into upper, middle, and lower sublayers according to the 3 Influences Model.  

The upper sublayer is quasi-physical, while the lower is physical.

Sublayer | Physicality | Medium | Substance | Quantum 
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Upper | Quasi-physical | Timespace | Time | Galactic Black Holes / Chakras (Dark Matter and Dark Energy)
Mid | Physical | Aetherspace Multiverses | Black Holes |  Stellar and Planetary Black Holes (Orbital Gravity and Surface Tension)
Lower | Physical | Spacetime | Space | Material Things (Atomic Gravity)


The Upper Spatial is not purely physical as it is the realm of:
- mental space and time
- the multiverse
  - This allows acces to different universes, each one with different Physics.

The Middle Spatial is within the Upper Spatial. 
- This is mostly physical where information is deployed onto the current universe.
- This sets the speed of light of the current universe. 

The Lower Spatial is the realm that we can see.
- This leads to matter having length, width, and height that does not change so easily.
- It is also the one that "glues" subatomic particles of the Material Layer together. 

The aethereal layer also has perceptions but are no longer bound by space and time. 

We will first discuss the properties of space and time from the Lower Spatial sublayer, as this is nearest to human perceptions.
