The spatial layer is below the aethereal, as the 'container' of reality.

### Definition and Properties of The Spatial Layer

The Spatial Layer is where perceptions, such as physical reality, take place. 

Unlike the aethereal layer which is only quasi-physical, spacetime is both quasi-physical (via timespace) and physical (via spacetime). 

Each particle in the Spatial Layer is made up of 4 aether particles. 
- Force and matter particles are interchangeable

It is purely kinetic energy and has no static forms*. Rather, the relatively static forms of spacetime manifest as the lower layers.
- Parts that have low kinetic energy manifest as empty space or a vacuum. 

{{< f f="*The static forms in the nucleon of an atom are made up of the Material Layer and not of Spacetime." >}}



The spatial layer leads to spacetime and sets the speed of light, since it is superior to the 3 lower Layers of:
- Electromagnetism
- Weak Force
- Strong Force

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/layers.png" alt="The 5 Layers" cap="The spatial layer holds the Physical Universe which is made up of Electromagnetism, Weak Force, and Strong Force" >}}


This layer gives the properties of size, space, timespan, and age of the universe and everything in it. 


## How It Works

The spacetime layer is the gateway that allows the ideas from the aethereal layer a chance to cross over onto physical reality via **spacetime vortices**, called black holes by Modern Physics, through galaxies and stars.

In Bio Superphysics, the Spatial Layer becomes the **Spatial Stratum** and the spacetime vortices manifest as **chakras** which allow organic ideas to cross over as organic phenomena.  

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/multiverse.png" alt="Multiverse with Universes" cap="Pre-existing aethereal ideas flow down into physical reality in a probabilistic way. A single idea, when deployed, therefore has many versions in other universes of varying densities" >}}

Within one universe, the creation of these vortices leads to the mutual repulsion between them, leading to the perception of space and time.


## Space and Time as Spacetime

The current concept of spacetime in Physics came from Einstein who believed that it is a fabric that warps wherever there is gravity, with:

- 3 dimensions as spatial length, width, height
- 1 dimension of time


<!-- Superphysics Spacetime is different in the sense that we define it as the thing that splits perceptions into 2 components:

1. Space

This is the particle part or crudified part or physical part of the perception.  

2. Time

This is the wave part or subtle part or metaphysical part of the perception. -->


This arises from a matter-first perspective. This is because a material thing, like a rock, has length, width, height. Its rolling movement from location `A` to location `B` then takes time depending its speed and mass.

In contrast, our spacetime is seen from the aether-first perspective, as a result of perception or observation:

<!-- ### The Cartesian Alternative

To free Physics from the trap, we use the definitions derived from Rene Descartes.  -->

- space is the gap within perception
- distance is the gap between perceived identities
- timespan is the gap between perceptions
- time is the gap between perceptions in general 

<!-- All movement happens within a distance and all observations of such movement happens within timespan. Thus, all formulations of the rules on movement must take into account *distance* and *timespan*, which humans carelessly bunch up as "space" and "time".  -->

{{< youtube Va3VvSrR8YA >}}

Unlike speed and mass, this system uses **perception** and **identities within that perception**. We call this the [Cartesian View](/superphysics/principles/chapter-01b/). 


### Spacetimes in the Aetherspace

Each spacetime is a static reality-perception which is glued together with other static spacetimes in order to create a flowing reality, like the pages of a flipbook:

{{< i s="/graphics/flipbook.gif" a="Flipbook" >}}

<!-- - the spacetime within perception were called "extension" and time
- the spacetime related to identities were called "space" and moment -->

- each page is a spacetime
- each book is an aetherspace
- a shelf is an alternate or parallel reality
- a library section is a universe
- a library is a multiverse  

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/spacetime.jpg" alt="Aetherspace" cap="Spacetimes together make up the aetherspace" >}}


In Superphysics, a rock moves from location `A` to location `B` by moving through different spacetimes where it gradually shifts its location from `A` in the first spacetime to `B` in the last spacetime.

It moves not because of its mass, dimensions, or force, but because of its gravitational signature which is visualized by **timespace**. 

<!-- The rock's length, width, and height and time to roll, all come from our aethereal mind's decision to perceive the rock' spacetime aspects. In other words, the spacetime of the rock existed because our aethereal mind wanted to experience it. -->

<!-- Unlike the Einstein's spacetime which is rigid and measured by the speed of light, the Superphysics spacetime is malleable. In fact, there are 4 kinds of our spacetime: 

Domain | Spacetime Sublayer | Name | Measure | Physics Name
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---   
Metaphysical | Aethereal | Mental Time | Experience | Coordinate Time (Einstein)
Physical | Radiant | Electromagnetic Time | Atomic Clock | Proper Time (Einstein)
Physical | Convertible | Radioactive Time | Radioactive Decay Clock |
Physical | Material | Material Time | Sand Clock | Absolute Time (Newton) -->
