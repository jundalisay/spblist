Newton's Univesal Law of Gravitation is written as:

`F = G(m1 m2) / r^2`

Matter-to-Matter Spatial Relationality replaces Newton's concepts with the following:

Newtoninan Concept |  Material Superphysics Replacement
--- | ---
F as force of gravity | F as volume of mosts 
G as gravitational constant | G as mosts from material bodies 
m as mass of the body | n as timespace of the body  
r as radius | r as sos or empty space

A falling body really uses both Newton's 2nd and 3rd Laws, which are combined in the 4th Rule of Descartes-Spinoza. 

The main difference is that Newtonian mechanics believes that gravity comes from matter. This is why physicists smash atoms to see where the gravity could be hiding.

But Descartes clearly wrote that gravity does not come from matter, but from the 2nd Element which are now invisible virtual spacetime particles. 

The fact that particle colliders cannot detect gravity nor dark matter in collisions is proof that Descartes is correct, and has a deeper understanding of how Nature works. 

This is then the foundation of new spacetime technologies, since the root cause of gravity (and dark matter) is already known.  

<!-- Cartesian-Spinozan Mechanics: Newton's 2nd and 3rd Laws
We replace Newton's 2nd Law and 3rd Law with the 4th rule of Descartes and Spinoza. 
A 5 kilogram cannonball falls at 9.81 meters per second. 
This is from the pushing force of the invisible spacetime particles that go up from the center of earth's vortex in a straight line.
This force is the same at the same distance from the center of a vortex.
This gives a force of 49.05 kilograms in meters per second square. -->
