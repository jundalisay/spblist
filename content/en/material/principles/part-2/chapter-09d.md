The pervious part explained the essential ingredients for Einstein's Special Relativity.

Einstein Concept | Meaning
--- | ---
`c` | A constant to create patterns
Simultaneity of time | creating movement within those patterns
Minkowski space | a space that allows c-based patterns and time 
Metric Tensor | Plotting tiny movements in the Minkowski space

These included key fallacies which actually trap reality within the radiant layer.
- the application of the constant sped of light c onto space
- the confining of time with that same c as the 'simultaneity of time' 

These led to sub-fallacies:
- Minkowski spacetime
- Metric Tensor


Material Superphysics flips some of these concepts in order to allow reality to break out of the radiant layer and into the spatial and aeterheal layers. 

Einstein Concept | Material Superphysics Replacement
--- | ---
Minkowski space | 7 dimensions 
Metric Tensor | 2D Space-Time slices 


Specifically, we fixed them by:
- applying c onto particles as particle-shapes instead of applying it onto space
- removing the reality of the 'simultaneity of time' and instead keeping it a human policy for analyzing certain phenomena
- replacing the Minkowski spacetime with 2D spacetime slices, and the Metric Tensor with the timespace particle

We deny the simultaneity of time as a real phenomenon and instead see it as the desire of the measurer to have a definite answer. For example, instead of getting the answer `1.12345` in one time, `1.1234` at another, and `1.123` at another, we can set it to a standard 3 decimal places to always come up with `1.123`.

For judging space, the timespace particle becomes the most important concept, especially since it is in the upper spatial sublayer close to the aethereal layer. This replaces mass in Newton's system and the stress-energy tensor in that of Einstein. 


## Spatial-Radiant Relationality as General Relatvity 

Here, we explain the Spatial-Radiant Relationality which is roughly similar to General Relativity of Modern Physics. 

Since humans have spent a lot of effort exploring General Relativity, we will use the data and equations from it, and then convert it to Cartesian.

As mentioned in the previous part, the main mechanism of General Relativty is the stress-energy tensor, just as that of Special Relativity is the metric tensor. Rather, the stress-energy tensor adds features for the metric tensor by adding curvatures. 

These curvatures are then the map where the moving object will go through. 

Comparing Einstein with Newton and Descartes gives us: 

Einstein | Newton | Descartes
--- | --- | ---
Metric Tensor + Cristoffel Symbols | Orbit edge | 2D Spacetime + Timespace1
Stress-Energy Tensor | Mass |  Timespace2
Riemann Curvature | Orbit interior | Relational differences between Timespace1 and Timespace2

As you can see, the Riemann Curvature, as the warping of spacetime, is the most complicated part of General Relatviity just as the relational differences between Timespace1 and Timespace2 are to Cartesian Relationality.
