Chapter 9 explained that Einstein's system for judging space is to use the metric tensor. These are small arrows that go from Point A to Point B.

But to Material Superphysics, the proper and natural way to judge the space of a cloud on Trafalgar square is to know the nature of both:
- the cloud, and
- Trafalgar square

In this way, the proper location is determined by the relative differences of those two natures.

A blind observer can know the cloud by the thunder it creates and how it compares to other sounds from Trafalgar square which he learns by experience. In this way, this system can work even without light.  


### The Aethereal, Non-Radiant, Experiential Way

Assuming Trafalgar square has four squares `A1, A2, B1, B2`. The person has existed in all squares and has heard thunder above each one, as well as above all the other squares. This leads to 16 total experiences. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/clouds.png" alt="The Superphysics way of observing" cap="The Superphysics way of observing" >}}


In this way, the person in `A1` who hears a thunder in `B2` will know its location by extracting the relation of the cloud and the area from his memory. 
- This relation is spatial relationality.

This method does away with the use of light as the measuring rod, and so it can throw away `c` and `lambda` while still being within the nature of the universe. 

<!-- In Western philosophy, the obsession with light comes from Aristotle who put sight as the supreme sense. This is opposite of the sightless observations proposed by Pythagoras and Socrates (as well as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism) which we are advancing. -->

<!-- It would be like removing the training wheels of a kid's bicycle so that the bicycle can run faster. 

Yes, c and lambda helped physicists understand the universe beyond the solar system, but it also necessarily limits the full understanding of the universe to only 5% of its visible parts -- how can anyone be proud of that? Is knowing only 5% of the universe the most crowning achievement of the human species? -->

**Instead of c, it uses the relation of the person in two states (A1 and B2) with the state of the cloud in B2.** 

Notice how this system is similar to quantum mechanics which assigns a probability to each location through a 'path integral' formulation. 


### The Francis Bacon Tables

The list of experiences of the blind man in our example allowed him to know which square the lightning came from. 

This is the same technique that spatial relationality will use in order to simplify the judgement of space. 

These experiences form a table which plots the relevant data needed to judge the space or movement in question.

Nowadays, this is known as the training data used by machine learning models. 
- The data must be cleaned to match the model. 

This means that our system will answer questions about space and movement based on training data instead of simple inputs like mass, velocity, distance, etc. 




<!-- As an alternative to general relativity, we present a draft of "gravitational relativity" derived from Kepler, as a subset of a unifying "universal relativity" from his concept of harmonic ratios.  -->

<!-- We replace the Einstein tensor with a Kepler tensor and replace equality with a ratio sign. Former constants, such as the Newtonian `G`, `c`, and `lambda` are put under `s` which represents the spatial layer. 

The stress-energy tensor is then a new `G` which usually represents mass. 

We then apply his for Mercury's precession:
- Leverrier's solution is G<sub>1(gravitational)</sub> + G<sub>1a(gravitational)</sub> : G<sub>2(gravitational)</sub>
  - This uses gravitational relativity using a hypothetical planet Vulcan  
- Einstein's solution is G<sub>1(spatial)</sub> : G<sub>2(spatial)</sub> 
  - This uses spatial relativity using the speed of light 

This shows that Leverrier's solution is valid if Vulcan existed, just as Einstein's solution is valid if Mercury's core is large. It shows that Mercury's large core gives it its elliptical orbit just as comets have an elliptical orbit. We then infer that Mercury's precession and ellipse come from its core, giving it the dynamics of a comet or asteroid more than a planet.  
 -->
<!-- This is useful for finding habitable planets in the future. --> 

<!-- and Einstein's solution is valid if the quality of the core of Mercury is ascertained. The precession of Mercury using spatial relativity is due to its core being 75% of its mass. This gives it the dynamics of a comet more than a planet.  -->
