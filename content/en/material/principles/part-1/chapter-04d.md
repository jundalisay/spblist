The book *The Grand Design* by Stephen Hawking, explains the plague of infinities that afflict the current understanding of physical particles. 

This arises from the infinite histories that Feynman diagrams can achieve.

In 1976, a possible solution to that problem was found. It is called supergravity. The prefix “super” was not appended because physicists thought it was “super” that this theory of quantum gravity might actually work. Instead, “super” refers to a kind of symmetry the theory possesses, called supersymmetry.
