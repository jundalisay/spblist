The Quantum of aether (qoa) is the monad. It is the smallest unit of an aethereal substance which takes the form of the universe.


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/monad.jpg" a="Monad" >}}

According to Pythagoras and Kepler, motion is sourced from an invisible, immaterial "monad". 

We combine this with Asian philosophy to say that monads vibrate in 3 ways according to the 3 influences or gunas:


Influence | Position 
--- | ---
Subtlifying | Above the gravitational signature
Transformative | Within the gravitational signature
Crudifying | Below the gravitational signature


These monads then make up the aether particles as the substance of the aethereal layer. The quality of these monads then build the strength, dynamism, and size of the particles in the layers below the aethereal. 


{{< q a="Descartes" c="The World Simplified" >}}
Every substance has one principal attribute.
- Mind-substances have thinking as their one principal attribute.
- Body-substances have extension as their one principal attribute.

Thus:
- extension in length, width, and depth, constitutes the nature of corporeal substance.
- thought is the nature of thinking substance

In ancient natural philosophy, the aether was called the 'substance' that filled all of Existence. 

Since it is two layers above the radiant layer which facilitates sight and touch, then it is not visible nor tangible.

It is detected in 2 ways:

1. Directly through intution

Intuitional detection of the aether is explained by Bio Superphysics. 

2. Indirectly through patterns from the visible layers 

This will be done in Material Superphysics through Qualimath.



{{< q a="Leibniz" >}}
Monads must have some qualities otherwise they would not be beings at all.. Every monad is necessarily different from every other monad.

<!-- Kepler lists 5 kinds of monads: 2 are of the immaterial category and 3 are material. Instead of calling them cube, tetrahedron, etc we call them do, re, mi, sol, la, as Pythagoras' "sesquialter" and the Chinese pentatonic scale. 

"Do" is the monad of planets, "Sol" is the monad of stars such as our sun. Thus, "La" is the monad of galaxies.

Kepler calls the gravity between the monads as "kinship". -->
<!-- , Einstein calls it "relativity".  -->

<!-- Instead of using light as a yardstick, Kepler uses the gravitational relativity between two monads. There are 20, such as:
- Do-Do
- Do-Re
- Do-Mi
- etc. 

Newton's Gravity is therefore `Do-Do` and `Do-Sol`. 

Einstein's Special Relativity is `Mi-Mi` and `Mi-Re`. 

General Relativity is `Mi-Do` and `Mi-Sol`.

Monads of the same category attract each other at the same rate. 

This is why stars move at the same speed around the center of their galaxy regardless of their distance, just as 2 different weights fall to the ground at the same time as proven by Galileo.

A person ignorant of gravitational relativities will imagine that heavier objects fall faster, just as Vera Rubin imagined that a galaxy's inner stars travel faster than its outer ones.

This means that there are two inverse square laws: one for the material and another for the immaterial. These render dark matter, wormholes, and the big bang unnecessary, and will allow artificial gravity to be realized. -->



<!-- This free aether is made up of monads which are the most basic unit in existence. 

- In Yogananda's philosophy, this is the lifetron 
- In Essassani philosophy, this is called the prime radiant. 


1. Upper Qoa

This is known as the abstract mind. This is essential for both natural and artificial intelligence. 

2. Qoa

This is known as waves whether they be crudified into gravitational waves, energy waves, or light waves

3. Lower Qoa

This is known as ideas (from the Supreme's perspective) or thoughts from our perspective.

### The Upper Qoa

This is the abstract lower mind that allows the waves and thoughts to be manifest themselves. 

This leads to true artificial intelligence which we call Automated Natural Intelligence.

<!-- Everyone has had an idea. Therefore, ideas are real, but not physical in nature. These ideas then spur us into action in the physical domain.

From the Creator's viewpoint a qoa is Its idea. From a createe's viewpoint, it is a thought. -->
