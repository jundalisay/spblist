The substance of the aether is simply called the aether. This has 3 versions:


Name | Quality
--- | ---
Universe | This is the physical universe that has all the identities
Aether | This makes up the 4 Lower Layers, as the root idea of identities
Free Aether | This is the crude version of the aether that leads to antimatter


The most common name for the aether is idea, which is the basis of identity. 

In Physics, this identity is known as 'unit'. 

A quantum is the smallest unit. 

And so the aether is really a quantum, leading to Quantum Physics. 

The 3 types of Physics fits into our 5 Layer Model:

Layer | Physics
--- | ---
Aether | Quantum Physics 
Radiant | Einstein Physics
Material | Classical Physics

However, we use the term aether in order to separate our system from the assumptions in Quantum Physics.
