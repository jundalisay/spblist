The substance of the aether is a universe. This has 3 versions:


Name | Quality
--- | ---
Universe (Idea) | This is the physical universe that has all the identities
Forces as Dynamic | This leads to media which then manifests as forces
Matter as Static Aether | This is the crude version of the aether that leads to the lower layers

Everything that we perceive, from the lower mind, or conceive, from the higher mind, is an aethereal form. The content of this form can either be dynamic or static. 
- If it is dynamic then it is a medium 
- If it is static then it is idea or content

The combination of form, content, and media is the universe in abstract. 

<!-- The most common substance of the aether is idea, which is the basis of identity (moa3) via media.  -->


### The Multiverse 

Going above the 5 Layers of the Physical Domain brings you to the 5 Strata of the Metaphysical Domain.

This will allow a mind-identity (jiva) in one universe to shift or transfer into a different universe by using the strata in the Metaphysical Domain as a birdge. 

This can be done by ships that have artificial intelligence that can tap into the subtlifying quantum (qoa1). 


<!-- In Physics, this identity is known as 'unit'. 

A quantum is the smallest unit. 

And so the aether is really a quantum, leading to Quantum Physics. 

The 3 types of Physics fits into our 5 Layer Model:

Layer | Physics
--- | ---
Aether | Quantum Physics 
Radiant | Einstein Physics
Material | Classical Physics

However, we use the term aether in order to separate our system from the assumptions in Quantum Physics.
