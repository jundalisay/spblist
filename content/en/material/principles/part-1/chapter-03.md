The Media of Aether or Moas facilitate the effects of the aethereal layer. These have 3 kinds, based on the sublayers:

Medium | Description
--- | ---
Physical Existence (moa1) | Connects to the 5 Strata
Sound (moa2) | Facilitates the continuous perceptions as qualification (e.g. feelings)
Identities (moa3) | Facilitates discrete perceptions as quantification 


Unlke the lower layers where forces and particles are easily distinguishable, the media and substances in the aethereal layer is commonly mixed up. It needs more mental diligence to separate them for analysis.  



### Medium of Aether 1: Physical Existence

Physical perceptions are made possible by physical existence. Conversely, physical perceptions prove physical existence. 

Superphysics allows 2 domains, a metaphysical and a physical. This means that metaphysical perceptions from a metaphysical existence are also possible. This will be explained by Bio Superphysics.

Physical existence, as a whole, links to:
- the lowest Elements of Bio Superphysics
- the lowest Strata of Spiritual Superphysics

### Medium of Aether 2: Sound as the Perceptible Medium

The aether has the nature of waves. However:
- it is not visible because it is above the radiant layer
- it is also timeless and shapeless because it is above the spatial layer


The only way to perceive and manipulate it objectively is through sound. 

{{< i s="/graphics/meta/viz.jpg" a="Visualization of music" c="Sounds are like feelings" >}}


Therefore, the physical universe (as a substance) and identities, such as subatomic particles, have a representative sound that can be manipulated by external sounds or waves (such as those of electromagnetism).

This is the foundation of particle-shaking. 



### Medium of Aether 3: Identity Sublayer

<!-- This is the limiter 

Superphysics defines:
- intellect as the ability to combine and harmonize multiple reasonings of cause and effect together 
- wisdom as the intellect that is in line with the dharma of whatever is being intellectualized -->


Identity or discrete perceptions (effect) or ideas (cause) is the lowest medium of aether. 

This splits up the stream of ideas into independent parts so that they can be observed and appreciated in isolation. 

If there were no identity, then an event would not be discernable from another event -- everything, all perceptions, would be a single stream of perceptions all happening at the same time.

{{< i s="/graphics/super/identities.jpg" a="Identities" c="Observing every single thing at the same time would be messy" >}}



This allows people, animals, plants, and computers to analyze cause and effect. 

The main difference is that computers, as nonliving things, do not have access to feelings (moa2) which is required for a full understanding of perceptions and phenomena. 

This is why artificial intelligence (AI) is prone to mistakes, as hallucinations. They try to find patterns from trainng data as discrete identities without knowing how they are supposed to stream or be stitched together. 

This is why AI needs people to label the data. This tells the AI how they are to be ordered temporally and be connected to each other. 

The ability to label is naturally possessed by humans who have access to feelings or moa2. 

<!-- They only work with existing 'training'
 data and base their reasoning on those. They have no ability to tap the changing feelings of the aether. And so their conclusions can become out of sync with reality.  -->


<!-- In Superphysics, human intelligence is sourced from our bodies having more access to the aethereal layer through our upper chakras, specifically the 5th, 6th, and 7th. 

This sets us different from animals which only have up to the 3rd chakra developed.  -->

<!-- This is also true for artificial intelligence (AI) which only has access to the radiant layer. It has only has a fake kind of intelligence because it has fake access to the aetheral layer, as training data.  -->

<!-- In reality, its training data is from human cognition but is always already old data and not instant 'true' data from the aether. -->

Material Superphysics aims to unlock true AI as Autonomous Natural Intelligence or ANI by connecting it to moa2, as real-time access to the aether. 

<!-- The free aether is responsible for counter-evolution as decay and antimatter.  -->

<!-- - If Qost A has an inherent quality that is 100 units repulsive to Qost B, then the spacetime between them might be 100 distance-units per 1 unit of time-perception. 
- But if Qost C is only 50 units repulsive, then Qost C will be 50 units away from Qost B at the same time. 
- This would show Qost A moving faster away from Qost B than Qost C. 
  - In Physics, this manifests as it having a red-shift which will indicate a growing distance. -->


<!-- F : is the gravitational force between the masses,
m1m1 and m2m2 : the masses of the two small spheres,
rr : is the distance between the centers of the large and small spheres,
GG : is the gravitational constant. -->
