{{< q a="Kybalion" >}}
This says that all manifested things have 2 sides, 2 aspects, 2 poles, a pair of opposites with manifold degrees between the 2 extremes.
{{< /q >}}


The polarities in the Aethereal Layer are:

Positive | Negative
--- | ---
Dharma | Adharma
Dynamism | Staticity


Note that the Physical Domain is inherently Negative. 



<!-- The constant action by the Positive and Negative Force on Substance which we call Quantum create a polarity or duality* on each substance or quantum, which then manifests as a particle or a wave. 

{{< n n="*'Duality' emphasizes the opposite-ness, while 'Polarity' emphasizes their mutual belligerence" >}}



We say that each quantum exists with a set charge or predisposition from the very beginning. This polarity is called differently in each Layer.


Layer | Positive Vortex | Negative Vortex
---- | --- | ---
Probability | Existing | Non-Existing
Aethereal | Unifying |  Divisive
Spatial | Counterclockwise Rotation | Clockwise Rotation
Radiant | Male (Positive Charge) | Female (Negative Charge)
Convertible | Left Chirality | Right Chirality  
Material | Color Charge (Matter) | Anti-Color Charge (Antimatter) -->



In the aethereal layer, this polarity is the tendency to divide versus the tendency to unite. 

- The positive manifests as "like attracting like"
- The negative manifests as "opposites repelling"

We use the following words for these poles:

Pole | Associated Words
--- | ---
Positive | Good, Unite, Peace, Cooperate, Synthesize, Understand, etc
Negative | Bad, Divide, War, Compete, Analyze, Confuse, etc


### Enlightenment and the Aether Dash, Maya and the Aether Drag

Since the lower parts of the aethereal layer is mostly about information, we can use:
- learning, as vidya, as an example of the positive force   
  - The push towards knowledge and realization we call the aether dash
- ignorance, as maya, as an example of the negative force
  - The slowness of knowledge we call the aether drag

<!-- This principle is most seen in Medical Superphysics where homeopathy uses likes to cure -->



<!-- Layer | Physics Polarity Name | Superphysics Name | Effect
--- | --- | --- | ---
Probability | ? | Existing or Non-Existing | Exist or Not Exist
Aethereal | ? | Positive or Negative Disposition |  Attract or Repel
Spatial | ? | Clockwise or Anticlockwise Rotation | Materialize or Dematerialize
Radiant | Positive or Negative Charge | Male or Female Charge | Attract or Repel
Convertible | Left Hand or Right Hand Chirality | Clockwise or Anticlockwise Rotation | Transform or Not Transform
Material | Left Hand or Right Hand Chirality | Clockwise or Anticlockwise Rotation | Materialize or Dematerialize 
 -->

<!-- Unity or Disunity

In Physics, energy leads to the concept of entropy which is the order or disorder of systems. 

Instead of order or disorder, Superphysics uses the words 'unity' or 'disunity'. This is most useful in the aethereal layer where sounds can be united in a chorus, or disunited as noise.

It would be better to say that a family, society, or sports team is 'united' instead of 'orderly'. Similarly, a car is united when all its parts are kept together, and disunited when it suffers a car crash or is left to rust. 

- Unity is facilitated by the Positive Force of Nature
  - This is called Yang in Taoism and Shiva in Hinduism.   
- Disunity is facilitated by the Negative Force of Nature.
  - This is called Yin in Taoism and Shakti in Hinduism.
