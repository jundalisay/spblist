The previous part explained waves as a flow. Here we represent waves as an identity, as a shaped particle.

We categorize these shapes into 5, as the 5 Elements or Layers.


### Monads make up an Aether particle

We use the monad as the unifying wave or particle for both Material Superhysics and Bio Superphysics. 

Since monads are subjective and not objective, we will not discuss monads here. The only concept that we need is that a monad makes up an aether particle. It is the aether that makes up all other particles. 


Layer | Aether Content
--- | --- |
Aethereal | 5
Spatial | 4
Radiant | 3
Convertible | 2
Material | 1

This is why we call the Aether as the 5th Element or Layer, and Matter as the 1st. 
- The waves more obviously take on a particle-shape and behavior from the Radiant Layer to the Material.
- The waves stay as waves in the Aethereal and Spatial Layers.


### The Signature or Dharma and the Sublayers 

Each particle represents a wave. Each wave moves up and down, as amplitude, from its zero level.

We call this zero or average level as the **central signature or dharma** for that wave.

This means that a wave has 3 kinds depending on its relation to that central signature. It can be:
- above that level
- within that level
- below that level

These lead to 3 subelements or sublayers for each Element or Layer.




### The Shapes

Dynamic waves are hard to visualize. This is why we use shapes to represent them. This is the technique used by Descartes who got the idea from Plato. 

In the Asian sciences, the shapes are called mandalas and yantras. 

The major tones form general shapes when they are visualized in the same way that audio is visualized by modern mp3 players. This is why Plato organized them into 5 shapes. However, we differ a bit because we base our shape in the aether content:

Layer | Aether content | Greek Shape | Superphysics Shape
--- | --- | --- | ---
5 Aethereal | 5 units | Dodecahedron  | Pentagon
4 Spatial |  4 | Octahedron | Square
3 Radiant | 3 | Tetrahedron | Line or Triangle
2 Convertible | 2 | Icosahedron | Dash 
1 Material | 1 | Cube | Sphere

Note that these shapes are NOT how those forces and particles exist in actuality. These are just representations that help the human mind understand the dynamics of those forces and particles which are actually in a compound wave format. 

This is similar to musical notes representing the actual sound waves of a song. 

This is also similar to programming languages being in English even if computers talk in binary and machine language. For example, the Javacript snippet `declare global {namespace App}` uses English words even if its output is ultimately code that software can understand, but humans cannot.  


These shapes are helpful in understanding why the fundamental forces act in the way that they do. 

For example, the 2D nature of photons allow them to go through the 2D spacetime unhindered. They are only hindered by the aetherspace which is 3D and limits them to 300,000 kilometers per second. 

This will be fully explained in Chapter 5.
