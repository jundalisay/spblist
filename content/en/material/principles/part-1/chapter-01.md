The aethereal layer is the first and highest layer in our 5 layers model and will be known as the Fifth Force in Modern Physics.

### Definition of the Aethereal Layer

The aethereal layer of the 5 Layers Model of Material Superphysics is the substance of the physical and quasi-physical universe. 

It is a bit different from the aether of the 5 Strata Model of Bio Superphysics which is the substance of ideas, feelings, and abstract minds or souls. 

The 5 Layers aether is made up of monads which are its "quantum" particle.

The ancient Greeks, Kepler, Descartes, and the Asian sciences (Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism) all attributed all the motions in the universe to God through it. In Hinduism, the aether is the *akasha*.

{{< q a="Descartes" c="The World by Descartes Simplified, Chapter 5" >}}
The philosophers assure us that above the clouds there is an aethereal air much subtler than ours. That air is not composed of vapors of the earth, but is an element in itself

{{< q a="Socrates" c="Simple Phaedo by Plato, Chapter 9" >}}
But the true earth is pure and situated in the pure heaven—there are the stars also. It is the heaven which we commonly call the aether. Our own earth is the sediment gathering in the hollows beneath it.

### The Aether Dominates and is the Most Subtle

The aether is the highest and most important layer in the universe. It is the start of existence in the quasi-physical domain (since the previous layer is Probability which is only theoretical).

This layer dominates and rules the other four layers, just like spacetime dominates light as to give it a speed limit, and electromagnetism dominates matter as to prevent two rocks from merging or passing through each other. 

In terms of creation, this layer is the first layer that precedes physical manifestation. Since it is above spacetime, it is beyond Einstein's rule that nothing can travel faster than light. Thus, time travel and teleportation to other multiverses is facilitated by this layer.

We write aether with an "a" to differentiate it from the *ether* of science. This is similar to writing dialectics as "Socratic Dialectics" to set it apart from the corrupted dialetics of Marx. 


### Matter and Force are One as Idea

In the 3 lowest layers of Material, Conversion, and Radiance, force particles are seperate from matter particles. 

But in the 2 highest layers, the Spatial and Athereal, the force and matter are interchangeable. In the highest layer, they are one and the same. 



<!-- Einstein claims that the Michelson and Morley experiment disproved the ether. In reality, it merely proved that the aether does not reside in the spacetime layer, but in its own layer as the aethereal layer. -->
