Reality is made up of waves | Waves are either a flow or an identity 
{{< /dc >}}



Material Superphysics is based on waves because the universe is made up of waves.

A wave can be seen either:
- as a flow, as the 2nd Aethereal Sublayer or
- as an identity, as the 3rd Aethereal Sublayer

As a flow, we call it energy. However, to keep the proper demarcation between the physical and metaphysical domains, we all energy in the aethereal layer as "effort".

<!--  which can manifest as:
- heat
- light
- sound
- feelings, etc.  -->


Energy has 4 Laws based on its flow. This now manifests as the 4 Laws of Thermodynamics. Supersociology and Supereconomics use the same principle:

<!-- to plot the cycles of society -->

Thermodynamics Law | Supersociology/economics Law | Meaning
--- | --- | ---
3rd Law | 1st Law | The wave has a base
1st Law | 2nd Law | The wave maintains its wave-ness instead of fizzling out. This leads to our perceptions (and matter) persisting instead of vanishing instantly
0th Law | 3rd Law (zero energy) | The wave having regular wavelengths instead of random ones. This is consistent with the previous law
2nd Law (entropy) | 4th Law | The wave going forward. This creates the concept of linear time or perceptions coming at a sequence

<!-- Property | Thermodynamics | Supersociology | Supereconomics 
--- | --- | --- | ---
Continuity or Balance | 0th law | Thinker | 3rd Law 
Conservation | 1st law | Warrior | 2nd Law
Spread | 2nd law  | Traders | 4th Law
Measure or Range | 3rd law  | Worker | 1st Law -->

- The 2nd and 1st law of thermodynamics refer to the external aspects of the wave
- The 3rd and 0th laws refer to the internal aspects

In Superphysics, the internals are the cause of the externals and so the internals are more important.

In Social Superphysics, this is why the Intellectual (Thinking) and Working classes are more important than the Business (Trading) and Warrior Classes.


### Waves as Sound The Octave vs the Pentatonic Scale

The ancients classified these waves into 5 depending on their shapes (which represent their frequency) which will be discussed in full in the next chapter.

Each of the 5 layers has a sound which represents the wave of that layer. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/doremi.jpg" alt="Universal sounds" >}}

This gives us frequencies:

Element | Layer | Note | Frequency
--- | --- | --- | ---
Aether | Aether | Ti | ?
Air | Spacetime | La | ? 
Fire | Radiant | Sol | ?
Water | Convertible | Fa | ?
Earth | Material | Do | 130.81


The question-marks above will test whether the following notes to impact the corresponding layer. We only could do tests on material objects and so we can set 130 Hz as the base for the rest. 

The totality of the universe, combining the physical and metaphysical, have 8 tones as the octave of the Greeks and the Bagua of the Chinese.


These tones manifest as waves such as pulse. 

By checking a patient's pulse, the traditional Chinese doctor checks the wave of that person through his own feelings. Likewise, the homeopath checks this wave through the electrical current that he runs through his patient. 

<!-- The Greeks on the other hand, used eight sounds to represent the five layers. Three, do-re-mi (C-D-E), are for the lower three layers, while fa-so-la-ti-do (F-G-A-B) are for the spatial and aethereal layers. C and G were common in Western Classical Music.   -->

This sound or wave system is the only way to judge and measure the aethereal layer, as well as give the complete picture of the spatial layer. This is because light and sight are useless in the invisible aethereal layer and not 100% useful in the spatial layer.

For example, Galileo demonstrated that two objects with different weights *visually* fall to the ground at the same time, at the same speed. However, those two objects *make different sounds*. The difference of their resulting sounds then will indicate the differences in the nature of their gravitational signature. 

Layer | Transition
--- | ---
Aethereal | Idea into Aethereal Wave
Spacetime | Aethereal Wave into Physical Wave
Radiant (Electromagnetic) | Physical Wave into Emitted Particles
Convertible | Emitted Particles into Matter
Material | Matter into Identity
