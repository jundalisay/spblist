Aethereal Effort or Action is based on Spin. 
- Spin is based on internal configuration or gravitational signature
- Spin happens when there is a match between the external media and the internal configuration, leading to energy to flow into the identity. 


The movement between identities happens through their relational differences, as Cartesian Relationality.
- Some relations are attractive
- Others are repulsive



### Converting Newtonian Force into Aethereal Effort

Physics already knows that the Newtonian `F = m a` can be converted into Lagrangian.

Instead of Lagrangian, we use Relationality to show how effort causes movement. 

Since this technically happens in the Material Layer, we will explain it [here](/material/principles/part-5/chapter-03c).


### Action at a Distance Through Aethereal Effort

The most natural and historical proof the the aether as a motive force is the levitation of Buddhist monks. 
- This violates the `F = ma` by Neweton since there is no contact force being applied 
- This violates Einstein's warping since there is no warping of space above the monk 

<!-- According to Newton's Second Law, net force equals mass times acceleration. This is fine for ordinary things like a ball (mass) which is pushed (force) to start rolling (acceleration).  -->

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/francis.jpg" alt="A monk levitating" cap="In Cartesian Physics, dark energy is the constant division of spacetime. Gravity is the relationality of sub-mass to a main mass. In this image, the monk is the sub-mass and the Earth is the main mass. Gravity is the metaphysical elastic band between the two." >}}


Assume that a 50 kilogram yogini woman floats and stays up 1 meter off the ground for 10 seconds. 

 <!-- consi accelerates 1 meter/second {{< s v="2" >}} without any force? How can `0 = 50 1m/s^2`?    -->



To account for this, we modify Newton's `F = ma` into our Eagle as `E::Gl`. 

{{< i s="/graphics/super/egl.jpg" a="The Eagle" >}}

We then convert that Eagle with Cartesian Relationality by splitting the 2 identities apart: 

`1E Woman : 6,371,001 m : 0E Earth`

- E Woman represents the effort of the woman to change its aethereal relation with the Earth 
- E Earth represents the effort of the Earth to change its aethereal relation with the woman
- The number in the middle represents the distance between the 2 identities

<!-- A 2D limiter that splits perceptions into seconds will convert `F = ma` on Earth into `Gm^1 [GP second] : Gm^2 [GP second]` based on the Earth's perspective `GP`*
 ![Newton's second law of motion](/graphics/physics/fma.png) -->

The woman changes her distance from the center of the Earth by 1 meter by changing her aethereal relation with the Earth.

Unlike Newtonian contact forces which are applied at the exterior of the body, the aethereal forces are triggered internally. 

<!-- monk `m` in location `x1` floats to location `x2` by successfully changing its state or perspective `Gm` relative to that of the Earth `GP`. The new force, as a **Aethereal Effort**, then results or is derived from the difference between the two states, which may be larger or smaller than the old physical Force.  E = Gm2 [GP second] - Gm1 [GP second] -->

This is the same principle used by the UFO as mentioned by Bob Lazar which we assume can levitate 100 meters off the ground with 1 unit of Effort.

`1E UFO : 6,371,100 m : 0E Earth`

The main difference between the woman and the UFO is that:
- the woman uses chi, as the spatial strata in Bio Superphysics
- the UFO uses the aetherspace which Bob Lazar calls Gravity-A waves

The spatial layer is divided into discrete sublayers. This leads to a difference between spacetime and the aetherspace. 

However, the spatial strata is not as discrete (or at least we have no ability yet to see the internal divisions and complexities of strata). This is why, for now, we can think of chi as a single layer. 



### Similarities and Differences With Lagrangian Mechanics

Cartesian Mechanics is similar to Lagrangian Mechanics in the following ways:
- Both focus on the internal action or effort instead of the external forces
- The integrals of Euler lead to spacetime slices, while the multipliers of Lagrange allow the flexbility of those slices

Cartesian Mechanics is different from Lagrangian Mechanics in the following ways:
- It does not focus on paths
- It focuses on spin and relationality which Lagrangian does not seem to have


<!-- The Effort of the UFO is really the harnessing and increase of this aetherspace to violate or re-render the spacetime slices that it is in -->

<!-- Thus, it took 1 unit of effort to levitate 1 meter/second^2 with zero physical force. 

Note that this quantified effort is relevant only to the monk himself and cannot be used for comparison with the effort of other monks. It can only be compared to the past and future effort of that monk, where he compares himself with himself since the effort is metaphysical and bound to his own mind*.
