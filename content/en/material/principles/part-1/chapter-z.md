Bernoulli a staunch Cartesian. 

Principle of Least Effort to emphasize that the movement is sourced from inherent starting impulse on that body by the aether. This matches economics maximize a ideal economy. productive . 

Path of least effort is bilateral relationality. Is not the speed of light, but the inherent effort of the body. It is because both masses have . 

corruption by Hamilton. Colors lead to teleportation. This is how UFOs create a teleportation map by comparing the changing color ratios of all the stars to determine which configuration of the aetherspace can teleport them to the target star.   

We reject the Hamiltonain corruption of Lagrange as being the same corruption of Einstein on Lorentz' lenght contraction.
