### The Creation of Matter

Matter is created inside a steller vortex and is spread to the galaxy through dissociation which is either instant or gradual.


{{< q a="Sarkar" c="Idea and Ideology" >}}
Structural Dissociation happens when celestial bodies lose vital energy. This can be instantaneous or gradual.
{{< /q >}}


1. Instant

This happens when the Negative Force keeps on imposing itself on a lifeless, matter-filled, heavenly body. This results in a supernova.

A living heavenly body is one whose core is not yet filled with matter, but rather has the convertible, radiant, spatial, and aethereal layers still active.   


2. Gradual 

This happens when the Negative Force slowly creeps into a living celestial body through its spaces or qosts.


{{< q a="Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia, Part 3, Article 116" >}}
There is no danger of any vortex being destroyed by neighboring vortices as long as the star at its center is not enveloped by spots. But when a star becomes covered and buried by sunspots, its fate depends solely on its position relative to other vortices as to whether it will be absorbed sooner or later.

<!-- Nothing else can maintain Vortex N in its current position except for the great force of the fire-aether of its N-star. It propels the surrounding air-aether globules so that they follow its impulse rather than the movements of neighboring vortices. This force is weakened and broken by the intervention of spots. -->


Both instantaneous and gradual dissociation converts the celestial body back into the component 5  layers.


The dissociation of stellar vortices spreads both organic and inorganic matter a galaxy. 

Organic matter then becomes the vehicle for life when combined with the Positive Force emitted by a star. This is evidenced on earth by the patterns of the spread of certain viruses that follow the patterns of starlight.

The evolution of life will be discussed by Bio Superphysics.


### The Creation of Planets

Planets are stellar vortices that failed to become stars. 

A stellar system being born has many vortices around a central vortex. The weaker ones get absorbed into the stronger ones. This leads to the following known outcomes:

- 2 strong vortices as binary stars, and weaker vortices as planets. This is the most common.
- 1 strong vortex as a star, and many weaker vortices.
- 1 strong vortex alone. This is rare and is seen in Vega.

The dynamics of planets such as plate tectonics will be discussed in the Material Layer.


<!-- - Phase 3: The electromagnetic layer turns the clumped energy into electrons or "quantum of electricity" (qoe) and photons "quantum of light" (qol) 
- Phase 4: The weak force of the Convertible layer turn the electrons into neutrons "quantum of radioactivity" (qor)
- Phase 5: The strong force turn neutrons into protons as quarks (quantum of matter or qom) via gluons --> 

<!-- These lead to the first shining stars. The protons in them then make up the basic elements which are then spread throughout space through the explosion of the qost, as a supernova. The exploded matter and unconverted energy are then re-clumped in the same qost to repeat the process until all the energy is converted into matter.  -->


<!--  gravitational layer as "quanta of spacetime". This allowed the idea to have "space" after other ideas came down with it. For example, "1" alone has no space. But "1 and 1" necessarily creates a space between the two 1's. 

We can say that the space between the two 1's are made up of zeros or empty 1's. So instead of "1 and 1", we now have "100001". -->   

<!-- To be created, each object is assigned a place in the computer's memory as a block. A large app needs more memory and uses more blocks than a tiny app. Likewise, the universe is made up of such placeholder blocks which we call quanta of spacetime or qost*. -->

<!-- > *The original Pythagorean version is "monad". The original Hindu version is "jiva". We use "quantum" to emphasize that these are totally based on human perceptions. This means that animals or aliens might see stars and blackholes in a totally different way with different dynamics. Our qosts, therefore, are only for the human perspective. Other species might sense creation in other ways.  -->
