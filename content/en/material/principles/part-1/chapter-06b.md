The constant belligerence of the 2 Forces creates vortices in the 5 Layers which is called spin by Modern Physics. 

This has the following characteristics:

1. Rotation Direction
2. Rotation Speed
3. Rotation Strength
4. Momentum (within the Spatial Layer)
5. Momentum Strength 

All of these are in relation to other spins.
