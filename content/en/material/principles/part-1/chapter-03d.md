The Media of the Aether are:

1. Physical Existence
2. Sounds 
3. Identities 

These move everything in the physical and metaphysical domains. These 3 are made up of waves and are not particles. These do not even have size, shape, age, or timespan because they are above the spatial layer. 

Instead, they create movement or non-movement by engaging or disengaging from the perceived waves. This leads to action-at-a-distance, which is the opposite of material contact forces.

Action-at-a-distance is possible because, in the paradign of Descartes, Aristotle, and the Asian sciences of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism, there is no Void in Nature. 
- This means that empty space is filled with substances that facilitate action-at-a-distance.


Newtonian Mechanics embraces Democritus' matter-based philosophy which is the opposite that of Descartes.

Therefore the first-beginnings are of solid singleness

Instead of space being filled:
- Newton ascribed gravity to an invisible gravitational force coming from matter
- Einstein ascribed gravity to an invisible spacetime that warps


### Action at a Distance through Aethereal Effort

The most natural and historical proof the the aether as a motive force is the levitation of Buddhist monks. 
- This violates the `F = ma` by Neweton since there is no contact force being applied 
- This violates Einstein's warping since there is no warping of space above the monk 

<!-- According to Newton's Second Law, net force equals mass times acceleration. This is fine for ordinary things like a ball (mass) which is pushed (force) to start rolling (acceleration).  -->

Assume that a 50 kilogram yogini woman floats and stays up 1 meter off the ground for 10 seconds. 

 <!-- consi accelerates 1 meter/second {{< s v="2" >}} without any force? How can `0 = 50 1m/s^2`?    -->

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/francis.jpg" alt="A monk levitating" cap="In Cartesian Physics, dark energy is the constant division of spacetime. Gravity is the relationality of sub-mass to a main mass. In this image, the monk is the sub-mass and the Earth is the main mass. Gravity is the metaphysical elastic band between the two." >}}

To account for this, we modify Newton's `F = ma` into our Eagle as `E::Gl`. 

{{< i s="/graphics/super/egl.jpg" a="The Eagle" >}}

We then convert that Eagle with Cartesian Relationality by splitting the 2 identities apart: 

`1E Woman : 6,371,001 m : 0E Earth`

- E Woman represents the effort of the woman to change its aethereal relation with the Earth 
- E Earth represents the effort of the Earth to change its aethereal relation with the woman
- The number in the middle represents the distance between the 2 identities 


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/effort.jpg" a="Effort" >}}


<!-- A 2D limiter that splits perceptions into seconds will convert `F = ma` on Earth into `Gm^1 [GP second] : Gm^2 [GP second]` based on the Earth's perspective `GP`*
 ![Newton's second law of motion](/graphics/physics/fma.png) -->

The woman changes her distance from the center of the Earth by 1 meter by changing her aethereal relation with the Earth.

Unlike Newtonian contact forces which are applied at the exterior of the body, the aethereal forces are triggered internally. 

<!-- monk `m` in location `x1` floats to location `x2` by successfully changing its state or perspective `Gm` relative to that of the Earth `GP`. The new force, as a **Aethereal Effort**, then results or is derived from the difference between the two states, which may be larger or smaller than the old physical Force.  E = Gm2 [GP second] - Gm1 [GP second] -->

This is the same principle used by the UFO as mentioned by Bob Lazar which we assume can levitate 100 meters off the ground with 1 unit of Effort.

`1E UFO : 6,371,100 m : 0E Earth`

The main difference between the woman and the UFO is that the woman uses chi, as the spatial strata in Bio SUperphysics, whereas the UFO uses the aetherspace which Bob Lazar calls Gravity-A waves. The Effort of the UFO is really the harnessing and increase of this aetherspace to violate or re-render the spacetime slices that it is in

<!-- Thus, it took 1 unit of effort to levitate 1 meter/second^2 with zero physical force. 

Note that this quantified effort is relevant only to the monk himself and cannot be used for comparison with the effort of other monks. It can only be compared to the past and future effort of that monk, where he compares himself with himself since the effort is metaphysical and bound to his own mind*.
