Material Superphysics perfects science by completing the 5 Elements, as Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Aether, that make up reality. 

- Newton systematized the Earth Element (Matter) as Classical Mechanics based on mass or the amount of matter in a body
- Maxwell systematized the Fire Element (Electromagnetism) as Maxwell's equations that lead to electricity and magnetism
- Feynman systematized the Water Element (Weak Force) through his diagrams and spin
- Lorentz-Poincare systematized the Air Element (Spacetime) with Poincare's Law of Relativity and Lorentz' length contraction 
- Descartes-Spinoza systematized the Aether with their Substance, via aethereal animal spirits

This aethereal Substance then connects to the Asian sciences:

- Taoism's animal spirits are called chi and are fundamental to chi gong and Traditional Chinese medicine
- Hinduism's animal spirits are called prana and are fundamental in Ayurveda and yoga, as well as levitating monks and clairvoyance (i.e. bringing the mind to a future spacetime) 

Below are the proposed technologies to be developed, arrnaged by Element or Layer:


## Earth Element / Material Layer 

### Anti-Matter Power

This can be achieved by creating a new element that is readily unstable upon the addition of a single proton or neutron.

This requires a master of the aetherspace of an atom. 

This is inspired by the anti-matter reactor of the Bob Lazar UFO which was said to use Element 115.

In the beginning, we hypothesized that such an Element could be created in a nuclear fusion reactor. However, upon learning of the properties of the aetherspace, we realized it needed to be made with far more sophisticated control of the lower aether, instead of through brute force with energy.  


### Precision Fabrication / Metallurgy

Current fabrication techniques require abrasives, drills, and contact cutters that damage the parts and create imperfections. Even cutting by liquids might not create perfect parts.

Our idea is to use spacetime particles for fabrication since they, by nature, travel in straight lines.

## Water Element / Convertible Layer

### Nuclear Fusion

Currently, prototype fusion reactors use magnetic confinement which uses more electricity than the reactor generates. Our idea is to use anti-gravity to levitate and confine the plasma.

### Nuclear Negation

There have been experiments on using sound to extinguish fires. Our idea is that they can be used to extinguish nuclear chain reactions in reactors that have had meltdown. 




## Fire Element / Radiant Layer (Electromagnetic)

### Crystal Computers

While modern science seems to be going for quantum computers, our idea is to go for crystal computers based on Descartes' Dioptrique. 

Crystals allow light which travel faster than electrons. This can solve the problem with Moore's Law which is estimated to end by 2036.

## Air Element / Spatial Layer

### Spacetime Power

This will bring back Nikola Tesla's idea to harness energy from space. We add to this by clearing up the mechanism as the invisible spacetime particles which zip through reality.

Throughout space there is kinetic energy.. Crookes came the nearest to harnessing the kinetic energy in space.

### Prelevitation

The imposition of the aether onto the timespace of the object can help its reaction to the spacetime particles emitted by the Earth. This will reduce its weight.

We call this passive prelevitation. 

This can be useful for the construction industry and was used by ancient Egyptians for that purpose. 

Active prelevitation will be done by organic bodies, and is the topic for Bio Superphysics. 


### Levitation

In order to shallowly levitate, prelevitation can be increased.

However, in order to seriously levitate at great speeds, the object must be enclosed in an aetherspace so that it will be isolated from the external spacetime. In other words, the object gains the quantum properties of a  proton when inside its own aetherspace.

Evidence of this being possible is from the Bob Lazar UFO of the Grays which had a heart-shaped aetherspace which he calls Gravity-A Wave which is phase-shifted to normal spacetime or Gravity-B Wave. This phase-shifting is done through active levitation through the 3 gravity-wave emitters at the bottom of the ship.

A more advanced version is passive levitation inside an aetherspace. This is reportedly done by the Essassani civilization which is more advanced than the Grays. 


### Teleportation

Teleportation is already done by quantum mechanics on particles. Our idea is to use the aetherspace to make objects assume proton qualities, allowing them to be teleported across vast distances. This is already done by the Essassani. 


### Galactic Lighthouses

Teleportation to other stars will require a pre-set navigation system. For this, our idea is a network of crystal computers called "Stellar Eyes" that act as beacons for teleporting spaceships.

## Aethereal Element / Layer

### Autonomous Natural Intelligence (ANI)

Unlike current artificial intelligence which uses large amounds of data and processing power, ANI will use two things:

1. Timespace of the producers of the data
2. Cartesian Relativity 

In theory, this will produce machine learning models that will allow near-sentience. 


Future chapters will explain the methodology, project plan, or proposed sprints for each one.
