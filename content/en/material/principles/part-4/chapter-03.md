The Media of Convertibility facilitates the dynamics of the convertible layer. It manifests as:


Name | Medium Name 
--- | --- 
W- Boson | moc1 
W+ Boson | moc2 
Z Boson | moc3   


Convertible Relationality explains how the Convertible Layer changes particles. In Physics, this is done by the Feynman diagrams.
