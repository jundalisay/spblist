The duality of the Material Layer, as the expression of the Positive and Negative Forces, is seen as matter and antimatter. 

In Modern Physics, this is called negative and positive charge respectively 
- The male charge represents a particle having an inherent positive (anticlockwise) rotation   
- The female charge represents a particle having an inherent negative (clockwise) rotation


Layer | Positive Vortex | Negative Vortex
---- | --- | ---
Aethereal | Unifying |  Divisive
Spatial | Counterclockwise | Clockwise
Radiant | Male | Female
Convertible | Left | Right 
Material | Color Charge (Matter) | Anti-Color Charge (Antimatter)


Matter has a normal vortex rotation and Antimatter has a reverse vortex rotation. 
- These cancel the rotation of each other upon contant in space-time.
- This then forces their internal energy (as the locked up radiant energy) to go out back into space-time.
