Quantum Chromo Dynamics explains the Strong Force which has 3 properties:

1. Mass Gap
2. Quark Confinment
3. Chiral Symmetry Breaking 


### Mass Gap

The nature-based difference between `mass` and `potential` leads to a mass gap. 


### Quark Confinement

Quarks do not exist alone because they are bound by Relationality.


### Chiral Symmetry Breaking

## Color Charges and Mesons


{{< youtube 0jVMiF4nKoA >}}

Physics believes that quarks are held by gluons which have 3 color charges. 

Descartes refutes this by saying that matter is not bound by any glue. Instead, they are bound by perfect stillness.

Non-stillness is caused by kinetic spacetime particles called the 2nd Element. 

To create stillness, we create a different kind of spacetime particle called the aetherspace which is probabilistic instead of kinetic.

This is made up of 4 aether particles according to our Law of Conservation of the Aether. This law is derived from the 5 Elements model and particle shapes.  

A proton is created when an aetherspace particle is made still by 3 aetherspace.

This leads to 3 quarks and a non-free aether.

Radiant energy is made up of 3 aether particles.

The addition of energy disrupts this stillness. 

This frees the non-free aether. 

Creating 7 particles in the center. 

The free aether converts the energy particles into antiquarks. 

All spacetime is relational.

Relationality requires at least 2 identities. 

This is why a quark must always have a partner. 

This pair is called a meson.

Therefore, aetherspace particles remove the need for gluons and color charges.
