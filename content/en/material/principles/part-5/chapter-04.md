Protons are the substance of matter. They are:
- responsible for the persistence and solidity of objects
- made up of 3 quarks (qom)


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/klm.jpg" a="Proton" >}}

We change some names used in Physics in order to match Nature:

Physics Name | Material Superphysics Name
--- | ---
Atomic Number | Proton Number
Mass Number | Nucleon Number 
Atomic Mass (AMU) | Atomic Electromagnetic Potential 


## Solidity and Persistence

Physics believes that the solidity of matter is from the electromagnetic force simply because the electrons are the ones repeling each other. 

However, in Material Superphysics, the mechanism is the shells of the electron which are part of the proton's aetherspace. 

These shells are dictated by the proton just as the sun's orbits are dictated by the sun's vortex.

A denser object has more aetherspace and less space particles.

Fluids are bodies that are divided into many small particles, agitated by mutually different motions. Solids are bodies whose individual particles all remain at rest relative to each other.

## Quarks

Both protons and neutrons are made up of quarks which are the perceivable quanta of matter. 


### Avogadro's Number

Avogadro's Number is the number of molecules in a mole. This is then used to determine the mass of a molecule.
