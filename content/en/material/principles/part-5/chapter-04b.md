In Cartesian Physics, each of the elements is a mere version or modification of the aethereal substance. 


{{< q a="Descartes" >}}
Every other thing that can be attributed to body, presupposes extension [metaphysical space], and is only some mode of an extended thing [metaphysical object] just as all the properties we discover in the mind are only diverse modes of thinking.
{{< /q >}}

Therefore, each element is a version or 'mode' of hydrogen. So instead of 'elements', we call the unique combination of protons as versions of matter which we notate as v`atomic number`. For example:

Chemistry Name | Chemistry Symbol | Material Superphysics Symbol
--- | --- | ---
Sodium | Na | v11
Chlorine | Cl | v17

This leads to the following naming for compounds:

Chemistry Name | Chemistry Symbol | Material Superphysics Symbol
--- | --- | ---
Sodium Chloride | NaCl | `v11-v17` or `11-17` (eleven-seventeen)
Sodium Hydroxide | NaOH | `v11-v8-v1` or `11-8-1` (eleven-eight-one) 
Water | H2O | `v1(2)-v8` or `1(2)-8` "one-duo-eight" 


Sodium Hydroxide 1-18-1 dissolves in water 1(2)-8 to form:
- `11(♀)` 
- `8-1(♂)`


### The 5 Arms

These elements have 5 classifications called aether, air, fire, water, and earth. We connect this to the periodic table to create the Pentagonic Versions of Elements.

These start with hydrogen, incrementing alternately through the elements in a pentagon. This creates swrils, similar to a vortex, and is consistent with Cartesian vortices. 

This has advantages over the Periodic Table:

- It drops arbitrary names such as Einsteinium and Californium for numerical ones like "6" for carbon, so that CO2 is 6-8(2) pronounce six-eight-duo. In this way, people just need to memorize the atomic number. 
- The relationships of the compounds become more intuitive. For example, the magnetic metals form recurring rings, while the groups form spirals  



### The Weird Russel Table

The original version of the Periodic Table was created by Mendeleev in 1869. It had the hypothetical elements such as the ether and coronium. 

Artist Walter Russel created his own table with weird elements such as alphanon, betanon, and gammanon. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/russel.jpg" alt="Periodic Table of Russel" >}}


Russel's table is very arbitrary and inconsistent. However, it  had a vortex arrangement which allowed us to integrate Descartes' vortices with the material elements. 


{{< n n="Our priority was the Spatial Layer since that was the most lacking and misunderstood in the current sciences. We were supposed to look into the Periodic Table after going through the application of Cartesian Relationality in particle decay. However, someone sent us a video showing Terrence Howard talking about the Russell Table which was disgusting" >}}

<!-- We propose a Modified Periodic Tables of Elements that replaces the names of elements with their atomic numbers.

This is because Material Superphysics will open up new ways to create elements, leading to more elements. 

This will make the old system very inconvenient. -->


This table integrates the following principles:

1. The 5 Elements

This manifests as the 5 arms which leads to the 10 major element groups. It also explains why Carbon and Oxygen are so important in our living universe. 


2. The 2 Forces

This manifests as the sequence of the elements or versions spreading in an opposing pattern as the pentagon expands.

<!-- This has the following advantages:
- People don't need to memorize "Sodium", "Hydroxide", etc. Instead they just need to know the atomic numbers
- The relationships of the compounds become more intuitive. For example, the magentic metals form recurring rings, while the groups form spirals -->

The vortex pattern formed by the element-groups show the snapshot of the oversoul of the material layer in our universe. 

Other universes will have different patterns. 


<!-- In the future, we will add the following -->
