### The Conservation Laws

Each of the 5 Layers implements a Conservation Law in order to maintain the balance in the universe because:
- our universe is really one Supreme Entity, as a single unit
- a change in one aspect or part affects the whole  

This leads to 5 Conservation Laws, 1 for each Layer.

Layer | Conservation Law
--- | ---
Aethereal | Identity
Spatial | Momentum
Radiant | Energy 
Convertible | Aether 
Material | Mass

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/layers.png" a="Conservation Laws" >}}

Each law has its implementing rules which will be discussed in each Part for each layer. 


#### The Law of Conservation of Identity

This is the Material Superphysics version of the Law of Conservation of Idea of Superphysics.

This operates in the aethereal layer and is the foundation of the gravitational signature which this law says must be unique. 

This then leads to movement as those signatures adhere to this law in the physical domain.  


#### The Law of Conservation of Momentum 

This operates in the spatial layer and is the foundation of the rules of motion which are the implementing rules for this law.  


#### The Law of Conservation of Energy

This operates in the radiant layer and is already well known in Physics. Energy is the crudified version of momentum.

This actually changes the energy from electromagnetic to material motion. For example, a generator converts electromagnetic force into physical motions. 


#### The Law of Conservation of Aether

This operates in the convertible layer which facilitates "flavor changing" and is responsible for the diversity of the material layer below it. 

Flavor changing is a good and natural word for this layer because traditionally this was called the Water Element. 

It is the wetness of water and liquids that allows both:
- the perception of tastes by our tongue
- the detection of neutrinos by large liquid detectors.


#### The Law of Conservation of Mass

This operates in the material layer and is already well known in Physics. Matter is facilitated by the static aetherspace and is the most crudified version of the aether.
