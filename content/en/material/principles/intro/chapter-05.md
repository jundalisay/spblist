Superphysics sees ideas as static metaphysical objects that have a certain [geometry](/superphysics/principles/chapter-03e). This was what Euclid's Element was all about:


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/euclid.jpg" a="Euclid Postulates" >}}

Shallow people, of course, judge with their eyes and see that Euclid was explaining shapes and so they think his book was about shapes.

These 3 authors were writing about the 5 Elements:

1. Euclid
2. Kepler
3. Descartes

By combining their principles and merging them with those of Taoism and Hinduism, which learned of the 5 Elements earlier than the Europeans, we can create the following shapes for the particles in Material Superphysics.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/quantum.jpg" a="Shapes of Quantum Particles" >}}

{{< dc t="How We Got These" >}}
We derived these shapes after listing down:

1. The steps in our theory of how the Supreme creates reality in real time

This is the creation of particles of downgrade from idea to matter.

2. The effects of the Radiant layer particles namely the photon (light) and virtual photon (magnetism)  

This is how the particles interact. 

3. The steps of particle decay from collisions

This is the decay of particles or upgrade from matter back to the aether.

Some of these particles do not exist in Physics which only knows 3 of the 5 Elements.

This visualization will help us intuitively think of particle interactions.

For example, there is currently a mystery why there is a discrepancy between the predicted mass of the W boson and the actual measured mass. 

Our shapes system gives a clue that the culprit is in the neutrinos. This is because in our classification, neutrinos are in the same Layer as the W Boson, but have a flat shape.


### How it Works


The Euclidean Postulates can be suummed up in a few words:

1. Point to Point

We interpret this as the aether particle.

2. Infinite Line

We interpret this as the finite aetherspace that can extend indefintely.

3. Circle

We interpret this as the "round" action of photons which are shaped as circle in a line.

4. Right Angles

We interpret this as the left and right handed spin of the Weak Interaction

5. Meeting at a Point

We interpret this as the triangle created by gluon flux tubes (3 aetherspace particles). 



Each quantum particle is made up aether particles which can either be:
- round
- flat


{{< q a="Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia, Part 3, Article 87" >}}
They are small columns, hollowed out with 3 spirals like screw-threads. This lets them pass through those narrow passages while twisting
{{< /q >}}


These particles can be arranged in 2 ways:
- as a plane structure
- as a column structure


Force particles are generally tall because this gives them power to bore through other particles. 

Matter particles are generally shaped into a plane so that they can receive the force particles. 


Physics Name | Superphysics Version
--- | ---
Magnetic Moment | Size of Hole of Charged (or Gendered) Particle
Charge | Rotation Direction
Male Charge | Rotating Positively or Anticlockwise
Female Charge | Rotating Negatively or Clockwise
Spin | Orientation to Virtual Photon (means particle has thickness). A + spin means 
Electromagnetic Mass | Size (or Thickness?) of Hole to use Virtual Photons
Material Mass | Aetherspace Strength
