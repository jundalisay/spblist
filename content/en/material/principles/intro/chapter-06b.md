The Law of Conservation of Idea in Physical Reality  | This manifests as Gravitational Signatures
{{< /dc >}} -->


Chapter 4 explained that energy and force comes from the media of the 5 layers that transfer to the substances or particles in existence. 

The amount of energy that can course through the susbtance depends on the inherent configuration of that substance. We call this the gravitational signature, notated as `G`.

{{< img src="/graphics/super/egl.jpg" alt="E = Gl" >}}

Historically, this has been called:
- dharma (for general things)
- svadharma (for specific things)

It defines how things interact, not only with media and forces, but also with other substances and particles, and the rest of existence. 

  <!-- or how the forces flow through them.   -->

The gravitational signature also explains the purpose or use of a substance or thing in Nature, working within the conservation laws.

The more of the 5 Layers an object exists in, the more complex its signature. 

For example, each existing thing has the following components for its gravitational signature.

Layer | Location
--- | ---
Aethereal | Relative Purpose in Nature
Spatial | Spacetime coordinates
Radiant | Energy level
Convertible | Ability for chemical reactions 
Material | Persistence



<!-- The Law of Conservation of Idea of Superphysics states that everything in reality is an idea of the Supreme. 

All such ideas:
- pre-exist
- cannot be created nor destroyed, and
- are unique.

This uniqueness means that each idea has its own properties as imbued by its Creator.

These inherent properties are called its dharma or true nature. The inherent property of a unique idea or object is called *svadharma*.

These ideas get deployed in the physical domain where they manifest as identities. For example:
- a leaf is a separate identity from its tree
- a rock is a separate identity from its mountain
- a son is a separate identity from its parents and family  

Each identity is unique. In Physics, this uniqeuness manifests as:
- The Pauli Exclusion Principle for material particles
- The fact that you do not go 'through' your chair and occupy the same space that it does 

This uniqueness is denoted in reality by a metaphysical signature which determines:

1. What Layer or physical body it exists as
2. What potential motions it can do 

Since motion is more striking to the mind, we call these as gravitational signatures or `G`. Each `G` when deployed in physical reality is known as the **monad** or qoa1. -->


<!-- interaction between these identities creates movement  -->


### The Gravitational Signature Determines What Layer the Identity Exists In

Since the universe is made up of waves and each wave is a representative of a layer or element, then the properties of that identity will reveal either:
- the layer (subscript `l`) that it is in. This in turn will help reveal its gravitational signature `G` 
- its gravitational signature `G`. This will help reveal what layer it is in*

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/sub.jpg" alt="Sublayers" c="The material waves are most obvious to humans which are also made up of material bodies" >}}


<!-- The resulting energy can be used to reveal the G just as the G can be used to reveal the potential energy of the identity. 

This `G` is the "gravitational signature" and is really supposed to be `D` as dharma or `T` as tao or True Nature of Socrates. But that would turn away Westerners who have a distaste for non-Western ideas (which is a no-no if we are to unify the human species and put everyone, East and West, 'on the same page'). 

So we can stick with `G` as invented by the British Newton. 
- Like Newton, Socrates would think that this `G` is inherent to the body as what "objects carry in them"
- But unlike Newton who believed that `G` came from a material mass, the Socratic `G` comes from a metaphysical "true nature" which the Hindus call Dharma. 

In this way, the Socratic `G` still ends up as `D` if the thinking person chases it down. You could even say that `G` is the metaphysical DNA of everything in existence that dictates what movements it can do, and actually manifests as the DNA in physical living cells.

<!-- ### The Gravitational Signature is the Foundation of an Identity's Nature or its Motion


Aside from determining the Layer, a gravitational signature also determines the range of motions that arise from the attraction or repulsion by its affinity or difference with the other signatures, whether they are from objects, entities, or minds within the same layer.

Lower layers are affected by higher layers, but higher layers are unaffected by the lower. For example, light is affected by gravity, but gravity is not affected by light.


Layer | Motion Carriers (media)
--- | ---
Aethereal | Monad
Spacetime | Timespace
Radiant | Virtual Photons
Convertible | W Bosons 
 -->

<!-- Layer | Positive or Attraction | Negative or Repulsion 
--- | --- | ---
Aethereal | Attraction of related ideas and minds | Replusion of opposing ones
Spatial | Attraction to massive objects (vortices) | Repulsion to immaterial objects (non-vortices)
Radiant | Attraction of opposite charges | Repulsion of like charges
Convertible | Noninteraction that leads to nondecay | Interaction that decays the particle
Material | Gluons that form matter | Particle collisions that destroy that matter and convert them to spacetime) -->
 <!-- through the Law of Conservation of Idea -->



<!-- Knowing the `G` and the layer can also reveal what kind of particle it is. For example, the antimatter are created by the free aether aiming to upgrade matter.

Layer | Antiparticle
--- | ---
Radiant | positron :: -a(r)
Convertible | antineutrino :: -a(c)
Material | antihydrogen :: -a(H)

In theory, this means that peace and harmony can be achieved granularly by knowing the Gravitational signatures of everyone in order to reduce the repulsion of minds, and generally by imposing higher-layer ideas like virtue (this virtue-based socio-political system is then the job of Social Superphysics)" >}} -->

## Leads to Technologies 

In Material Superphysics, gravitational signatures lead to technology-solutions, just as they lead to social solutions in Social Superphysics and medical solutions in Bio Superhysics:

- Fusion is solved by knowing the gravitational signature of hydrogen
- Levitation is solved by knowing the gravitational signature of the object
- Teleportation is solved by estimating the gravitational signature of the object at the other location 
- Time travel is solved by the same estimation but with the additional factor of the object's past. This is why time travel to the past will be easier than a travel to the future.
