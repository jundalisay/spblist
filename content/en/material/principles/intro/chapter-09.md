The rules of motion in Chapter 6 emphasized that all motion is relative to, and requires, other bodies. 

{{< q a="Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia, Part 4 Article 202" >}} 
Gravity is a quality that depends on the relations of situation and motion of several bodies on each other.
{{< /q >}}


This idea is also embodied in Poincare's Law of Relativity:

{{< q a="Poincare" c="Science and Hypothesis, Chapter 5" >}}
The **state of bodies**, **their mutual distances**, and **the velocities with which those distances are changing** at that moment, will depend only on the state of those bodies, on their mutual distances and on the velocities with which those distances were changing at the initial moment.
{{< /q >}}

This has 3 components:

1. The Identities in the phenomenon

This is where particle shapes, mass, or other inherent quality comes in. 

2. The Nature of the Layer or Element of those Identities

This is the properties and differences of the 5 Layers

3. The Relationship between those identities and the layers

This is usually embodied by the spacetime between the identities. This includes speed, motion, location, etc. 

<!-- This is based on 2 spacetimes that are glued together by a relation created by the observing mind.   -->

The differences between gravitational signatures create movement between identities as either:
- attraction
- repulsion
- stasis

<!-- The addition or splitting of signatures is from the Negative Force, while the resulting stability is from the Positive. 

It follows that the energy or driving force is from the Positive and Negative Forces that exert themselves through the gravitational signature. -->

This potential energy of an identity for change or movement is estimated by the Eagle, which is our equation for everything:

{{< img src="/graphics/super/egl.jpg" alt="E = Gl" >}}

Cartesian Relationality and Poincare's Law of Relativity both are therefore implementations of our "eagle" of `E::Gl`.


In active form, the signatures form a chain for energies that affect the movement and change of others. These movements happen in the 'Cartesian View' which are slices of spacetime.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/urel.png" alt="The Eagle in Active Form" >}}

This chain is made up of ratios between the signatures of identities, and is processed by Qualimath.
- The chain is how everything in the universe is connected.
- These ratios are the relational bands between signatures. 


## Everything is in Motion

The creation of innumerable qost-identities leads to the expansion of the universe. These identities push each other to preserve their identity. This preservation is caused by [the Law of Conservation of Idea,](/superphysics/principles/chapter-03) a concept not present in Physics nor Science.

This pushing is based on the existential principle to preserve the discreteness of identity. This principle* then leads to:
- the law of conservation of energy in the Radiant Layer
- the law of conservation of mass in the Material Layer


The main difference between our unification and the one done by Einstein is that Einstein uses light or Electromagnetism as the unifying medium, whereas we use the aether. 


<!-- The pushing leads to the creation and expansion of physical space, first as 2-dimensional (Pythagorean duad) and then into 3-dimensions (triad). The sequence of expansion then leads to physical time as the fourth dimension (tetrad), leading to 4-dimensional "Minkowski" spacetime to an observer. -->

<!-- This "pushing" is similar to the theory of Descartes which was destroyed by Newton:

q a="Adam-Smith" c="The History of Astronomy by Adam Smith Simplified" >}}
According to Descartes, through an eternal revolution from rest to motion and motion to rest, the amount of motion in the universe was always the same. But there was no void. 

No part of matter could be moved without thrusting some other out of its place. The matter which any body pushed before it, rolled immediately backwards, to supply the place of that matter which flowed in behind it. 

This is similar to the swimming of a fish. The water, which it pushes before it, immediately rolls backwards, to supply the place of what flows in. It thus forms a vortex around the body of the fish. In the same way, the motion originally impressed by the Creator on matter produced in it an infinity of vortices, or circular streams. 
/q >}}


The range of motions arising from the perpetual pushing is determined by the identity's gravitational signature in relation to other signatures. The relation can be within the same Layer or extend to lower Layers. For example, magnetism is affected by heat, but not by light, just as light is affected by gravity, but gravity or weight is not changed by light.  -->

Spatial | E::G(vortex)

<!-- Can't find a [WIMP of dark energy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/02/22/the-wimp-miracle-is-dead-as-dark-matter-experiments-come-up-empty-again/#95053e86dbc6)? That's because space isn't a thing that fills gaps between objects. Rather, it's just an effect of observation and is the same reason behind quantum non-locality.

Space-time depends totally on perception. Rather than say that it is infinite, it is more correct to call it as totally abitrary. A particle, when imposed on (since its 'spin' reflects reality), can therefore arbitrarily change its location and 'defy' gravity and locality.

<!-- <p>It can be detected indirectly by electromagentism. For example, LIGO uses lasers to detect gravitational waves.</p> -->

<!-- However, this detection is partly sophistical because it imposes the properties of electromagentism onto the properties of spacetime. A person interpreting LIGO data will interpret gravitational waves to travel at the speed of light simply because light was used to measure it.</p>
 -->

<!-- Creation goes on to make the 5th, 6th, and 7th dimensions*. However, only the 4 dimensions are visible to our ordinary senses, since the 5th to 7th are metaphysical in essence. 

> *The 7 dimensions match the 7 chakra-vortices in Hinduism and is essential in Ayurveda, which we classify under [Bio Superphysics](/bio). The sequence of creation is actually in reverse. From the Creator's perspective, it starts from the 7th then goes down to the 1st dimension. But from our perspective as 'createes', it's from the 1st to the 7th.  

Thus, spacetime is created by the mere existence or popping-in of the qosts from the aether. This gives the **illusion** of movement by one qost against the other when in fact, none of them are moving. The only real movement is their appearance into reality or actuality coming from nonreality or probability.
