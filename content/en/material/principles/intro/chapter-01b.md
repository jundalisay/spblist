Material Superphysics is based on the Superphysics principle that:
- reality is split between the physical and metaphysical domains
- the metaphysical is supeior rot he physical i.e. the physical is the effect of the metaphysical

In Particle Superphysics, we say that particles become points when they are deployed onto reality.
- But they are shapes while in abstraction.

An analogy is programming language. 

Java is readable by humans. But it must be converted into bytecode to be readable by the computer. 

So the shapes and vortices that we describe for particles are for human undstanding so that humans can harness Nature by manipulating those shapes and vortices.
- But they convert into waves and points in Nature.

Quantum mechanics observes points and waves and so they make non-intuitive and complicated conclusions, as a science based on wave functions. 

This is because the Newtonian or mathematical system of theorizing puts central basis on the data and then bends human understanding to match that data (as materialist interpretations). 

This leads to confusing, arbitrary principles that are discarded whenever new data comes in.       

In the programming analogy, this is like a human who weirdly acts like a computer, losing the creative advantages of being human.

In contrast, the Cartesian system deconstructs empirical observations and converts them to human abstractions. 

This creates a set of coherent principles similar to a source code is coherent with itself.

These principles are then tested in the real world to prove the coherence of the understanding by humans on the phenomena in question. 


## Active and Passive Detection

A major shortcoming of quantum mechanics is that it uses passive detection of waves because it doesn't know active detection. 

For example, MicroBooNE and AMANDA passively detect the oncoming neutrinos that go through scintillators and ice.
- This limits its data compared to had it known active detection. 

We also call this active detectoin as probing. This was used by Socrates as a questioning method to reveal the mental pattern of the person he was talking to.  

So we can say that active detection on particles is particle dialetics. This is done by imposing the aether, since it is the superior layer.
