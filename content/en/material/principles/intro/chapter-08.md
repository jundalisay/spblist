The 2 Forces in Physical Reality | This manifests as polarities in the 5 Layers
{{< /dc >}}


The 4th Rule of Cartesian Motion is about the presence of absence of vortices. 

This allows us an easier way to classify the polarities in phenomena so that all phenomena happen:

1. Independently

This is when the identity is alone. This leads to vortex-less phenoemena. This is Negative.

2. Dependently

This is when the identity is not alone. This leads to vortex phenoemena. This is Positive.


The Positive and Negative then express themselves differently when there is a vortex or no vortex.


Layer | Positive | Negative
--- | --- | ---
Probability | Existing | Non-Existing
Aethereal Vortex | Dharmic | Adharmic
Aethereal Vortexless | Dynamic | Static 
Spatial Vortex |  Anticlockwise Rotation | Clockwise Rotation
Spatial Vortexless | High Pressure | Low Pressure
Radiant Vortex | Male Charge | Female Charge
Radiant Vortexless | Particle Spin 1/2 | Particle Spin 1 or 0 
Convertible Vortex | Left-Handed | Right-Handed
Convertible Vortexless | Reaction | Non-Reaction
Material Vortex | Matter | Antimatter
Material Vortexless | Gas | Solid

In the Probability Layer, this manifests as the possibility of being perceived or non-being perceived.

<!-- > e.g. "Unicorns do not exist. Horses do." -->


In the Aethereal Layer, this manifests as:
- creative or destructive.
- energetic or non-energetic.

<!-- > e.g. "Evolution speeds up the more aether that you have." -->


In the Spatial Layer, this manifests as:
- clockwise supermassive blackholes called quasars and anticlockwise ones as galaxies
- gravity and lack of gravity

<!-- > e.g. "A quasar is brighter than a galaxy" -->


In the Radiant Layer, this manifests as:
- a male charge for the positive charge in Physics, and female charge for the negative charge
- particle spin 0 and 1, versus 1/2, 3/2, 5/2


<!-- > e.g. "Like charges (male and male, female and female) repel." -->


In the Convertible Layer, this manifests as:
- left- and right-handed helicity
- reaction and non-reaction

<!-- . This is required in 'weak' interaction or flavor changing which we call conversion. 

> e.g. "All neutrinos are left-handed and undergo flavor changing." -->


In the Material Layer, this manifests as:
- matter versus antimatter
- solids versus gases

<!--  color charge and anti-color charge. This is required for antimatter. 

> e.g. "Matter is annihilated when it meets antimatter." -->


The details of each duality will be explained in each Part.
