Each layer has a specific set of actions that are different from those of other layers. 

This can be seen as their division of labor in creating reality. 

Action is the opposite of perception, just as output is the opposite of input. 
- Action is expression
- Perception is absorption

{{< q a="Descartes" c="Philosophy, Part 1, Article 26" >}}
There are only 2 modes of thinking in us: the perception of the understanding and the action of the will

Convertible | change, instability
Material | stability, contraction
