There are 5 Layers in Reality | Each Layer has a sound
{{< /dc >}}


{{< youtube QzftMDjhV6M >}}



The universe is a reality that is made up of waves that can be neatly integrated and categorized into 5 Layers.

An analogy is a Photoshop image which is made up layers that are on top of each other. 

{{< img src="/graphics/super/layers.jpg" alt="Layers in an image" cap="Reality is made up of 5 Layers which the ancients called the 5 Elements" >}}

These layers were known to the ancient Greeks, Hindus, and Chinese as the *5 Elements*. Currently, Modern Physics only knows 3 of the 5 as:

1. Strong Force
2. Weak Force 
3. Electromagnetism 

The 4th force as gravity is not yet fully understood by Modern Physics. To understand why, we have to look into the nature of Western thinking.

 <!-- Such a concept is absent in science because science came from the Western civilization which is really just the Roman Empire.  -->


## Mathematics and Matter: The Western Limitations

Modern Physics came from Isaac Newton who came up with classical mechanics to explain why 17th-century things move. For example, a falling apple immediately includes 3 of the 5 forces:

1. Strong force to keep the apple's identity and not go through the earth*
2. Gravitational force to make the apple fall
3. Electromagnetism for the apple to be seen  

{{< n n="In Material Superphysics, contact forces are facilitated by the same mechanism as the Strong Force which we call aetherspace particles" >}}

<!-- > *Newton's Principia is written in Latin, the language of the Roman Empire -->

Newton was very good at math and so he naturally had little knowledge of metaphysics. This is because math deals with counting discrete identities and particles such as `1`, `2`, `3` whereas metaphysics deals with abstract waves such as the feelings of `peace`, `prosperity`, and `love`.


Notice how, when thinking about `1`, `2`, `3`:
- your awareness goes to your brain
- your thinking becomes very granular, precise, and small.

Whereas, when you think about `peace`, `prosperity`, and `love`:
- your awareness shifts to your heart, or at least away from your brain and onto the outside world.
- your thinking becomes wider, less precise, and large.  

This is why Socrates said that the mathematician cannot possibly discover how the greater universe works. Rather, it is the dialectician who can.  

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Surely the skilled mathematician is not a dialectician. (The Republic by Plato Simplified, Book 7)
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
Surely no, I do not know any mathematician capable of reasoning.
{{< /r >}}



This is consistent with great sages being bad at math:

{{< q a="M" c="The Gospel of Ramakrishna" >}}
Sri Ramakrishna's greatest delight was to listen to stories from Hindu mythology and the epics. These he would
afterwards recount from memory, to the great joy of the villagers. He enjoyed painting. **But arithmetic was his great aversion.**
{{< /q >}}

<!-- This is why Newton kept on studying the Bible and making predictions from it, as if they could ever come true. His  -->

Newton's ignorance of metaphysics is why he could not find the cause of gravity.

{{< q a="Hume" c="Treastise of Human Nature" >}}
The Newtonian philosophy asserts that the real nature of space is unknown.
{{< /q >}}

Without the ability to 'feel for the universe', Newton has no choice but to use the "shut up and calculate" way of reasoning. 

{{< q a="Newton" c="Principia Mathematica Book 3, General Scholium" >}}
But I have not been able to discover the cause of gravity from phenomena. I have no hypotheses because hypotheses have no place in experimental philosophy.. To me, it is enough that gravity exists and that it accounts for all the motions of the the celestial bodies, and of our sea. 
{{< /q >}}

  <!-- go But it is most obvious in his attempts to find hidden codes or prophecies in the Bible.  -->

The knowledge of metaphysics can be revealed by knowing the nature of the **aether** just as that of physics can be known by revealing the nature of **matter**. 
- The aether acts as waves
  - This is good for music and therefore art and philosophy
- Matter acts as particles
  - This is good for quantifying and therefore math and engineering

The operations of the mind for math and for philosophy are very different. 
- Philosophy requires both heart and brain
- Math requires brain only, as proven by calculators that have zero heart

<!-- - A good philosopher often is bad at math
- An excellent mathematician is often awful at philosophy -->

In fact, it is common to hear about mathematicians theorizing about paradoxes involving infinitity. This is merely a waste of time and mental energy. 

<!-- Superphysicists (SPs or 'espees') are generally philosophers first, who use data science and computers to augment any deficiency in mathematics or memorization. Rather than memorize formulas, SPs should understand how the formulas work, so they can recreate or derive formulas on-the-fly. Such a pardigm is embodied in our 'Qualimath'. -->



## The Evolution of Physics from the Focus on Matter

<!-- We can say that the dark ages are still in force. The bright spots were the Roman Empire Stoicism and the Enlightenment. Asia is also in its own dark ages, with the birght pots during the Buddhist and Taoist persiods and the the latter as Song Dynasty and   -->

Using math, Modern Physics began with a matter-first paradigm because matter is easily countable and plottable. In fact, Newton began Physics using moon observations since the moon is easily seen. 

Physics then jumped to the realm of electromagnetism when moving currents were discovered (as opposed to static electricity). 

Over time, physicists classified forces into four:

1. Strong
2. Weak
3. Electromagnetism
4. Gravitation

Physicists are still mystified by gravity, as proven by the lack of anti-gravity technology.
 <!-- which has very different dynamics from Matter or Electromagnetism.  -->

Einstein's General Relativity (GR) was supposed to explain it. Like Newton, Einstein was good at math and also chose to base his principles on the obvious. In this case, Einstein chose to base time on light when in reality, time should be based on psychology. 

We call this the [Einstein trap or the Relativity scam](/material/fallacies/scam).

<!-- This has led to his [field equations being unsolvable](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/12/04/this-is-why-scientists-will-never-exactly-solve-general-relativity/). -->


## The Asian Model

Material Superphysics breaks through the limitations of Modern Physics by using the proper metaphysics from the ancient Greeks, Indians, and Chinese who all follow a 5-Element model: 

Greeks (Timaeus) | Hindus | Chinese | Greek Shape | Superphysics Shape
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
Aether (dodecahedron) | Akasha | 水 still water | Dodecahedron ![Dodecahedron](/graphics/physics/dode.gif) | Pentagon
Wind (octahedron) | Vayu | 木 moving wood | Octahedron ![Octahedron](/graphics/physics/octa.gif) | Square
Fire (tetrahedron) | Tejas | 火 radiant fire | Tetrahedron ![Tetrahedron](/graphics/physics/tetra.gif) | Line
Water (icosahedron) | Jala | 土 transforming earth | Icosahedron ![Icosahedron](/graphics/physics/icos.gif) | Dash
Earth (cube) | Pritvi | 金 solid metal | Cube ![Cube](/graphics/physics/cube.gif) | Dot



## Superphysics Uses Layers Instead of Fields, Data Models Instead of Equations

Physicists think in 'fields' as a consequence of Faraday assigning '[lines of force](/research/whittaker/aether/chapter-06)' to electromagnetic phenomena. 

But this is refuted by Timeaus who wrote that circular motion is the default motion, as a consequence of having no void. 

{{< q a="Timaeus" >}}
The universe was made to move in the same way and on the same spot, within his own limits revolving in a circle. All the other 6 motions were taken away from it. As this circular movement required no feet, the universe was created without legs and without feet.
{{< /q >}}

This was later developed by Descartes in his theory of vortices. This is why we use layers (and slices) instead of fields.

The top layer, aether, always changes and so we use data models that have conditionals.  

We then unify all the understandings of the Romans, Greeks, Hindus, and Chinese under our 5-Layer model:

Name | Greek-Hindu-Chinese | Physics | Superphysics
--- | --- | --- | --- 
Probability | Metaphysical | Probability | Probability
Aethereal | Aether, Akasha, 水 (still water) | Pseudo-science | Mind 
Spatial | Air, Vayu, 木 (moving wood) | Gravity, Dark Matter, Dark Energy | Space
Radiant | Fire, Tejas, 火 (expanding fire) | Electromagnetism | Radiance
Convertible | Water, Jala, 土 (changing earth) | Weak | Conversion 
Material | Earth, Pritvi, 金 (solid metal) | Strong | Aetherspace

<!-- Rank | Name | Greek-Hindu | Chinese | Physics Force | Superphysics Force | Force Carrier | Resulting particles in Superphysics | Pythagorean Note

These 5 layers classify Physical Reality neatly so that it can integrate perfectly with Metaphysical Reality which is made up of life, soul and identity. 

<!-- mysteries of quantum physics (which is based on the radiant or electromagnetic layer) by extending human knowledge onto the higher gravitational (spatial) and aethereal layers.  -->


{{< q a="Krishna" c="Bhagavad Gita" >}}
My manifest form is made up of:
1. Earth
2. Water
3. Flame
4. Air
5. Aether
6. Life
7. Mind (Soul)
8. Individuality (Identity)

These are my lower Nature. Learn my higher Nature that produces this Universe by its principle of life.

These layers are immediately implementable in healthcare. For example:
- Ayurveda has the 3 doshas (3 of the 5 layers)
- Traditional Chinese medicine has wu xing (all 5 layers). 

Western medicine only works on the material layer which is the crudest of the five. This explains why Western medicine has no solution to mental problems such as ADHD, bipolar disorder, addiction, mass shootings, and terrorism*. These reside in the the aethereal and spatial layers, not in the material layer.

{{< n n="*This is why physically bombing the terrorists does not really solve terrorism. It merely causes it to retreat to terrorize another day." >}}
  

Western medicine is very good at material health problems that can be cured by physical surgery or masked by chemical medicines.
