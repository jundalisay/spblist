There are 5 Layers in Reality | Each Layer has 3 Sublayers Representing 3 Influences 
{{< /dc >}}


Chapter 1 explained that the universe is made up of waves categorized into 5 layers. 

Each wave moves up and down, as a result of the belligerence of the Positive and Negative Forces, from its zero level.

We call this zero or average level as the **central signature or dharma** for that wave.

This means that a wave has 3 kinds depending on its relation to that central signature. It can be:
- above that level -- we call this the subtlifying influence (sattvaguna)
- within that level -- we call this the transformative influence (rajoguna)
- below that level -- we call this the crudifying influence (tamoguna)

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/sub.jpg" alt="Sublayers" c="The material waves are most obvious to humans which are also made up of material bodies" >}}

These [3 influences](/superphysics/principles/chapter-06b/) produce the 3 sublayers:
- upper
- middle
- lower


For example, the Material layer will have 3 sublayers with each with its own force or media, and quantum:

Layer | Sublayer | Medium | Quantum
--- | --- | --- | ---
Aethereal | Upper | mom1 (gas, bose condensate) | qom1 (Up-Down Quarks)
. | Middle | mom2 (liquid) |  qom2 (Strange-Down Quark)
. | Lower | mom3 (solid) | qom3 (Top-Bottom Quark)

## The Internal Boundary

Within the sublayers is an internal boundary that separates the upper from the middle and lower sublayers. 

- Above the boundary, the sublayer has more quasi-physical than physical properties. 
- Below the boundary, the sublayer has more physical ones. 

For example, a well known boundary is the Higgs Field which we regard as the internal boundary within the Radiant Layer.

- Below the Higgs Field, particles acquire measurable **potential energy**, called mass in Modern Physics, in Million electron Volts or MeV.  
- Above the Higgs Field, particles such as photons and 'gravitons' have no mass. This is because particles above the boundary are kinetic instead of potential. 


This gives us 5 Boundaries:

Layer | Boundary | Description
--- | --- | ---
Aethereal | aib (Aethereal Internal Boundary) | Separates aethereal identities that can be split up
Spatial | sib (Spatial Internal Boundary) | Separates space from time 
Radiant | rib (Radiant Internal Boundary) | Separates identities with potential energy
Convertible | cib (Convertible Internal Boundary) | Separates identities that can be changed 
Material | mib (Material Internal Boundary) | Separates material and not-so-material identities

<!-- identities with can be further split up (manifesting as splitting up)  that can be split up by antimatter -->
<!-- 
Energy and the 2 Forces manifest via Media differently in the 5 layers and each of the sublayers.

Sublayer | Quantum | Media | 2 Forces
--- | --- | --- | ---
Upper Aethereal | Mind  | Sound | Existence or Nonexistence
Middle Aethereal | Qoa (Idea) | Sound | Consonance or Dissonance
Lower Aethereal | Thought | Sound | Consonance or Dissonance
Upper Spatial | Metaphysical Spacetime (Multiverses) |  |  
Middle Spatial | Galactic Qost | Universe | Fast or slow
Lower Spatial | Qost | Space and time within a universe | Gravity or Anti-gravity
Upper Radiant | Muon | Mor1 (Infrared) | Bright or Dark
Middle Radiant | Electron | Mor2 (Visible Light) | Energetic or non-energetic
Lower Radiant | Tau | Mor3 (UV Light) | Magnetic or Nonmagnetic
Upper Convertible | Z Boson |  |  
Middle Convertible | W- Boson | Radioactivity | Persistence or Decay
Lower Convertible | W+ Boson |  | 
Upper Material | Up Quark | Gas | Persistence | Blue Charge
Middle Material | Down Quark | Liquid | Persistence | Green Charge
Lower Material | Strange Quark | Solid | Persistence | Red Charge
 -->

<!-- Layer | Energy | Manifestation
--- | --- | ---
Upper Aethereal | Strength of idea or feeling | 
Lower Aethereal | Strength of idea or feeling | Sound
Upper Spatial | Strength of a vortex (black hole) | Gravity
Lower Spatial | Strength of a vortex (black hole) | Gravity
Upper Radiant | Energy in a photon or electron | Heat and Light
Lower Radiant | Energy in a photon or electron | Heat and Light
Upper Convertible | Energy in a W Z boson | Stability
Convertible | Energy in a W Z boson | Stability
Material | Energy in an atomic nucleus | Identity -->


## The Hierarchy of the Layers

From the Medium-Substance-Quantum (MSQ) Table in Chapter 3, we can deduce that everything in existence has varying degrees of the following qualities:

Layer | Quality
--- | --- 
Aethereal | Audibility or Harmony 
Spatial | Size
Radiant | Visibility
Convertible | Stability
Material | Identifiability


The layers work in a hierarchy.
- The aether is the most superior and subtle
- Matter is the most inferior and crude. 

This hierarchy explains why gravity affects light and heat, but light and heat does not affect gravity. 

For example, adding heat to a rock will not make it float. Shining light on a rock will reveal its identity, but not make it heavier or lighter.

<!-- In Social Superphysics, this is why those who know the 5 Layers (or 5 Elements) tend to be non-democratic. This is because, in order to full utilize or maximize the benefits of Nature's hierarchy, wild democracy has to be stamped out. This increases the chances for 'Golden Ages' in a civilization.

In Bio Superphysics, this hierarchy principle manifests as Homeopathy or Chinese medicine having less bad side effects than Western Medicine.  -->


### Cleaning Up The Sciences

Science was created by the Europeans who built knowledge from the bottom material layer -- the most inferior but most obvious one. 

From the bottom, they worked their way up:

Layer | European Discovery
--- | ---
Matter | Contact Forces, Monetary Systems
Convertible | Chemistry and Nuclear Reactions
Radiant | Electricity, International Finance


This led to a messy, fragmented, and non-intuitive system of knowledge. For example:
- Physics is now split into Particle Physics and Quantum Physics
- Medicine is split into Western Medicine and Alternative Medicine 
- Economics is split into Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Behavioral Economics, Welfare Economics, etc. 

We clean up this mess by:
- putting all knowledge into the 5 Layers, and
- adding the 2 Forces as its operators.

These then create everything in reality.



## Organization of the 5 Layers in This Work

The principles of Material Superphysics is organized under the following headings which become Chapters.
