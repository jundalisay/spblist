### Overhauling the Particles

<!-- Hadrons, Baryons, Mesons, Leptons, Fermions, and Bosons -->

The most confusing thing about modern Physics is the messy classification of particles into Hadrons, Baryons, Mesons, Leptons, Fermions, and Bosons. 

This was because in the past, particles were much simpler, as being electrons, neutrons or protons. 

The problem began when physicists started smashing atoms, leading to subatomic particles which then had to be classified. 

They did not know the ancient Physics concept of the 5 Elements. 

Instead, they only knew Electromagnetism as the supreme principle, which is merely the 3rd Element in the ancient system of classification and the 1st Element in the Cartesian system.

'Spin' is the most obvious property of Electromagnetism and so they ended up classifying subatomic particles:
- based on spin (as fermions, bosons, and leptons) or
- based on quarks (as hadrons, baryons, mesons)

These classify an even messier naming convention of particles:
- Greek-based such as Proton, Electron, Tau
- Person such as Fermion, Boson, Higgs
- Silly such as Quark, Gluon, Up, Down, Charm, Strange  

We fix this to make their naming more intuitive and therefore easier to remember, by basing it on the ancient system as intended by Rene Descartes who was the author of Physics before Newton.  

This system divides everything in the universe as either a quantum-substance or a medium.
- The medium is where force works through. 
- The substance is the discrete identity that reacts to the force. 
- The quantum is the smallest unit of substance.

The Graviton, Electromagnetic, Weak, and Strong Forces are replaced with Spacetime, Radiance, Convertible, and Material Layers.

<!-- This is because all forces are really from the Aether ELement which manifests through Spacetime (i.e. gravity, magnetism, and contact forces make two things closer together in space). -->

Each Layer has a representative quantum-substance and a representative medium. 

For example:
- electrons represent the Radiant Element and is therefore renamed as "qor" or quantum of radiance
- light is the medium of Radiance and so photons are renamed into "mor" or medium of radiance
- neutrons represent the Convertible Element and becomes "qoc" 
- the W+, W- and Z bosons become "moc3", "moc2", and "moc1" respectively. 


The same convention is applied to all the other Layers. In this way, people only need to know the 5 layer names.




### Charges

Charges are denoted by male `♂` and female `♀` symbols. A neutral charge is hermaphroditic `⚥`.
- An electron (qor) has a male charge 
- A proton (som) has a female charge
- A neutron (soc) is hermaphroditic.

Physics | Superphysics
--- | ---
Negative `-` | Male `♂`
Positive `+` | Female `♀`
Neutral  | Neutral `⚥`


In this way, beta decay is denoted as:

```
soc → som + qor + -qoc1
```

Here, the convertible substance transforms into material, radiant, and anti-convertible quanta. 



### Antimatter

Antimatter is denoted with a negative sign in the front since the male symbol already denotes negative charge. This is different from Physics which is in a superscript.

Physics | Superphysics
--- | ---
Antimatter `-` | Antimatter `-`
Matter `+` | Matter `+`



## Overhauling The Chemical Elements

The future discovery of the aether will lead to the creation or discovery of many more chemical combinations. This would overwhelm the mind with so many new names. 

This is why we simplify the naming of chemical elements by reducing superfluous data.*

{{< n n="We did this with news articles via bullet-style writing, which is a kind of dimensionality reduction of data" >}}


We rename them into their atomic number representing their Version of Matter (to be discussed in the part on the Material Layer).
- Hydrogen is `1`
- Oxygen is `8`
- Water becomes `1(2)-8`
- Table salt is `11-17`

Name | Chemistry | Superphysics
--- | --- | ---
Hydrogen | H | 1 or "v1"
Water | H2O | 1(2)-8 or "1-duo-8"
