The constants in Nature are the fixed values that, to Superhysics, represent the ratios between the Layers.


### Spatial-Radiant

For example, a well-known constant is the speed of light (Radiant) which is the distance that it travels in 1 second (Spatial).

So the higher layer is the Spatial which is used to judge the Radiant, as light, as it moves in 1 unit of time. 


### Material-Spatial

1 second is based on a constant of oscillations of the Cesium atom (Material) when put under microwave radiation (Radiant). 

And so the Physics measure for the universe is based on the Material Layer. 




Constant | Value |  | Ratio Layers
--- | --- | --- | ---
Pi | 3.14.. | | Radiant-Spatial
Gravity | (6.6743 ± 0.00015) × 10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2 | | Material-Spatial
Speed of light | 299,792,458 | | Radiant-Spatial 
Fine Structure Constant | 0.00729927007 | | Radiant-Aetherspace
Second | 9,192,631,770 Hz | | Radiant-Material


<!-- Beam of Cesium Atoms:

    Cesium atoms are heated and passed through a vacuum chamber.

Microwave Field Exposure:

    The atoms are exposed to microwaves at different frequencies.

    If the frequency exactly matches the natural resonance of cesium, atoms will absorb energy and transition between energy states.

Detecting the Transition:

    A magnetic filter removes atoms that didn’t transition.

    A detector counts how many atoms changed states.

    The experiment is repeated at slightly different frequencies until the maximum transition is observed.

Finding the Exact Frequency:

    The frequency that causes the maximum transition is determined to be 9,192,631,770 Hz.

    This means one second is defined as the time it takes for cesium-133 to oscillate exactly 9,192,631,770 times. -->
