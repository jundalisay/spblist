<!-- Cartesian Wave-Particle Duality and Double-Slit --> 

The Radiant Layer is the middle of the 5 Layer or 5 Elements model. 
- The top layer is the aether which is made of waves
- The bottom layer is matter which is made of particles

Being in the middle gives the Radiant Layer the properties of both waves and particles. 
- The waves include photons (mor1) and virtual photons (mor2)
- The particles include electrons (qor) and heat (mor3)

This is why heat can be accurately measured in calories just as electricity can be measured in volts. These can persist. 

Light and magnetism on the other hand are measured in luminosity and force which vary a lot. 

In our MSQ model, the radiant internal boundary (rib) separates the wave part from the particle part. This is now known as the Higgs field.

## Cartesian Wave-Particle Duality, as Grapes

In 1632, Descartes wrote about the wave-particle duality of electromagnetism (which he called the 1st Element) by using the analogy of grapes and grape juice in a vat with 2 holes.

Imagine that the solar system is a vat filled with grape juice and crushed grapes. 


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/vat.jpg" a="Vat of grapes" >}}


The juice represents light and virtual photons which go in straight lines. The crushed grapes are the electromagnetic particles (electrons, muons, neutrinos, etc.).

The juice is propelled by energy (now called electromagnetic fields) and can be stopped by removing that energy. This has been proven by the Lene Hau experiment. 

Cutting 2 slits into the vat will make the juices flow out as waves in straight lines, but not the grapes. 

When the juice hits something, its trajectory will be deflected or bent.

The 2 slits are the eyes that are hit by the light, causing the light to refract and hit the retina to become data, as impressions on the "animal spirit" particles that are inside the nerves.

The data from the 2 eyes "interfere" with each other, and so the brain has to compensate and merge them in the visual cortex.

No matter what shape the parts of the eye may have, it is impossible for them to make the rays coming from different points assemble precisely at specific points.

Unfortunately, the brain can only work with the data sent by eyes. 

This allows optical illusions such as the grid illusion wherein the inaccuracy of the refraction by the retina causes the black squares to be put in the intersections of the grid. 

This causes gray shades to appear in varying intensities continuously, representimg the constant changes in the retina.

The data is also the basis for ideas and memory 


## Entanglement

Cartesian Physics not only unites Classical and Quantum Mechanics through its 5 Elements model, but also all sciences, even biology with data science (via neurons and neural neworks)

In Cartesian Physics, all light is "entangled" in Nature. This is revealed when they are split by prisms. 

These turn into particles whenever they hit anything, whether as sunlight shining on a ball, or a laser being split by a prism.
- We can call this as "particlization"
- "Wavization" therefore is the conversion of particles into waves, such as the Bose condensate

<!-- True motion or potential motion.  -->
