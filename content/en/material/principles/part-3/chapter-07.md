The territory of the Radiant Layer can be divided into micro and macro.

- The micro takes the form of electron shells within atoms
- The macro is the magnetic field of a channel or vortex 


### Electrons Shells: The Electron as a Satellite

An electron goes around the nucleon of an atom as a receiver of external force and emitter of the nucleon's qualities. 

This is similar to how a satellite interfaces between its main planet and other planets nearby. 

There are currently 5 orbits or shells: K, L, M, N, O

These have subshells based on the how many electrons they can hold: s, p, d, f, g.

### Magnetic Fields

The interaction of virtual photons and electrons create a magnetic field.
