The radiant layer is below the spatial layer. It is the energetic part of the universe, facilitating light and heat-energy, spreading them out, "radiating" them, in space at the speed limit of spacetime (known to physics as the speed of light). 

It manifests as light, heat, magnetism, and electricity. This is the most useful layer for humans because light furnishes information and colors for us to perceive the physical domain.

In terms of creation, this layer is the third layer that spreads across the space created by the spacetime layer.

### Definition and Properties of The Radiant Layer

The Radiant Layer facilitates information and kinetic energy within the spatial layer.

Unlike the aethereal and spatial layers which are purely kinetic, it is has partly kinetic and partly static parts. 
- The kinetic parts manifest as waves
- The tatic parts manifest as the non-media particles

Unlike the aethereal and spatial layers which are invisible, the entire radiant layer is detectable by instruments. The latest particle to be detected was the Higgs Boson.

Each particle in the Radiant Layer is made up of 3 aether particles. 
- Force and matter particles are not interchangeable 

This also follows the inverse square law, like the spatial layer. 

But because it is located at the center of the 5 layer model, it is the basis of gauge symmetries in materialist physics. Examples of gauge symmetries are:
- Yang Mills
- Maxwell Electromagnetism  
- Einstein's General Relativity


Magnetism takes place in the spatial layer just like gravity, but is facilitated by the radiant layer just as gravity is facilitated by the material layer.

This unifies magnetism with gravity, allowing Cartesian Relationality on both. 



Electromagnetism was already known from the time of William Gilbert in 1600. The main difference was that they proposed to derive it from amber and not from copper. This is why Descartes proposed to prove electromagnetism by creating friction from "amber, wax, resin, glass, and similar substances". His magnetic field shows electrons with particle spin as corkscrews. 

Descartes knew that lightning was electricity. His cause for lightning is the sudden shift of light and heavy air masses. This shift causes a spark just like rubbing causes static electricity.  

It's alarming how little people know about all of Physics. They only know from Newton to Einstein which is a very small part of history and the world. Yet somehow, people are proud of that smallness.
