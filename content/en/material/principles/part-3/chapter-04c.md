In Superphysics, we call electricity as electric-fluid in reference to the liquid nature of spacetime and the aether.

This is the main substance of radiance as it is responsible for many phenomena associated with the Radiant Layer.


### Coulomb's Law: Netwon's G in Radiance

Augustin de Coulomb first did experiments with electricity using a torsion balance in 1834. It showed that the magnetic force* between 2 charged spheres was affected by:
- the amount of charge in the spheres
- the distance between them 

{{< n n="We call it magnetic force under Cartesian Physics because our basis for magnetism is the virtual photon which only acts on male and female charges" >}}

This is consistent with the inverse square law for gravity and light:
- Gravity is the spread of displaced space particles
- Light is the spread of photons
- Magnetic attraction and repulsion is from the flow of virtual photons 

This is why we can regard Coulomb's Law as Netwon's `G` in the Radiant Layer.


### Conductors and Insulators

The main mechanism for electricity, magnetism, and light transparency require channels.
- Conductors are materials that have these channels
- Insulators are materials that do not have them

Electricity happens when there is a flow of eletrons from space that has many electrons (high volume) to a space that has few electrons. This is because the electrons, as the nature of the Radiant particles, try to fill up all the void. 

This is also why light spreads in a 360 degree sphere from the source to fill all spaces as quickly as possible.  

current is charge amount (quantity)
voltage is energy per charge (quality)
power is quality and quantity 



### Electrical Energy Comes from Virtual Photons, Not Electrons

A common misconception is that electrical energy comes from electrons. People think that a light bulb is powered by the electrons from the battery or powerplant. 

In reality, the energy comes from the virtual photons that exist just outside the lightbulb. 

These virtual photons need a channel to transfer and focus their energy to be converted into motion, heat, or light.  

These channels are provided by the electrons that flow through the wire. 

A generator or battery gathers a lot of electrons, compressing them. These then naturally flow to a wire which has less electrons. 
- In chemistry, this is called oxidation.


This flow creates a channel needed by the surrounding virtual photons which then spins the electrons as they travel through the wire as electricity.

The electricity passes through the filament of the light bulb which then seprates the 3D virtual photons into 3D heat and 2D light particles out of the electricity, releasing them into the vacuum tube. 

The electrons lose energy and are no longer compressed. This prevents them from creating channels to get more virtual photons. 
- In a DC circuit, the electrons flow 1-way and are reduced at the end to let keep the electrons flowing
- In an AC circuit, they flow back an forth, like a larger 2-way freight train.    

As we can see, the DC battery and AC generator do not supply the energy. 
- Instead, they supply the freight trains that get the energy from space and crudify them for physical purposes. 

  energy onstead, all the energy is already in the field. The battery merely supplies the way to harvest that energy.


## Free Energy From Spacetime

The proper configuration of electrons to harness the virtual photons from space is the key to electricity and therefore free energy. 

Nikola Tesla knew that space had infinite energy and is why he tried to develop free energy generation and wireless power transmission. But he didnâ€™t know Cartesian Physics and how to harvest those energies
