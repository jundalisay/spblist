The quanta of radiance are electrons, muons, and taus. 


Quantum | Mass
--- | --- | ---
Electron | 0.5 MeV
Muon | 105.66 MeV
Tau | 1.777 MeV 


### The Radiant Internal Boundary: Higgs Field

The Higgs Field gives electromagnetic potential to radiant particles. 

Physics says that this gives mass to particles. However, in Material Superphysics, this cannot be because mass is the amount of matter in a body and is from the aetherspace around quarks.

Rather, the Higgs Field condenses radiant waves into non-media particles such as into electrons.
