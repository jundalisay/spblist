There are 2 kinds of magnetism based on layer:

1. Vortexless or Material Magnetism 

This is natural magnets in the material layer caused by natural channels in metals.

This is created by:
- the natural channels in ferromagnets
  - Ferromagnets have channels because they do not close 
- the alignment of magnetic domains in metals
  - A channel can align by putting it through a strong magnetic field. 


2. Vortex Magnetism or Electromagnetism

This is created by:
- the magnetic moment of particle
  - This is from the channels formed by the spinning particle
- the orbital magnetism of atoms
  - This is from the channels formed by orbital movement



Object | Mechanism
--- | ---
Magnetic Moment | Hole or Gap in Particles
Electromagnet | Channels created by electricity
Superconductors | Channels created by coldness
Cling wrap | Static electricity acting as channels
Gecko feet | Electron density acting as channels

## Magnetic Fields: Divergence and Curl

A magnetic field is created by a channel in matter. The entrance and exit of the channel are the 2 poles. 

This channel allows virtual photons to enter from one side and exit the other. This creates:
- a low pressure at the entrance, called a negative divergence, and inside the channel
- a high pressure at the exit, called a positive divergence

The virtual photons at the exit go back the lowest pressure at the entrance in order to equalize the imbalance the pressures. 
- This creates a flowing circular pattern called 'curl' that is part of a magnetic field in Physics.
- a positive curl is a clockwise rotation in the field
- a negative curl is an anticlockwise rotation



## The Lesser Magnetic Forces

The attractive and repulsive forces done through virtual photons and electrons of the Radiant Layer produce the following foces:

Force | Description 
--- | --- 
Electromotive Force (EMF) | Conversion of energy to electrical energy via electrons
Van der Waals Force | The magnetic effect by static electricity 

<!-- gives the direction for thloops back or 'curls' around that entrance or exit.  -->

<!-- 1. Quantum Level
2. Substance Level
3. Version (chemical element) Level 
4. Material Level

In Cartesian Physics, the mechanism for magnetism is similar to that of light: There has to be straight, continuous channels which the virtual photons can pass through unimpeded. 
- An alignment for virtual photons leads to magnetic bodies
- An alignment for photons leads to transparent bodies -->
