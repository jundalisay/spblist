In 1924, Pauli introduced the concept of spin which he called "2-valuedness" to explain the anomalous Zeeman effect

Atoms (Cartesian 3rd Element) emit a light (Cartesian 1st Element) when put under magnetism (striated 1st Element)

This light sometimes splits into 3, called a Zeeman effect, as a proof of the energy levels (Cartesian vortex orbits or paths) of the electron

But it also "anomalously" splits into 9, as a proof of the energy levels of orbits 

This led to Pauli inventing the concept of spin which actually matched that of Descartes who described all particles as spinning vortices having effective shapes as globules, corkscrews, rods, helixes, etc an improvement of the Platonic shapes

Cartesian spin is either clockwise or anticlockwise, whether for charges (positive/negative), gravity (gravity/antigravity), colors (towards red/violet), matter (matter/antimatter), DNA (RNA/DNA), societies (division/unity), etc

At this point, electron paths are no longer Newtonian-Classical since Newton never imagined orbits splitting split up

But it is still Cartesian-Classical, just as a flow of water can split up into many smaller flows

But since no one knew Cartesian Physics, Bohr and Pauli had to create a new field called Quantum Physics which was opposed to Newtonian

The big difference with the spin of Pauli and Descartes is that Pauli's spin is constrained by the E=mc^2 dogma from the scammer Einstein

This prevented him from thinking of electrons as spinning globules that go clockwise or anticlockwise

Instead, he uses "integer" and "half-integer" which are numerical, not visual

He replaces the easy concept of side-by-side or top-to-bottom particle orientation with overly complicated symmetrical and antisymmetrical wave functions.

German precision thus further corrupted Physics which was already corrupted by British matter-ialism. 

Lorentz correctly guessed that the proton was the splitting mechanism. But could not explain how electron orbits could split.

 because he also didn't know Cartesian Physics.



Therefore we Lorentz. This is simiar to how the sun creates orbits. 

But the sun cannot anomalous orbits because it uses spacetime and not the aetherspace. 

The aether+space is a totally different space that is linked to the aether just as electro+weak is linked to electrons.

1930 neutrino. 

A neutrino goes through matter because it is very small and flexible. This allows it to go with the aetherspace and pass through, staying unnoticed. 

The spacetime around liquids are also flexible 

A peacful sociey has aligned or inclusive members. Examples are loving marriages, cohesive sports teams, golden ages. 

A warring society has non-aligned or exlcusive members. Examples are divorces, failed teams, dark ages. 

 and so it oscillates
