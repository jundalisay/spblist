In 1924, Pauli introduced the concept of spin which he called "2-valuedness" to explain the anomalous Zeeman effect

Atoms (called 3rd Element in Cartesian Physics) emit a light (called 1st Element) when put under magnetism (striated 1st Element).

This light sometimes splits into 3, as a "Zeeman effect". This exposes the energy levels (Cartesian vortex orbits or paths) of the electron

Light also "anomalously" splits into 9. This exposes the energy levels of orbits.

This led to Pauli inventing the concept of spin which actually matchea the theory of spinning vortices of Descartes.


### Vortex Theory

Descartes described all particles as spinning vortices having effective shapes as globules, corkscrews, rods, helixes, etc. 
- These shapes are an improvement of the Platonic shapes

Cartesian spin is either clockwise or anticlockwise, whether for:
- charges (positive/negative)
- gravity (gravity/antigravity)
- colors (towards red/violet)
- matter (matter/antimatter)
- DNA (RNA/DNA)
- societies (division/unity), etc

<!-- A peacful sociey has aligned or inclusive members. Examples are loving marriages, cohesive sports teams, golden ages. 

A warring society has non-aligned or exlcusive members. Examples are divorces, failed teams, dark ages. 

 and so it oscillates 
 -->

At this point, electron paths are no longer Newtonian-Classical since Newton never imagined orbits splitting split up.

But they are still Cartesian-Classical, just as a flow of water can split up into many smaller flows.

But since no one knew Cartesian Physics, Bohr and Pauli had to create a new field called Quantum Physics which was opposed to Newtonian.

The big difference with the spin of Pauli and Descartes is that Pauli's spin is constrained by the `E=mc^2` dogma from the scammer Einstein.

This prevented him from thinking of electrons as spinning globules that go clockwise or anticlockwise.

Instead, he uses "integer" and "half-integer" which are numerical, not visual.

He replaces the easy concept of side-by-side or top-to-bottom particle orientation with overly complicated "symmetrical" and "antisymmetrical" wave functions.

German precision thus further corrupted Physics which was already corrupted by British matter-ialism. 


## The Nucleus as the Splitting Mechanism through the Aetherspace

Lorentz correctly guessed that the proton was the splitting mechanism. 

This is simiar to how the sun creates orbits. 

But the sun cannot anomalous orbits because it uses spacetime and not the aetherspace. 

The aetherspace is a totally different space that is linked to the aether just as electroweak is linked to electrons. 

Unfortunately, Lorentz could not explain how electron orbits could split because he also didn't know Cartesian Physics.
