Cartesian Wave-Particle Duality and Double-Slit

In 1632, Descartes wrote about the wave-particle duality of electromagnetism (which he called the 1st Element) by using the analogy of grapes and grape juice in a vat with 2 holes.

Imagine that the solar system is a vat filled with grape juice and crushed grapes. 

The juice represents light and virtual photons which go in straight lines. The crushed grapes are the electromagnetic particles (electrons, muons, neutrinos, etc.).

The juice is propelled by energy (now called electromagnetic fields) and can be stopped by removing that energy. This has been proven by the Lene Hau experiment. 

Cutting 2 slits into the vat will make the juices flow out as waves in straight lines, but not the grapes. 

When the juice hits something, its trajectory will be deflected or bent.

The 2 slits are the eyes that are hit by the light, causing the light to refract and hit the retina to become data, as impressions on the "animal spirit" particles that are inside the nerves.  

The data from the 2 eyes "interfere" with each other, and so the brain has to compensate and merge them in the visual cortex.

Unfortunately, the brain can only work with the data sent by eyes. 

This allows optical illusions such as the grid illusion wherein the inaccuracy of the refraction by the retina causes the black squares to be put in the intersections of the grid. 

This causes gray shades to appear in varying intensities continuously, representimg the constant changes in the retina.

The data is also the basis for ideas and memory 

Cartesian Physics not only unites Classical and Quantum Mechanics through its 5 Elements model, but also all sciences, even biology with data science (via neurons and neural neworks)

So in Cartesian Physics, all light is "entangled" in Nature. This is revealed when they are split by prisms. 

and turn into particles whenever they hit anything, whether as sunlight shining on a ball, or a laser being split by a prism. 

and "particlization" "wavization" (such as the Bose condensate)

  detect light but not the other particles. 

True motion or potential motion. 

No matter what shape the parts of the eye may have, it is impossible for them to make the rays coming from different points assemble precisely at specific points. Dioptrique, Discourse 5
