The Hall Effect (which creates resistance) will lead to anti-gravity for vehicles. 

This is because in Cartesian Physics, both gravity and magnetism are caused by invisible spacetime particles called the 2nd Element. This is the same principle why Einstein made inertial mass = gravitational mass. i.e. his fabric of spacetime is Descartes' spacetime liquid. The main difference is that Einstein sources the warping from mass, whereas Descartes sources the vortices from the aether.

The resistance in the Hall Effect is caused by the 2nd Element inserting itself in the flow of electricity, just as anti-gravity and magnetism is caused by the 2nd Element inserting itself between 2 masses. 

All of this is 'wrong' in Newtonian Physics. But I'm talking about Cartesian Physics, not Newtonian. So of course, I will always 'get things wrong' in the Newtonian paradigm. So there is no need for you to ask why I always get things wrong, because I'm not using your 'correct' paradigm anyway.

You think Hall Effect anti-gravity is laughably ridiculous. But I laugh at you even more for ridiculing the solution, like a kid who laughs at 3+2=5 because he believes 3+2=3 (where the 5 represents the 5 Elements). 

An Linux operating system will always be 'wrong' to a Macbook fanboy. But the Linux user doesn't care because his Linux is correct for him and already works and provides benefits and happiness anyway. The Linux user can share its awesome features to help others who are stuck with planned obsolesence, high cost, and slow performance. But there are always those who stick to Macs for their status symbol. 

Likewise, Cartesian Physics, levitating monks, UFOs, alternative medicine will always be wrong to materialists. But a Cartesian will still share how Descartes solves everything. 

But there are always those who want to stay ignorant because it's convenient and safe. They align with Einstein because people have been conditioned to believe that he was a genius, even if he really killed scientific discovery by killing the aether (the non-obvious) and putting light (the obvious) as the supreme principle.
