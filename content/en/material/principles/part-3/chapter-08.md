Chapter 3 explained that Radiant force particles have 2 motions:

1. A rotation motion "sideways"

This shows their qualitative nature.

2. A straight-line motion forward

This shows their quantitative nature.


This represents the duality or polarization of the Radiant Layer, as the expression of the Positive and Negative Forces:

Vortex | Polarity
--- | ---
Vortex or Spin Direction | Negative (Male) and Positive (Female) Charge
Vortex or Spin Orientation | Up and Down


<!-- Integer Spin and Half-Integer Spin  -->


## Spin Direction: Male and Female charge


In Material Superphysics, particles actually spin. A 'charge' is therefore the rotation direction of a particle.

Technically, this would mean that an electron of a negative charge would be rotating positively. This would be confusing*. 

{{< n n="The setting of electrons are negatively charged came from [Benjamin Franklin](https://whyy.org/articles/does-our-confusing-electrical-nomenclature-start-with-ben-franklins-theory)" >}}


This is why we use 'male' and 'female' for 'negative' and 'positive' charges of Physics instead.
- The male charge represents a particle having an inherent positive (anticlockwise) rotation   
- The female charge represents a particle having an inherent negative (clockwise) rotation

<!-- The union of two vortices rotating in the opposite direction produces friction.

This friction downgrades the spatial qosts into radiant qors.

In the radiant layer, this duality takes the form of male and female charges. 

Unlike the spatial layer, the union of male and female charges does not create friction. 

Instead, it creates union and stability. This is why we chose the name of male and female. -->

### History of Male and Female Analogy in Metaphysics

Historically, the ancient Vedics and Taoists:
- assigned the male character to the Positive Force 
- assigned the female character to the Negative Force

By going through the particle shapes, we realized that this is because the force particles have a positive direction or rotation. These then go into matter particles which have gaps of holes for them.

So the force particles are like male penises and the matter particles are like female vaginas. This then explains why the Vedics worshipped the penis and vagina as phallus and yoni worship, respectively.

This is based on:
- the Positive Force being called masculine Shiva or Yang
- the Negative Force being called feminine Shakti or Yin

This naming is also useful and intuitive for neutral charges which we call bisexual. A neutral or bisexual charge is produced when a male and female cancel each other.


> A charge is the rotation direction of a particle

This will be consistent in the convertible layer which has the concept of 'flavor-changing' which we can equate to 'sex-change' in particles.

- Like-charges, such as male to male, or female to female, create repulsion.
- Opposite-charges, such as male to female, create attraction. 


In fact, William Gilbert, who documented Earth's magnetism, calls the attraction as Magnetick [Coition](/research/gilbert/book-2/chapter-03) which means sexual intercourse. 


### Ions

Ions are atoms or molecules that gain or lose a male electron, making them:
- masculine if they gain electrons
- feminine if they lose electrons

This is why 'negative' ions make us feel positive, and 'positive' ions make us feel negative.

<!-- Rather than confuse everyone by calling the negative as positive, we would rather call:
- the negative as 'feminine charge'
- the positive as a 'masculine charge'
- the neutral as a 'bisexual charge' -->


{{< img src="/graphics/physics/atomcharges.jpg" alt="Superphysics Electron" cap="In Superphysics, electrons have a masculine charge" >}}


{{< q c="Kybalion" >}}
We shall use the word "Feminine" in the place of "Negative" in speaking of that pole of activity.

Male Particles | Female Particles | Bisexual

## So What's the Use of Male and Female Charges? 

The charges are a consequence of identities in the Radiant layer charting a course towards the Material layer via the Convertible layer. Using genders allows a intuitive and more diversified classification that is more robust than mere positive or negative. For example, binary male and female has variations as:

- lesbian
- gay
- agender
- cisgender
- non-binary
- two-spirit
- genderfluid    

These then lead to different combination-dynamics such as:

- male + genderfluid
- lesbian + gay
- lesbian + agender
- etc

Such combinations then have different properties which might be useful in the real world. These could lead to new specialized compounds or materials. Coming up with new compounds would be more difficult in a non-intuitive system that merely has positive-negative. 


<!-- ## Quantum of Electricity 

As you can see, we call electron a (female) qoe [pronouncued "khoe"], and the tau a heavy qoe. We can replace all arbitrary names with this more natural system.
 -->

<!-- Gendered charges are a logical effect of flipping the materialist belief that energy and force comes from matter or the moving body. 

The gender system instead believes that the force comes from outside the body. This is proven by the Poynting vector which shows that the energy for a light bulb does not come from the battery but from the field aruond the bulb. 

So the virtual photons are males that go inside to screw female matter to give its force. 

We are not just pushing for genered charges because it gives the particle interactions a more natural context, instead of being soulless and numerical (since numbers are just quantity and have no other quality). 

It is because the discovery of the aether will lead to better control of chemical reactions leading to new compounds.

So gendered charges help classify the new compounds just as the periodic table made the classification of elements easier via proton number. 

So gendered charges are more for Chemistry, not Physics.

In Cartesian Physics, particle spin is actual spinning. This is not accepted in Physics because Heisenberg did not know about the aether which is the "backstage" of physical phenomena. 

And so his mind rejected physical particle spin because increased energy will allow violations of physical constants.  

But Cartesian Physics knows the aether. And so there is a backstage where particles that violate the constants can go to, and tunnel to other stages as other spacetimes. 

The 3/2 spin of electrons is split by Nature into cooper pairs of quasi-particles. If you didn't know how spacetime limits c, then you will not know how it creates Cooper pairs.
