Male and Female charges represent the rotation direction of a spinning particle. 

Its **rotation orientation**, on the other hand, debited by up or down spin. 

This is revealed by running the particle through a magnetic field.
- This is because a magnetic field, as explained in Chapter 3, is really a flow of virtual photons `mor2`.
- These virtual photons are columnar in nature and so they corkscrew through other particles.


This columnar nature is the reason why Physics calls photons or force particles as being `spin 1`. 
- Matter particles on the other hand are flatter and non-columnar. 
- This makes them have a 'half-integer' spin.


When a `mor2` corkscrews through a particle, it causes that particle to spin.

An electron or `qor1` has spin `1/2`. And so a magnetic field will cause:
- half of the electrons to go in one direction and
- the rest to go to another. 

This can be explained classically without any quantum mechanics. 

In fact, this is what Lorentz and Zeeman assigned as the cause for the Zeeman Effect. 



### The Big Problem with Quantum Spin of Physics

In Physics, quantum spin is how fast a particle comes back to its original state upon being rotated in space.

- A spin 0 does not change its state when its space changes
  - This is a point
- A spin 1 means its state changes as fast as its space changes
  - This is a vector
- A spin 2 means its state changes 2x as fast as its change in space (relative to spin 1)
  - This is a double vector
- A spin 1/2 "Fermions" 

- Media particles have an "integer" spin
- Quantum particles have a "half-integer" spin

Spin | Sample Particle
--- | ---
0 | Higgs Boson
1 | Photon 
2 | Graviton 


The whole problem with the Physics version began when Wolfgang Pauli discredited classical particle spin by saying that it violates the speed of light because the particle would have to spin or rotate faster than light.

This is one of the dogmas created by Einstein's Relativity.

<!-- and is why Einstein is such an evil person in the intellectual sense. -->

We explain that the electron spins within the speed of light because it needs 2 virtual photons to actually reach the speed of light. 

 <!-- travel slower than the speed of light.     -->

This means that:
- the electron will always spin within the speed of light
- the electron has a limit on its maximum force

If follows that:
- spin 1 particles spin at the speed of light
- spin 2 particles spin faster than the speed of light -- this is the nature of the spatial layer with confines the radiant

This also means that spin 3/2, 5/2, and higher can spin faster than the speed of light. **It follows that they can change their location in space and time.** 

Therefore spins that are higher than 1 is the requirement for teleportation and levitation which changes a particles spacetime location.

<!-- light has direction as polarization    -->

<!-- Particle | Spin | Spin States
--- | --- | ---
Photon (mor1) | 1 | 3
Electron (qor1) | 1/2 |  -->

<!-- Flat 3-dimensional particles have a "spin" of 1/2 in Physics because they can flip. 

Linear and columnar particles have a "spin" of 1 in Physics because they are rigidly linear.

However, there are particles that can be linear and flat. Examples are:
- spacetime particles
- heat particles -->


<!-- For example, heat has a force that can make things expand. This is when heat switches from linear, going with photons, to flat, going with spacetime.

Likewise, spacetime particles can go from linear, as the force of gravity and dark matter, to being flat, as energetic vortices (barycenters) or empty space which have less energy.

Cartesian Physics is all about vortices whether it be spiral galaxies, spinning black holes, vortex hurricanes, or DNA helixes. 

Subatomic vortices are known as particle spin in Modern Physics which have the characeristics of charge and helicity. 

A particle is either positive, negative, or neutral based on Benjamin Franklin's naming convention. 

We replace this with female, male, and bisexual charge to stand for clockwise, anticlockwise, and cancelling rotations.  

This will make isotopes more intuitive, as an atom being more unstable or unsure of itself the more bisexual neutrons it has.

For example, Deuterium has less neutrons than Tritium and is more stable.

Uranium-235 has less neutrons than Uranium-238 and is more focused and fissile. 

Spin number is the ratio of force-particles that are needed to spin the matter-particle. For example, an electron is spin 1/2 and so needs 2 virtual photons to make a complete turn. 

Spin 3/2 and 5/2 particles therefore spin faster than the physical speed limit. This is why they are split up into "Cooper pairs" by spacetime. 

However, negating this effect by spacetime will lead to teleportation of matter. 

All particles move forward in space. Heliity is whether they move forward anticlockwise (right-handed) or clockwise (left-handed).

Helicity is relevant mostly for the weak force and particle decay. There are only left-handed neutrinos because W boson are huge relative to it, forcing it to move bottom-first.
