In Principia Philosophia, Rene Descartes writes that invisible spacetime particles travel in straight lines. 



When encountering matter, this makes them push on that matter from all sides and turn it into a sphere, whether droplets or planets or stars. This is now known as surface tension in Physics.

In large material objects, such as spherical planets, this push manifests as gravity. Things are heavy or light depending on how their matter oppose or permit those spacetime particles to pass through. 

Heavy objects, such as iron, have less internal space or pores to let those spacetime particles pass. This increases the pushing force on iron. A wooden block of the same size has more pores, and so has less pushing force and consequently is lighter. 

Therefore to REDUCE the weight of a mass, a process which we call prelevitation, the pores must be aligned to make the spacetime particles pass through.

To CONTROL the pushing force, a process which we call levitation, the alignment must be manipulated in real time, adding or reducing the force of the spacetime particles as desired.

Descartes applies this same principle of pores on living bodies by explaining how the growth of plants and animals can be increased.

In Excerpta Anatomica, he explains how living particles which he calls 'animal spirits' go with the invisible spacetime particles in order to create growth through the splitting pores of the human body. At old age, the pores stop splitting and so growth stops. 

We apply these principles to create a prelevitation and growth rig.

We put a weight on a weighing scale and expose it to wave-emissions. These change the pores of the weight, reducing its resistance to the spacetime particles. This results in reduced weight. 

This principle was used by the Egyptians to create a construction industry that allowed them to build great pyramids without Newtonian principles. 

Monks do this by using their own bodies as the rig that they bombard with waves.

This principle is used by aliens to create a transportation industry in the form of UFOs that can travel anywhere in spacetime without Newtonian principles.

Lastly, we bombard a seedling with waves in order to make its pores absorb more nutrition and thus grow faster. 

This principle was used in agricultural societies to increase plant growth without the need for chemical fertilizers that damage the soil. 

In our first attempt, we were able to make a 1kg mass lighter by 1 gram, or a 0.001% reduction. In our second attempt, we were able to make a 320 gram weight lighter by 2 grams, or a 0.006% reduction. 

Our plant (Brassica rapa chinensis) was able to grow faster in 30 days instead of the usual 40. 

Our next goal is to increase the efficacy to 0.01% in weight and to try more complex plants such as tomatoes. 

These experiments flip Physics on its head by making the aether as the superior principle over matter. 

This overhauls Newtonian Physics and totally destroys Einstein's sophistical Theory of Relativity which only works within the fire-aether or the Electromagentic spectrum but fails everywhere else (i.e It is only applicable to electrons and light, but not to anti-gravity, medicine, botany, psychology, sociolgoy, etc.).

Cartesian Physics therefore unifies all sciences and allows new technologies that are better, cheaper, or less damaging than the current ones.
