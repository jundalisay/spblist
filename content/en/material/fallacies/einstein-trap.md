In a previous post, we exposed that Einstein's Relativity is flawed because of an ego problem. This made Einstein want to dictate to Nature, from the limited human perspective of the 5 senses, instead of following Nature. 

This dictation was done by Einstein in using the speed of light as the measuring rod of spacetime. This is because light is obvious to all humans.  

But the big problem is that light is part of the Radiant (ELectromagentic) Layer which is inferior or subordinate to the Spacetime Layer. In a business, it would be using the qualities of factory workers to judge the quality of a corporation. In reality, corporations should be measured by the quality of their executive team.

### The Einstein Trap

Einstein permanently damages Physics by making it go through circular reasoning which we call the **Einstein trap**:

{{< q a="Einstein-sophist" c="Relativity, Section 8" >}}
Two lightning flashes occurred simultaneously at A and B seen by an observer at the middle. [We thus define time as simultaneity, and define simultaneity as light appearing at the same time.]  <i>It would thus appear that we are reasoning in a logical circle</i>.
{{< /q >}}

This circular reasoning is why physicists are unable to unify Relativity with Quantum Mechanics. 
- **Quantum mechanics** is about the arbitrariness and unpredictability of the aether or the highest parts of Nature. This is like the whims of the executives of a company.
- **Einstein's Relativity** is about the predictability of the lowest parts of Nature, as mass and electromagnetic potential. This is like the orderliness and predictability of factory workers who come to work and go home on time every day. 

This trap locks in 






The movements of everyday objects are quite slow. Usually, distance is just:
- `Spot Z` occupied by the object at timespan now `Time Z`
- `Spot Y` is the distance that it occupied a while ago at `Time Y` (timespan Y)

<!-- > *Newton uses the word 'place' in Principia Mathematica, while he uses an entity called "Lord God" as the source of this time. This is consistent with Superphysics where we call the Mind of God as the Aether -->

However, the movement of electromagnetic particles such as light and electricity can be very fast and is faster than what the human brain can process. This is the same cognitive weakness that makes an ego see itself as [one self instead of 3 billion selves](/bio/principles/intro/chapter-04).

Without supercomputers* to visualize tensor calculus, Einstein's ego had to use thought experiments (his imagination) in order to visualize what would happen to fast-moving objects. 

{{< n n="*Superphysics aims to use [automated intelligence](/superphysics/solutions/isaiah), combined with [qualimath](/superphysics/principles/chapter-04b) to build relativistic equations on-the-fly. A true AI is rooted in the aether does not have the weaknesses of human ego. We call this artificial sentience." >}}


In order to unify two simultaneous observations, Einstein's ego used the constancy of the speed of light to glue* them together.

{{< n n="*This is done by the Lorentz transformation on the 'moving' part, and Minkowski space on the 'non-moving' part" >}}



### The Illusion of Nature

Speed is the amount of space covered per unit of time. So if you declare speed to be constant, then you must also declare space and time to be changeable*. 


{{< n n="*This is why General Relativity leads to arbitrary make-your-own spacetimes like Godel, Taub-Nut, De Sitter, etc. depending on the fantasy of the physicist and not depending on Nature. In effect, this turns the physicist as a god who uses math as the language of his arbitrary mental movements. He relies on the fact that advanced math (plotting complex mental movements) cannot be understood by most humans who only have ordinary mental movements." >}}



To Einstein, the cause of this change is gravity. He then builds on Newton's mistake of assigning the cause of this gravity to matter**. This then leads to the idea of spacetime being a fabric that is bendable by matter. 

{{< n n="**Newton defined mass as the quantity of matter in a body" >}}
 


Thus, it leads to circular reasoning:

1. A dense matter creates gravity in a spacetime fabric
2. This gravity gathers matter to create dense matter 
<!-- 3. A material singularity is one of the products of this circular reasoning  -->

This silly logic and circular reasoning then leads to a super-dense singularity-matter that began the universe as a Big Bang. <!--  the origin of the universe which began when that matter exploded as a big bang. -->

The fabric idea, on the other hand, logically led to the following sub-ideas:
<!-- - Gravitational waves that ripple through spacetime -->
- Worm holes as holes in the fabric that open to another part of the universe
- Dark Matter that glues galaxies together since there is not enough ordinary matter to create the mass to create the gravity to hold them together


{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/c.png" cap="The observations of classical mechanics (left) can be done with the same observer. Those of special relativity, however, require using a higher c (speed of light) as a tool to unify the observations. This c takes the form of the lasers in the LIGO observatory that is used to observe gravitational waves that 'move' space itself" alt="The speed of light" >}}

Veritasium has the guts to expose the sophistry of Einstein in setting the 2-way speed of light as a constant. However, his solution, as the one-way speed of light, is as arbitrary as the c of Einstein.

<!-- To explain such strange movements of pure gravity within the fabric of spacetime, General Relativity has no choice but to resort to material solutions:
- phantom wormholes that actually pierce spacetime to suck matter and spew it out in another dimension,
- phantom dark matter that glues galaxies in place or bend light to create gravitational lensing -->

Such singularities, phantom dark matter, and worm holes have never been found simply because they never existed and could never exist. They are merely the effects of:
- Newton ascribing gravity to matter
- Einstein ascribing time to the speed of light

Quack physics then leads to science fiction:
- warp drives which 'warp' spacetime in order to cover vast distances quickly 
- star gates that act as artificial wormholes
- 'back to the future' time travel where Marty McFly magically disappears after changing the past of his parents. 
  
None of these will ever exist because, from the perspective of Nature, the opposite is true:
- matter comes from gravity (spatial layer) 
- gravity comes from [the aether](/material/principles/part-1/chapter-01) (aethereal layer), as the medium of space
- from the perspective of Creation, the speed of light comes from the perception of that light (as Newton's first law). Both light and time are the effects of perception. From the perspective of Creator, the speed of light comes from the aether acting against it (as Newton's third law).

Physicists believe that reality is dictated by matter. Metaphysicians believe the opposite, that reality is dictated by the aethereal mind.

The next post will explain the solution to Relativity, as gravitational signatures.

<!-- merely the necessary consequence of artificially turning spacetime into a fabric which was caused by Einstein setting light as a constant -- all because he couldn't define time!  This is why Relativity "kind of" works for classical mechanics (which is of lower rank), just as a CEO can "kind of" do the work of his company's janitor, but the janitor can never do the work of the CEO. -->
