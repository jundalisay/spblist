The Arrow of Time is a non-problem arising from Time being based on perception of the change in states.

There are 2 changes in states: 

1. Physical
2. Mental

The physical changes in the physical universe are caused by physical energy.
- Physical state-changes are observed through the medium of light.

The metaphysical changes in the mental universe are caused by mental energy.


The gap between those changes is called time. This leads to 3 kinds of time based on our 5 Layer model:


1. Material Time as changes viewed from Matter

This is called absolute time in Classical Mechanics. 

2. Electromagnetic Time as changes viewed from Radiance

This is called relativistic time in Einstein's Physics. 

3. Mental Time as changes viewed from the Aether

The problem with physical time began in the late 19th century when the speed of light was formalized.

Einstein used this formal speed as his `c`. This then became the measure of physical energy by sight.
This necessarily formalized physical time as an 'arrow'.

It's an arrow because we **see** that energy always naturally spreads as entropy and never converges i.e. by design the universe spreads energy because that is how existence itself is maintained.

This corrupted the definition of time by making the 2 other times as electromagnetic. 



### The Start of the Non-Problem: The Quantum Eraser Experiment 

**The problem actually begins when scientists think about it.** This action confounds *physical* time with *mental* time.

> The problem with time actually begins when scientists think about it


This then leads to the notion of 'emergent time'. This is the exact sign that physical time and mental time have been mixed up by some physicist who has nothing better to do.


The confusion is seen in the **quantum eraser experiment** where entangled particles are thought to change the past observations. But later this was clarified to be a false interpretation only -- the experimenters were claiming retrocausality when what really happened was merely the randomness from interference and non-interference.  

<!-- Mental time in the physical context is explained by quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, such as in the , particles **teleport** instead of going back in time.

However, physics interprets it as going back in time because energy is always in a space and therefore time is the variable -- the particle 'goes back' into a previous energy state. -->

**This problem is easily resolved by not mixing up physical time and mental time.** 
- Physical time is 'proper time' in Einstein's Relativity
- Mental time is 'coordinate time' 

The physicist must stop thinking about the arrow of physical time, just as the entangled particle does not really care about its energy states -- it just gets those states when it hits something. 

 <!-- accepts those states, reacting to them without thinking. -->

This policy would save a lot of wasted mental effort and funding which should go to better uses like healthcare or environmental protection research.


### Light is not Superior

The blame for this falls squarely on Einstein because he decreed light, and therefore electromagnetic time, to be superior. 

Poincare, the original author of Relativity, did not assign supremacy to light. And so his Relativity never mixed up physical time and mental time -- he never bothers about the arrow of physical time.

This is proven in his Chapter ['The Measure of Time'](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Measure_of_Time)

If humans obey Einstein (and the materialists), then they will keep Physics stuck in a rigid box without any new discoveries.

If people obey Poincare-Lorentz (and the aetherealists) and merge Physics with Metaphysics, then they will free it up and unite Newtonian mechanics with Quantum physics.

<!-- If you believe that science should stay stuck and that the planet should heat itself up and cause life to go extinct (since there is no scientific solution), then Einstein logically is a genius. 

But if you believe that science should progress and we can get out of this heated planet by quantum teleportation and faster-than-light travel, then it follows that Einstein is a sophist who trapped humans in an extinction box, achieved faster with nuclear weapons which he himself promoted.
