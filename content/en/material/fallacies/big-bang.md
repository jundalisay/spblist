The Big Bang is a consequence of Einstein's sophistical General Relativity which imposes that the speed of light, and consequently information, travels at 300,000 kilometers per second. 

Therefore, the light from an object 600,000 kilometers away is 2 seconds old, different from its current light. 

This means that the light from very distant galaxies is billions of years old, closer to the age of the universe itself. That light would be from galaxies that are very young which means that they cannot possibly be fully developed. 

**Yet that's exactly what James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) shows.**

For example, JWST shows galaxy "Gz9p3" having the following properties:
- a Lyman break of 9.35. This shows that it is very far (and therefore very young to modern Physics)
- MUV of −21.66. This shows that it is very bright and massive (a quality of older galaxies)

To address this anomaly, researchers advise a revision of the star formation model (e.g. speed up star formation from the early universe), instead of the more common sense solution of **throwing away both ΛCDM cosmology and General Relativity**. Both CDM and Relativity are Einstein monstrosities that turn Nature upside down. 

## The Solution: Cartesian 5 Elements

The proper solution is Rene Descartes' 5 Elements model. This model divides the labor between the 5 Elements:

1. Aether
2. Spacetime
3. Light
4. Weak
5. Strong Force


These work together to create reality.

An analogy for the JWST findings is a bullet train on train tracks on ground. 
- The ground represents spacetime
- The tracks are lightwaves that travel through spacetime 
- The train is the information conveyed by those waves
- The speed of light is the rate of laying tracks. 
  - On good ground, the rate is 300 meters per work shift. On bad ground, it might be 100. On better ground, it might be 600.

Once the tracks have connected to both stations (star and telescope), then the bullet train travels instantly (or at least so much faster than the track-laying speed) between both ends. 

In fact, Descartes extends this motion of the aether as it goes from the telescope into our eyes, brain, and lastly into the aethereal soul that experiences it. 

This means that the distant galaxies that JWST observes are close to their current age instead of being billions of years old. This explains why they are already so massive and bright. (This also explains why entangled particles can teleport instantly.) 

This is why Descartes insisted that the speed of light was instant. He really meant that it was the speed of the aether within light that was instant. 

The data from the JWST supports Cartesian Physics and goes against Einstein's Relativity. In fact, we can safely delete all of Einstein's Theories and replace them with modified Lorentz-Poincare ones, except for Brownian motion.

Cartesian Physics not only solves all other Physics problems through the 5 Elements model, but also extends to solve problems in Biology, Medicine, Psychology and the Social Sciences. This makes it a unifier not only for Physics, but for all sciences. 

This will make it easier to solve problems by having a single framework to refer to, instead of having the current messy system with unconnected principles.






<!-- ### Why The Big Bang is Wrong 

The Big Bang comes from materialist thinking or the belief that matter is the supreme principle. This is because matter is the most obvious perception that everyone has. We can all see a ball, a rock, a stick.

Because of Newton and the 19th century, science has imposed that phenomena should be observable by all. The problem is that humans are a species limited to the 5 senses out of dozens or hundreds possible in Nature. 

The problem with this is that matter is the crudest of the 5 Elements. By imposing the supremacy of obvious material perceptions, then the non-obvious aethereal perceptions are negated even if they hold the true principles of Nature. 

Unlike Newtonian Mechanics which imposes the supremacy of matter, Einstein's Relativity upgraded Physics a bit by imposing the supremacy of Electromagnetism, as energy and light. 

If you are keen, you will notice that the m in E=mc2 is not really Newtonian mass, but electromagnetic potential. Therefore, all its 3 variables represent the Electromagnetic Element. 

Einstein's Relativity naturally falls apart when true spacetime is considered. This is what the JWST is showing. 


The Proper Cosmological Model 

In the proper Cartesian cosmology, which is in line with the ancient cosmology of the Greeks, Hindus, and Taoists, the aether is the supreme principle from where spacetime, heat, and matter comes from.

The heat from the CMB arose when spacetime became crudified which then arose when the pure aether became crudified. The crudifying force is called Yin in Taoism or Shakti in Hinduism, which we call the Negative Force, similar to the positive charge in particles. As such there is no baryonic matter to cause the heat from the CMB. Instead, the CMB fluctuations represent the uneven distribution of the aether as it was being crudified into spacetime which led to fluctuations in the resulting heat as spacetime itself was crudified.  

Gravity, Dark Matter, and Dark Energy are merely properies of spacetime, just as particles, waves, and information-carrier are properties of Electromagnetism. 

The properties of spacetime are exposed by observing it in different evolutions of human perception (i.e. pre-telescope, telescope, space telescope, infrared space telescope), just as the properties of light are exposed by observing it as it goes through different kinds of space (i.e. space on Earth, space in the solar system, space in galaxies, space between galaxies). 

Einstein's Relativity is not an incomplete theory. It is a wrong theory just as Ptolemy's geocentric theory is wrong even if it was championed by the best astronomers of his time. Einstein's Relativity will be a relic of wrong Physics just as no one today bothers to learn Ptolemy's spheres even if they matched limited observations in 100 AD.
