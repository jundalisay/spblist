In Descartes' Physics, the Photoelectric Effect is the downgrading of high energy light and cosmic energy (high fire-aether) into electrons (low fire-aether).

Normally, this is done by 'quantum tunneling' light and cosmic energy into spacetime vortices (stellar black holes in Newtonian Physics).

Without such black holes, this quantum tunneling can be done through specific metals. 

Accordingly this was done by Fritts in 1883, and Tesla in his 1901 patent. Tesla's causal mechanism was the aether which empowers high energy UV light, cathodic, and X rays. 

He said that the UV of sunlight had small energy particles that could be converted to electricity.

So Tesla already had the complete system that had quanta with quantum tunneling. If you develop his system with knowledge of the aether, then you get 4 technologies: 

1. Solar panels
2. Cosmic energy panels (non UV)\
3. Semiconductors
4. Fusion

By comparing the Einstein paper and the Tesla patent, one will discover that Einstein's real mechanism is Boltzmann's entropy and not quantum tunneling. This is why his paper led to zero tech. 

If we read all of the 1905 papers like a scam-investigator, we will see that the whole mechanism of Einstein's genius scam was putting light as the supreme principle with Boltzman. This destroyed:
- the mechanistic aether of Maxwell
- the abstract aether of Lorentz and Tesla

It is ok to define photon as a quantum of light. But do not make it the supreme principle.

Otherwise, you kill the laws of Physics. Nature will then not give you those technologies that can end the global warming that flooded Pakistan, burned Hawaii, and heated Europe.

> It is ok to define photon as a quantum of light. But do not make it the *supreme* principle.

Therefore, Einstein, along with the other Germans called Hitler and Marx, is like a cruel joke of Nature designed to make fools of humans.

Either Einstein burns you instantly with the nukes that he promoted, or through a slow cook through global warming.
