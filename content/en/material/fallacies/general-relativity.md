Spacetime is superior to Electromagnetism | Einstein's General Relativity is wrong, not incomplete

<!-- E :: G<sub>l</sub> as an alternative to E = mc{{< s v="2" >}} -->


While collating the works of Socrates in order to unify them with those of David Hume to harmonize Superphysics, I came upon his maxims on astrophysics: 

{{< q a="Socrates" c="Simple Republic by Plato, Chapter 7" >}}
The spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that higher knowledge. Any geometrician who saw them would never think that there is a true equal, true double, or true proportion in the spangled heavens. Likewise, a true astronomer..will never imagine that the proportions of night and day, the stars to one another are eternal and subject to no deviation. <!-- It is equally absurd to take so much pains in investigating their exact truth. -->
{{< /q >}}


Socrates is clearly against having any fixed ratio or absoluteness in the universe. This obviously debunks Newtonian Physics which has an idea for an absolute space: 

{{< q a="Newton" c="Principia, Scholium" >}}
Absolute space has no regard to anything external. It remains always similar and immovable.
{{< /q >}}

However, he also mentioned that light (through sight) is not the measure of cosmic objects:

{{< q a="Socrates">}}
The starry heaven is wrought on a visible ground. The most perfect of visible things is far inferior to the true motions of absolute speeds which are relative to each other. <i>They carry with them that which is contained in them</i>. These are to be apprehended by reason and intelligence, but not by sight.
{{< /q >}}

This also debunks Einstein's Relativity wherein light is an essential component:


{{< q a="Einstein" c="Relativity, Section 14" >}}
[The unity of the two postulates of relativity and c] led to the Lorentz transformation instead of the Galilei transformation of classical mechanics. The constant speed of light played an important part in this.
{{< /q >}}

<!-- But why must I distinguish the non-moving `K` body above all moving `K'` bodies by assuming that the ether is at rest relatively to the non-moving `K` body?  I think that such an asymmetry.. is intolerable. -->

Therefore, the correct replacement to Newton and Einstein should:
- have no absolutes (i.e. be relative)
- work even without light (i.e. intellectually derived from patterns of data through space and time, not from a single visual observation)


### Descartes to the Rescue 

Before Einstein and Newton, Rene Descartes already explained how the universe worked through the 5 Elements which we can call as the true "Standard Model" of Physics in completed form. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/1960s.png" a="5 Elements" c="The updated Descartes model fits with an expanded Standard Model since Nature is just one" >}}

Unlike Newton who viewed space as absolute, Descartes viewed space as relative:

{{< q a="Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia, Part 2, Article 13" >}}
I assert that all points are movable in the universe. From this, I conclude that nothing has a permanent place unless it is fixed by our thought.
{{< /q >}}

{{< n n="'Fixed by our thought' is consistent with the aether being superior to spacetime. It is proven by monks who use their minds to levitate and predict the future." >}}
 


Like Einstein, he denied gravity coming from inside objects. But unlike Einstein's Relativity which needed light, Descartes' Relationality needed only 2 or more identities:

{{< q a="Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia, Part 4, Article 202" >}}
I deny the existence of gravity inside any body. Gravity is a quality that depends on the relations of situation and motion of several bodies on each other.
{{< /q >}}

<!-- ### TLDR

We use the aether as the supreme principle. Aether is the substance of ideas, feelings, and of the abstract mind that has those ideas and feelings. Therefore, the idea of `G`, `c`, `h` (Planck's constant) are constants only because the aether sets it as so. If we upgrade our abstract minds, then we get new ideas and perceptions and `G`, `c`, `h` will change accordingly through us testing it in different parts of the galaxy, universe, and multiverse.  -->


In the view of Cartesian Physics, the biggest evils of Relativity are:

1. It prevents artificial faster than light movement
2. It prevents aether propulsion which uses subtle energy and far less crude energy  



## Let's Fix General Relativity!

To get rid of these evils, let's convert General Relativity (GR) to Cartesian. GR has field equations made up of 4 basic components: 

1. The Big Mass
3. The Small Mass
2. The Curvature around that Big Mass
4. How the Small Mass goes through that Curvature

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/gr2.jpg" a="General Relativity" >}}

We convert this to Cartesian Relationality:

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/rel.jpg" a="Relationality" >}}

This eliminates the complicated Curvature and how the Small Mass goes through that Curvature. This  eliminates 3-dimensional curved geometry and brings back 2-dimensional Euclidean geometry.

The resulting 2-dimensional Euclidean geometry forms 3-dimensional curved geometry when the object is traced along the plane or apparent space-time. 

The ratios between the 2 objects while being traced within the plane are notated through Francis Bacon Tables. These can then project the future positions of the object/s even if both are moving. 

{{< youtube lmsTdzBql5o >}}

The combination of Descartes and Bacon lead to a simpler and more robust way to plot the movement of objects going very fast. More importantly, light is not critical to this system. 

For example, we use it to plot the movement of:
- person twards disease in Medical Superphysics 
- lover towards lover in Social Superphysics
- country towards prosperity also in Economic Superphysics

In the future, we can use it to plot or predict:
- the probablities of what a particle will decay into
- the movement of an object from location A to B using the aether
- the growth of plants from one height or quality towards another 


### Meets Socrates' Requirements

Cartesian Physics meets Socrates' requirements of:

- having no absolutes (i.e. be relative)
- working even without light

This is why it makes up most of Material Superphysics, with minor tweaks from the Asian sciences of Hinduism, Taoism, and Buddhism in order to explain how the physical universe works.

Nov 2024 | Totally overhauled this article after formalizing Cartesian Relationality around Aug 2024. Instead of fixing General Relativity by replacing Einstein's spacetime with the Cartesian 2nd Element, we replaced it with Cartesian Relationality
