Physicists and astronomers were surprised that the James Webb Telescope revealed [new facts about the universe](https://webbtelescope.org/files/live/sites/webb/files/home/webb-science/early-highlights/_documents/2022-061-jades/JADES_CurtisLake.pdf)

1. The universe was spread out more evenly than expected
2. The oldest galaxies were smaller compared to our younger Milky Way and were [more than expected](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2311963120)

<!-- surprisingly many galaxies, galaxies that are surprisingly smooth, surprisingly small and surprisingly old. -->

To this we add earlier surprises from cosmic microwave background (CMB) data:

3. Gravitational waves did not exist in the CMB
4. The temperature differences in the CMB did not have much variety

{{< i s="/photos/physics/galaxy.jpg" a="Galaxy" >}}


The cause of these surprises was the false materialist belief called **The Big Bang Theory** which says that the universe began as a mass of singularity that exploded to create spacetime and the current galaxies. 

Such a theory would lead to the following assumptions:
- There should be more galaxies at a certain region of the universe compared to others
- Old galaxies should be bigger than new ones
- Gravitational waves should be present because there is expansion and therefore a fabric of spacetime
- There should be more temperature differences because of the expansion


Such assumptions were destroyed by the findings of:
- the James Webb Telescope which could detect red-shift, and thus, get more information about distant galaxies
- the Planck satellite which detected the CMB 


## The Cause of the Error: Confusing Time with Light

The whole cause of the error is the ignorance of physicists on the division of labor in Nature. In this case, they confuse and mix age and light together. 

For example, they know that the light from the sun takes 8 minutes to get to Earth. From this, they infer that that light is **8 minutes old** and is not exactly the same as the light that is just being emitted from the sun's surface. 
- The sunlight that hits the Earth is older than the light on the Sun's surface from an absolute point of view. 
- The sunlight that hits the Earth is younger than the light on the Sun's surface from the sun's point of view. 


They then extend this error onto distant galaxies. For example, they think that the light from a galaxy 1 billion light years away would be 1 billion years older from an absolute point of view. 

So they get perplexed when they see such old galaxies behaving as if they were just a few million years old. 

The Physics of Descartes (and Spinoza) gets rid of their confusion by saying that they are correct in thinking that the light from the sun takes 8 minutes to get here. **But they are wrong in saying that the information that goes with that light is also 8 minutes old. reality, the information from that light is current and up-to-date.** 


{{< img src="/graphics/physics/light.jpg" alt="Light is different from Information" cap="Physicists think that information travels at the speed of light. They do not know that information is really aethereal and travels instantly" >}}

This is why Descartes insisted that the speed of light is instantanous. He really meant **the speed of aethereal information within that light**. This is the same principle behind quantum entanglement, quantum teleportation, and pilot-wave theory.  

Descartes explained that light has 3 properties:

1. Info-carrier
2. Wave
3. Particle


{{< img src="/graphics/physics/lightprops.jpg" alt="Properties of Light" >}}

An analogy is a courier that delivers a TV (particle) to you. The delivery might take 8 minutes, but the TV show (info) is up to date.

The lag in electromagnetic communication is caused by the blockages caused by matter. Outer space has not much matter and so the information from stars is more or less current and up to date.

So those farther galaxies detected by the James Webb Space Telescope are not older. They are just farther. This makes their star formation normal.

The red shift is a property of spacetime, and not of light. It happens only at the edges of galaxies and stars where their territories clash with those of others. This clash creates the visible stretching. 

> Red shift is a property of spacetime, and not of light


There are no gravitational waves in the CMB because such waves are a product of black holes which are allied with light, and not microwaves. The latter is allied with time, and so the CMB is a better basis of the age of the universe than redshift. 


## Einstein is to Blame

Why did physicists confuse light and time? 

This is because Einstein used the speed of light as the measuring rod for space. Since spacetime is one being, then light also measures time. Therefore, the age of something is determined by its light. 

However, this is totally wrong because Spacetime (called the '2nd Element' in Cartesian Physics and 'Spatial Layer' in our Superphysics) is superior to Electromagnetism (called the 1st Element in Cartesian Physics and the Radiant Layer in Superphysics). 

It would be like using a janitor as the benchmark to judge the merits of a CEO or executive -- a good CEO is one who cleans toilets spotlessly and wipes all the windows clearly!

In Physics, this manifests as the Strong Force (called the 3rd Element by Descartes and the Material Layer in Superphysics) as being the highest principle. This leads to the Big Bang Theory which states that the universe came from a material singularity. From that singularity emerged spacetime and light. 

<!-- The spectra reveal that these primeval galaxies are extremely metal poor, have masses between 107 and a few times 108
solar masses, and young ages.. These findings demonstrate the rapid emergence of the first generations of galaxies at cosmic dawn. -->


<!-- ## The Cause of the Error

The Big Bang theory is totally flawed because it is based on the belief of Isaac Newton that **gravity comes from matter**. 

q a="Newton" c="Principia Mathematica, Definitions"
Mass is the amount of matter in a body.. The total motion of a body is the sum of all motions of its parts <b>and is based on its velocity and mass</b>.. 
Force is an external action exerted on the body in order to change its state.. This Force can come from impact, pressure, centripetal force..   A centripetal force draws a body towards a center. Examples are gravity which draws bodies to the centre of the earth..


Newton ascribes the cause of motion, including gravitational motion, to the mass, or amount of matter, of bodies. This leads him to assert that the universe has a center:

q a="Newton" c="Principia Mathematica Simplified, Proposition 11-12, Theorem 11-12"
<b>Hypothesis 1: The centre of the universe is immovable</b>
The common centre of gravity of the earth, the sun, and all the planets, is the centre of the universe. This is because the sun, and all the planets, mutually gravitate one towards another, and are therefore, according to their powers of gravity, in perpetual agitation. It is plain that their moveable centres can not be taken for the immovable centre of the world.

This is opposite of the cause discovered by Descartes, which is the **aether**. 
+

q a="descartes"
The power to move and the power that determines that motion's direction are 2 completely different things. These can exist one without the other (as I have set out in the Dioptrics). <b>Each part moves in the way least difficult for it by the bodies around it.</b>
<cite>Chapter 2, The World Simplified</cite>

The aether is the first mover which rolls around the universe at an incomprehensible speed. It is the origin and source of all the other motions found therein.
<cite>Chapter 3, The World Simplified</cite>


## Materialists Enshrine Matter, Dialecticians Enshrine the Aether

The matter-based mindset was enshrined by Newton, creating the Laws of Motion from it, leading to modern science. This overturned and replaced the then-established aether-based philosophical mindset from Descartes, who promoted the theory of aethereal vortices. 


q a="newton"
The hypothesis of vortices is problematic. 
<br>
It says that each planet by a radius drawn to the sun may describe areas proportional to the times of description, the periodic times of the several parts of the vortices should observe the duplicate proportion of their distances from the sun. The smaller vortices may maintain their lesser revolutions about Saturn, Jupiter, and other planets, and swim quietly and undisturbed in the greater vortex of the sun. 
<br>
But I have explained that the motions of the comets are very regular. These are governed by the same laws with the motions of the planets.  
<cite>Principia Mathematica Simplified</cite>


Scientifically, the dominance of matter is why research requires material evidence and material reproducability. This then incrementally increases the cost of research as time passes.

A research project in the 17th century is far cheaper than one done today and is why there were far more innovations in the past. It also leads to the current increase in slowness in research output, especially in physics and chemistry.  

In cosmology, the materialist mindset leads to the flawed Big Bang Theory.  -->

<!-- Therefore, the dominance of matter in the minds of post-Newton humans manifests as:
- the slowness of scientific research
- the lack of technological revolution comparable to the 18th century -->
<!-- - the problems associated with Capitalism and Communism -->



## The Proper Theory: Spacetime Waves in the Aetherspace

We bring back the superiority of Spacetime over Electromagnetism and Matter through the Aether as the aetherspace. 

Instead of a material big bang, the universe began as an [aethereal idea of the Supreme Mind](/material/principles/part-1/chapter-02/) which Hindu science calls *Saguna Brahma*.

So the Supreme had an idea for a physical univere and so deployed it in the aetherspace. This resulted in a universe with spacetime. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/age.jpg" alt="Age of the Universe" cap="" >}}

In the illustration above, each slice is a spacetime within the aetherspace. 

If you go back to the physical beginning of this universe, then you will merely experience a different version of this universe. 

This is because our universe is made known to use through waves of light in space.  If we try to chase the start of the universe, by chasing the red shift, we will find ourselves with new waves of light that will point to a new Big Bang. Rather our Big Bang would seem to "move back". This is seen nowadays as astronomers adding more age to our universe.


This means that **the universe has no single starting point other than the mind that is perceiving that universe**. 

- If the James Web Telescope teleported to another galaxy, it would see the same even distribution of galaxies. It would then recompute the age of the universe based on the perspective of that galaxy and find that the age is different. This would prove Descartes correct that the age and size of the universe is indefinite. 
- If it positioned itself at the edge of the known universe and tried to teleport beyond the edge, it would merely go to another nearly-exact universe and not go into a Void


Therefore, **the age of a universe depends on the star, galaxy, or layer where the perceiving mind is.** 

- Humans are on the Material Layer, as material creatures, going onto the Convertible and Radiant (Electromagnetic) Layers. From this layer, the universe is 13.8 billion years old. 

The emergence of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the birth of the Radiance (Electromagnetism) of our sector. **It is not the start of the universe.**   

- But from a mind or species that is in the Radiant (Electromagnetic) Layer, such as creatures made up of photons instead of atoms, the universe is just a few 'years' old.

- From a species in the spacetime layer, the universe is a few 'days' old. 

- From a species in the aethereal layer, the universe is a few 'seconds' old and even instantaneous. This is because the aethereal layer is closest to the non-layer which we call 'probabilty'. Moreover, it is also above spacetime, making time irrelevant. This then makes questions of age or timespan irrelevant.  


> The age of a universe depends on the star, galaxy, or layer where the perceiving mind is

The layer that the mind occupies then depends on the strength of [the Negative Force](/superphysics/principles/chapter-03e/) on it.

As material creatures, the human species has a lot of Negativity within it, as well as other material animals and plants. This negativity manifests as the conflicts, recessions, inequality, stress from working for money, and other kinds of suffering that seems inseparable from human nature. Even plants and animals have to struggle to survive, proving the confinement of the Negative on them. 



## Our Unification Solution for Newton and Descartes

To solve the conflict between materialists and 'aetherealists' for good, we equate the aether to Newton's 'Spirit' which he says dominates matter. 

{{< q a="newton" c="Principia Mathematica Simplified" >}}
A Spirit pervades and lies hidden in all gross bodies. Its action and force causes the particles of bodies to mutually attract one another at near distances, cohere if contiguous, emit light and heat bodies.
 
All animal bodies move at the command of the will through the vibrations of this Spirit. These vibrations travel from our sense organs to the brain and from the brain to the muscles.  My work can lay the foundation to discover how this Spirit operates.
{{< /q >}}


Therefore, Netwon ascribes gravity to matter which is then dominated by an aethereal Spirit. In short form, this makes the aether the root cause of gravity, made perceivable by matter. This is the same as what Descartes was explaining. 

Therefore, both Newton and Descartes ascribe the cause of reality to vibrations of the aether.

Superphysics interprets such vibrations as waves and is why Superphysics is technically [a wave-based science](/social/economics/principles/intro/chapter-01/), notated by [qualimath](/superphysics/principles/chapter-07) in order to realize shiny new spacetime and aethereal technologies. 

Newton explained that the vibrational Spirit operates on both gravity and impulses in the brain. This is why Superphysics has Material Superphysics for gravitational vibrations, and Bio Superphysics for 'brain vibrations' (soul vibrations). 

We also have Social Superphysics for social vibrations such as the ones that trigger economic, political, and social actions. We even test vibrations on plants, as part of Agricultural Supereconomics, by trying out different sounds to increase crop yield. 

We were able to unite Newton and Descartes because we went outside the box of Western Science and tapped what the Asian Sciences of Hinduism, Taoism, and the Ancient Greek had discovered much earlier.

We were able to look into all of what Western science and Asian science had written down because the internet was invented and it allowed such information to be available to all.




<!-- The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has released images that show the most distant galaxies being "[brighter and more active than expected, with star-formation rates comparable to the one-star-per-year rate of the Milky Way today.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/jwsts-puzzling-early-galaxies-dont-break-cosmology-but-they-do-bend-astrophysics/)"
   
But instead of **debunking the Big Bang**, physicists propose absurd assumptions that star-formation was faster in the early universe, specifically through more black holes.

But then those black holes are [based on singularities which don't exist](https://www.space.com/what-happens-black-hole-center).   

It's like sweeping the ignorance-of-Nature dirt under the black-hole rug just to say "There's no mess here!".  

It reminds me of the geocentric theory of Aristotle wherein discrepancies were solved by adding more and more absurd [celestial spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_spheres) around the Earth, to the point that the original 27 Spheres ballooned to 72. 

In the end, the whole Spheres theory was replaced with a more common sense heliocentric theory of orbits.

I assume that physicists do not reject the Big Bang, even if JWST is screaming it to their faces, is because it's their best theory and they **feel** that it is better to have a wrong theory than to have no theory at all.

Instead of adding more weirdness to Lambda CDM, the most common sense solution that matches both modern and ancient data is to go back to the original **5 Elements model** used by the ancient Greeks, Hindus, Chinese, and advanced by Rene Descartes.

For example, in [Dioptrique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptrique), Rene Descartes separates the color-information from [the medium of light that transports it](https://www.superphysics.org/research/descartes/optics/part-01/). 

This means that [the speed of the data from those distant galaxies is different from the speed of light](https://www.superphysics.org/material/fallacies/big-bang/).  

It follows that those distant galaxies are at **the same age** as current galaxies and so there is no need to change the physics of star-formation.
   
So with that problem solved, then I assume that physicists do not reject the Big Bang, even if JWST is screaming it to their faces, is because its their best theory and it is better to have a wrong theory than to have no theory at all.  -->
