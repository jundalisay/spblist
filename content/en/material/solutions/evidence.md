Cartesian Physics explains how the universe works using the 5 Elements, the same mechanism used by the Asian sciences of Hindiusm, Buddhism, and Taoism.

This is different from Newtonian Physics which only explains the Material ELement, and Einstein who only explained the Fire Element (Radiant).  


In fact, all known phenomena, from plantary orbits to semiconductors to particle collisions fit very well with our modified version of Cartesian Physics made to fit the Asian sciences*. 

{{< n n="We did some minor tweaks to add the 4th Element and equate chakras to living vortices to fully match Cartesian animal spirits to chi and Buddhist levitation">}}  



Here we show the tests and phenomena that are still mysterious or unknown to Modern Physics, but explained fully by Cartesian Physics and the Asian Sciences, divided into the 5 Layers.

 <!-- and 5 Strata -->


### Material Layer (Earth Element)

Phenomena | Cartesian Principle
--- | ---
Boiled water freezes faster | The curved particles already evaporated 
Boiling at High Temperatures | 


### Convertible Layer (Water Element)

Phenomena | Cartesian Principle
--- | ---
Neutrinos are detected by liquids | Neutrons in liquids are part of the Convertible layer



### Radiant layer (Fire Element)

Phenomena | Cartesian Principle or Test
--- | ---
Freezing of light by salt atoms | Salt particles are crystals which can slow down photons through channels
Faster Cooling with Gravity |  We tested this with running watter 
Faster Fire Starting with compression |  We tested this with hammered wood (the same principle as diesel engines)
Fire suppression by sound | The addition of space particles defeats the heat particles (This is the same mechanism to halt nuclear chain reactions)

Todo: 
- Warm superconductors
- Glass based circuits


### Spatial layer (Air Element)

Phenomena | Cartesian Principle or Test
--- | ---
Chinese medicine during Covid | This leads to Bio Superphysics
Einstein Debunked (All Relativity-based theories fail) | Time is mental, not light-based 
Bob Lazar's Gravity-A Waves / Drone sightings in the US | Aetherspace can repel space particles

Todo:
- Condensation by the aether



### Aethereal layer (Aether Element)

Phenomena | Cartesian Principle or Test
--- | ---
Making 1 kg mass lighter by 2 grams | Particle-shaking through the aether
Levitating Buddhist Monk | Aetherspace can repel space particles 
James Webb Space Telescope Finding Very Distant Large Galaxies | Aether is instant through light
Plant growth through the aether | This leads to Bio Superphysics
Homeopathic cures | This leads to Bio Superphysics
