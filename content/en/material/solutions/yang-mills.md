Yang Mills is a generalization of Maxwell's electromagnetism to include matrices in order to describe the strong and weak nuclear forces.

It is the basis of the standard model which we are replacing with our 5 Elements MSQ model.

In Cartesian Physics, every energy packet is a vortex which has 2 directions:

1. Clockwise
2. Anticlockwise

This duality leads to symmetry and asymmetry. These packets take 5 forms as the 5 Elements or Fundamental Forces. 

Yang Mills uses a gauge group `G` for each Fundamental Force whereas Descartes simply splits them up into 5 Elements.

- In Spacetime, (Element 2 in Cartesian Physics), the duality manifests as clockwise, counterclockwise black holes. 
- In Electromagnetism (Element 1 in Cartesian Physics), this manifests as spin. 
- In the Weak force (Element 4 in Cartesian Physics), this symmetry manifests as Chiral symmetry.
- In the Strong force (Element 3 in Cartesian Physics), this manifests as matter-antimatter.

Empty space has energy from the pure aether (Element 0 in Cartesian Physics). This solves the mass gap. 

In layman speak: "The duality (Yang Mills) in each of the 5 Elements (Gauge Group) exists as properties of vortices (field fluctuations) which are ultimately aethereal in nature."

The big problem is that Newton rejected the aethereal vortices and replced them with simplistic mass. And so Physics has no scope for the answer because the blind are leading the blind.


### The Mass Gap

The mass gap explains why the Strong Force acts only at small distances. It exists because Physicists wrongly bunch up mass as a single concept when in fact they are different. 

The inertial-Newtonian-strong-force-mass is totally different from relativistic-Einstein-electromagnetic-mass.

The latter should be really called electromagnetic potential as an inherent property of Electromagnetism (Element 1 in Cartesian Physics). 

The nature-based difference between `mass` and `potential` leads to a mass gap. 

That gap is really facilitated by the aether (Element 0 in Cartesian Physics) through spacetime (Element 2). This is why quarks and antiquarks emerge from spacetime and must be in groups. 

Making a Quantum Field Theory for each Element would be as absurd as removing the differences between the 5 Elements just to make the whole thing notatable or mathematical.
