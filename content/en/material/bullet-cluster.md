In the 1640's, Descartes explained Gravitational Lensing as the refraction of starlight. 

However, unlike the gravitation of Newton or the lensing of Einstein which are based on mass, it is based on the 2nd Element as invisible spacetime particles.  

This is nowadays proven by the bullet cluster. In it, 2 old galaxies collided, leaving behind their mass while the spacetime body moves forward.

The lensing happens mostly through the 2nd Element spacetime body.

Cartesian Physics predicts that the mass of each galaxy will follow its spacetime body since matter is a slave to spacetime. Matter needs spacetime, but spacetime does not need matter. 

We show this as a galaxy-to-matter band which says that matter can never escape its galaxy. This is what the computer simulation shows:
