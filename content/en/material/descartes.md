Material Superphysics is largely based on Descartes *Principia Philosophia* which rivals the work of Newton. For example:
- [La Dioptrique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptrique) is the counterpart of Newton's Principia
- [Traité du monde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_(book)) is the counterpart of Newton's System of the World. 

Einstein's 'successful' predictive theories were already explained in the 1630's by Descartes:

Theory | Cartesian Version
--- | ---
Photoelectric effect | This was explained in Dioptrique. It happens when different colored light (like UV) hits a medium. The main difference between us and Descartes is that he puts particle spin as a property of the Electromagnetism (1st Element). But we assign it to the Weak Interaction (4th Element). https://www.suerphysics.org/research/descartes/optics/part-01b/
Microlensing | Explained in the World. It happens because spacetime has liquid properties and microlensing is like a halo or rainbow. https://www.superphysics.org/research/descartes/world/chapter-15/
Gravitational waves | This is explained by the liquid properties of spacetime and is not a fabric.
Special Relativity | This is mentioned in Cartesian Relationality for the 1st Element or Electromagnetism
General Relativity | This is Cartesian Relationality for the 2nd Element or Spacetime. Unlike Einstein's Relativity which makes Electromagnetism the supreme principle, Cartesian Relationality uses the aether. That is why James Webb Space Telescope and DESI debunk Big Bang and General Relativity but not Cartesian Relationality. 


In addition, Descartes describes the phenomena observed by current Physics:


## Quantum Mechanics

In Meditations, Descartes correctly says that reality is not real. In Traité du monde, he explains that the aether travels instantly. We combine these to make a roadmap for teleportation tech and make masses travel faster than light (which is impossible to Newton or Einstein).

{{< q a="Descartes" c="Method, Part 5" >}}
I explained how in an instant of time, light traverses the immense spaces of the heavens.

## Relativity

Relativity is baked into Descartes' Rules 1 and 2 of Motion. Newton does not have relativity in his laws because he assumed a static material universe.    


{{< q a="Descartes" c="Principia, Part 2, Article 13 " >}}
As we look to different bodies, we see that the original body at the same time changes its place, from one perspective, does not change its place, from another perspective.

## Gravity

Unlike Newton who professed that he did not know the origin of gravity, Descartes explains it as coming from spacetime particles which he called the aethereal air, which we call qosts.

Descartes' gravity is consistent with Kepler's gravity as invisible chains or slings. Superphysics calls it *bands* so that `w = mg` becomes `w = mb`, or `E :: Gb` in qualimath.

Instead of focusing on mass, the focus is on the elasticity of the band which has relativity baked in. This negates any need for Einstein. This will allow things to travel faster than `c` again, as intended by Nature. 

We can say that The Elastic Theory is the liberation of Physics from the dark ages of Einstein.


{{< q a="Descartes" c="Principia, Part 4, Article 20" >}}
The motion of the air-aether that makes droplets round also makes planets round. This phenomenon is the gravity of terrestrial bodies.
{{< /q >}}


## Electromagnetism

Descartes' was one of the first to draw a magentic field. His focus was light and not electricity because light is the subtler part of electromagnetism (in the upper layer). Electricity is the cruder part (in the lower layer). 

This is why we advcoate light-based computing over electron-based computing.

{{< q a="Descartes" c="Principia, Part 4, Article 170" >}}
Hence, there must always be a slight gap between the magnet and the iron to allow the striated particles to pass from one set of grooves to the other.

## Black Holes

Descartes called them air-aether which spin as vortices. He explained how the vortices create light, and how lensing works through them.

The swirl of a Cartesian vortex (black hole) was recently proven by Sagitarrius A and Messier 87. To Cartesian physics, a Newtonian singularity that violates physics is absurd and not needed because vortices already work fine.   


{{< q a="Descartes" c="The World, Chapter 8" >}}
We have assumed that the spaces `E` and `S` and all the small angles between the air-aether are empty.
