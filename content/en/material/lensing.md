The phenomenon of gravitational lensing is the change in the apparent position of a star by the meddling of another star or a galaxy. 

This is currently credited to Einstein through his General Relativity Theory in 1919.

Unknown to many, Descartes had already described gravitational lensing as "refractios de rayons" way back in 1633.

Unlike General Relativity which bases the cause to spacetime being warped by stellar or gravitational mass, Descartes' refraction is caused by the gravitational territory of the star or galaxy, and the position of its observer. 

<!-- and the star of that heliosphere (which he calls 'surfaces'). -->

In Cartesian Physics, all stars and galaxies have a 3D area-of-influence in the universal ocean which not only refracts light, but also changes its speed. 

This 3D area has recently been proven by the IBEX satellite which mapped the sun's heliosphere.

Descartes gives 3 kinds of gravitational territories: 

1. Material or based on earth-aether

Newton's `G` and inverse square law only works on material gravitational territories via matter. 

2. Stellar or based on fire-aether

Einstein's `c` and gravitational lensing only works on stellar gravitational territories via stars (since galaxies don't give off light). 

3. Galactic or based on air-aether

Hubble's constant and cosmological lensing only works on galactic gravitational territory via 'supermassive blackholes'.


Stellar gravitational territories combine to form a single unit within a galaxy's gravitational territory.
- This removes the need for dark matter to explain the constant speed of the galaxy rotation curve. 

Galactic gravitational territories also combine to form a single unit within its cluster. 
- This removes the need for dark energy to explain the expansion of the universe.

This cluster is based on the deployment of the aether which manifests as baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO). This is because sound is a property of the aether.   

Since dark matter and dark energy are no longer needed, then the expansion of the CMB and redshift can match, and 'early' galaxies can be large.
- This solves the 'crisis in cosmology' exposed by the James Webb Telescope.

To push for the existence of dark matter, physicists point to the Bullet Cluster which is the remnant of the collision of 2 groups of galaxies. 
- It shows the mass part being separated from the gravitational-lensing part. This is why they point to the gravitational-lensing part as proof of dark matter. 

But according to Cartesian Physics, the Bullet Cluster merely shows the disruption of the unity between stellar and galactic gravitational territories because of a collision. 

This is also proven by the 'trainwreck' cluster Abell 520, wherein dark matter cannot explain why the gravitational-lensing part is so far away from the mass parts.

Cartesian Physics explains that the lensing part is far because stellar gravitational territories are subservient or are slaves to their galactic vortex (supermassive black hole). This causes the stars and matter to follow or be dragged along by the moxing galaxy, as shown by the computer simulation for the Bullet Cluster:
