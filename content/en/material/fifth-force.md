Last month, scientists at Fermilab in the United States announced a potential fifth force of nature through their "Muon g-2 Experiment".

The experiment looked into the behavior of subatomic magnetic particles called muons. 


## What Does G-2 Mean?

<!-- In theory, the excess beyond 2 should be the same everywhere, just as the speed of light should be the same everywhere.  -->

According to quantum mechanics of the 1930's, magnetic particles have a "gyromagnetic ratio" which is notated as "g". 
- This ratio is the magnetic strength of the particle compared to its spin. 

In theory, a muon should have a `g` of 2. However, when they measured it in 1948, it was revealed to be 2.00238.

Where did the 0.00238 come from?

This discrepancy led to the invention of Quantum Electrodynamics by Richard Feynman to account for the excess beyond 2, among others.

From 2006, and in 2021, scientists in the US measured the muon's `g` again, and then compared the results with those predicted by both:
- Quantum Electrodynamics
- Quantum Chromodynamics. 

They found the difference to be smaller, with the measured value being different from the theoretical prediction from 9 decimal places.

Such a small difference could not be explained by current quantum electromagnetic theories. And so scientists postulated a new, "Fifth Force" to explain it. 

According to Fermilab, that Fifth Force must have the following properties:
- It has a lower mass than protons
- It must not interact with electrons
- It only interacts weakly with muons


## The Fifth Force as the Aetherspace Most2
<!-- Qost3 -->

According to those requirements, the "Fifth Force" is the spacetime quantum particles which we call Most2. These make up "empty" space.

Technically, they fill in the gaps created by spacetime particles.
<!-- , called most3 and most2 respectively.  -->

These interact with muons (qor2) and increase their magnetic moment by increasing the size of their hole. This increased hole allows more virtual photons to pass through, increasing the muon's magentism. 
<!-- going inside their hole. 

, but not smaller electrons (qor1)  -->

They cannot do so with electrons which are already too small. 
 <!-- because they are cruder just like the muons.  -->

<!-- These massless kinetic particles add "power" to the muons which translates to them having more mass. -->


<!--  is none other than the Aether -- an invisible, massless, wave-like material that permeates all of space.

The aether was first explained in detail in Plato's Timaeus where it was described to be a sort of invisible air. In Asia, it is called akasha in Hinduism, and æ°´ in Taoism. 

Modern aether theory began with philosopher Rene Descartes who researched the works of the ancient Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle. He described the dynamics of the aether in his work "The World", and was later formalized in his "Principia Philosophia".

In The World, Descartes describes the aether as being different from both electromagnetism and matter. His description matches the properties required by Fermilab.  -->

The Muon g-2 experiment is a very welcome development for those who are pushing for a new system of Physics that is not based on Newtonian matter or Einstein's speed of light.  


<!-- The results of the experiment suggest the possibility of a fifth force of nature, and scientists are getting closer to confirming its existence[1]. The experiments at Fermilab are not the only ones suggesting the presence of a fifth force, as similar tantalizing findings have also been observed in work conducted at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)[2]. The wobbling muon experiment, in particular, is expected to shed light on this potential new force[3].

Further research and analysis are required to fully understand the implications and significance of these findings. The discovery of a fifth force of nature would have profound implications for our understanding of the fundamental forces governing the universe.

<!-- Muons are particles that are closer to the aether than to electromagnetism this is why they travel nearly the speed of light and decay very quickly in the presence of matter. 

Since they are electromagnetic, they have inherent magnetism. In theory, this magnetism should be the same everywhere, just like the speed of light is the same everywhere. 

However, to their shock, the magnetism of the muon is not the same. 

This is why they speculate that a Fifth Force is causing the anomaly. 

This Fifth Force is unknown to Newtonian Physics, but is very known to Cartesian Physics, which calls it the aether. 

It says that the muon magnetism is different depending on its location, since the aether is above spacetime and spacetime is above electromagnetism. 

The aether not only expalins muon magnetism, but also dark matter, dark energy, Lorentz transformations, and a lot of other things. 

It is not a new discovery, being known already to the ancient Greeks via Timaeus, to the Hindus as akasha, and the Chinese in Chinese medicine.
