In 1644, Descartes established a complete theory of gravity, saying that objects revolve around the sun at varying speeds based on their location or distance from the center vortex, represented by the sun. 

The closest planets like Mercury revolved fast.

The outer planets like Jupiter revolved slower.

But the farthest objects revolved the fastest.

Each vortex is different from each other and so everything is relative depending on which vortex you use as the basis for measurement.  

Newton debunks this in his Principia in 1685, saying that planets revolve according to their inertia and not their location. 

This was validated when the outer planets were discovered. And so Descartes' theory was abandoned forever. 

But in 1933, Fritz Zwicky found that the outer parts of galaxies revolve faster than the inner parts, violating Newton. This led to the invention of dark matter to keep it within Newton's laws. 

But this really vindicated Descartes' gravity -- a supermassive blackhole is the best representation of a Cartesian vortex. 

The speed of the outer parts is accounted for by the center of the vortex and not by any dark matter. 

To put icing on the gravity-cake, the DESI telescopes, meant to measure dark energy, see that speed of the universe's expansion measured through red-shift varies depending on which galaxy-cluster you look.

And so in Cartesian Physics, there is no need for either dark matter or dark energy. 

Dark matter is an effect of the central vortex. 

Dark energy is an effect of clusters of vortices relative to each other.
