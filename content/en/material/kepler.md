Last December 27, I came up with a draft theory of gravitational relativity* derived entirely from Kepler's laws. 

{{< n n="Update August 2024: This eventually became the Elastic Theory of Gravity" >}}

His three laws of planetary motion were based on his Mysterium Cosmographicum which used "celestial harmonies". 

He called gravity as "kinships" and gravitational systems (solar system, galaxies, clusters) as "marriages" of "spheres" which have similarities to Schwarzchild radii.

### Kepler's Laws

1. **Elliptical orbits** 

> The orbit of a planet around the sun is an ellipse with the sun at one focus

2. **The area within the elliptical orbit**

> A line joining a planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal time

3. **The ratio of speed to distance**

> The square of a sidereal period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit.

Nobody could understand his celestial harmonies and so no one realized that they actually had the principles of both special and general relativity.

He explained that there were four kinds of gravity-kinships. Newton discovered one, Einstein discovered two as special and general relativity, and "dark matter" is the fourth. 

I realized that to understand Kepler, you first have to understand Pythagoras' musical theory which is its base.

To Pythagoras, numbers lead to tones and tones lead to harmonic attraction (manifesting as gravity or magnetism) or repulsion. The Pythagorean theorem (as a triangle) is then used to plot the resulting position after attraction or replusion.

Kepler's harmonies can easily account for Netwon's gravity and Einstein's relativity, and even adds two more sets of principles to explain the expansion of space and the start of the universe.  


## Who was Kepler?

Johanes Kepler was born 450 years and 7 days ago on December 27, 1571.

From Brahe's accurate observations he derived the three laws of planetary motion which were based on his theory of "celestial harmonies". 

Little did I know that Kepler was born on December 27, 1571. Can his 450th birthday also lead to a rebirth of his ideas?
