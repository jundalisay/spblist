Planck length is the smallest unit of space in the physical domain and is represented by a quantum of spacetime or qost. 


Superphysics: Science combined with Metaphysics. 

Superphysics is a New Science Based on Waves and the Dialectics of Socrates for Solving Problems

All Knowledge Can Be Grouped Into Three: Metaphysics, Superphysics, Physics.

Metaphysics is 1-50% Replicable. It is Paradoxical

Superphysics is 51-99% Replicable. It is Subjective

Physics is 100% Replicable. It is Objective.

The Nature of the Soul.

Everything is a wave that we see as a particle.

The universe is analog, but we see it as digital as Quanta. 


We're in a Matrix!

See how we can exist well in it
Everything is an Idea

Inside the Mind or Matrix
A New Math for a New Science

Has relativity baked in
Socratic Dialectics for Solving Problems

Do you have a problem? The solution already exists!
The Soul of the Physical Universe
Material Superphysics

Based on Descartes and the five layers of the ancient Greek, Hindus, and Chinese

The Five Layers of Superphysics

The Material, Convertible, Radiant, Spatial, and Aethereal
The Alternative to General Relativity

Relativity only works for Electromagnetic particles, not for all moving things. We fix it with the 5 Elements or Layers
The Medium-Substance-Quantum Naming Convention

Are you confused with hadrons, baryons, fermions, leptons, etc? We propose a simpler naming convention
The Fusion Solution

We propose anti-gravity through Cartesian spacetime vortices, as done by levitating monks through chakras
The Soul of Living Entities
Bio Superphysics

Based on the dynamics of the sentient energy

The Waves in the Economy
Supereconomics

A sub-science of Social Superphysics, since Economics comes after Politics

The Invisible Hand of Human Dharma

Fellow-Feeling Replaces Selfish-Interest as the foundation of the Economy just as The Theory of Moral Sentiments is the Basis of the Wealth of Nations
The Metaphysics of Value and the Four Laws of Value

We systematize all Economics concepts neatly under the Four Laws which mirror the Four Laws of Thermodynamics
NDP as an alternative to GDP

See how finance-less Net Domestic Product creates a more accurate picture of an economy than GDP
Maximized Productivity, Not Maximized Profits

See how barter credits maximize productivity and replaces balance sheet entries
Results of Tests of Superphysics Principles
Evidence

We test the principles of Superphysics (Asian Sciences, Alternative Medicine, Adam Smith, Physiocrats, Rene Descartes, alien, etc.), both Qualitative and Quantitative, to solve our own problems

Material Superphysics: Prelevitation

We reduced the weight of a mass by 0.001-0.006% without contact using the Cartesian aether (2020 and 2023)
Material Superphysics: Top-Down Fire

We enrich wood by hammering and use the top-down way to light fires for cooking food (2024). This is the simplest caveman-level technology that we can extract from Cartesian Physics.
Material Superphysics: Fire Suppression by Sound

Recent experiments prove that sound can suppress fire. This proves the reality of Cartesian combustion principles as opposed to Newtonian kinetic ones (2024).
Material Superphysics: James Webb Telescope Findings

The fidings of the James Webb Space Telescope (2022) support the no-Big-Bang-Theory of Rene Descartes
Bio-Superphysics: Virgin Coconut Oil Against Covid

We successfully used Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) against Covid (2020). VCO was later proven by DOST-FNRI to scientifically diminish symptoms of Covid
Bio-Superphysics: Chinese Medicine to get Pregnant

We successfully used Chinese Medicine to get Pregnant (2013)
Bio-Superphysics: Homeopathy Against Tooth Decay

We successfully used Homeopathy against Tooth Decay (2023). Disclaimer: Unlike other alternative medicine, Homeopathy only works if you believe in it. Whether it works or not totally depends on you.
Bio Superphysics: Athereal Plant Growth

We harvested Brassica Rapa Chinesis in 30 days instead of 40 using the aether. Very useful against food inflation (2023)
Bio Superphysics: Naturopathy Against Cancer

We successfully used Naturopathy against Stage 2 Breast Cancer (2014)
Social Superphysics: Moneyless System

We have used a moneyless system for our Pantrypoints startup since 2017 and is how we currently sustain Superphysics. It is based on aethereal trust instead of material money and is meant for the Crisis Years.
Social Superphysics: The Crisis Years

We correctly predicted 2020 as the start of the crisis years filled with economic crises and war, as an effect of the Negative Force and Social Cycles, just as the Seven Years War and WWI and WWII had them.
Social Superphysics: Predictions

Over 70% of our predictions, based on Socrates' Social Cycles, have come true (2015-2022)
Superphysics: True Love

One of our members used aethereal techniques to find true love (2017)
Superphysics: Personal Samadhi

Testing began in 2004 by dropping Christianity and adopting Asian Spirituality. Samadhi was achieved in 2008, leading to the precursor of Superphysics in 2012
Superphysics: Winning Prizes

We used aether techniques to win prizes in raffles and hackathons (2016-2022). One of our supporters used the technique to win in simple games like roulette and baccarat. None of us had the dharma (as focused aethereal energy) to win the lotto yet.
Proposed Solutions and Technology

We propose to implement the principles of Superphysics to solve modern problems

Material Superphysics: Solutions to Millennium Prize Problems

We will use Qualimath and the Physics of Rene Descartes on all Millennium Prize Problems (2030)

Unite the World with Common Morals and Systems
National Advocacies

We advocate the following based on Social Superphysics and Social Cycles to fix problems created by the Negative Force, using the Positive Force to Unite, De-materialize, and De-calcify countries

Republican USA with 4 Parties

A less democractic USA with Labor, Nationalist, Conservative, and Liberal Parties that have morals defined
China-Taiwan: One State, Federalized Systems

China transitions into a Federal Republic to allow many systems, similar to the USA
Vietnam, China: Splitting the Communist Party into Four

Remove Materialist philosophy and create a natural internal opposition of Labor, Nationalist, Conservative, and Liberal sub-parties. The Communist Party is then renamed as Republican Party
Moneyless Eurozone

Implement Moneyless version of EF Schumacher's Pool Clearing to make Greek-style Debt Crises obsolete
Russia-Ukraine: Rus Unification

Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus are united as a federal state with Kiev as the capital. This undoes Kiev's mistake during the Mongol conquest
Malaysia-Singapore: Reunification

Reunification as a secular federal state without Bumi policies.
India-Pakistan: Reunification

A secular state that undoes the partition mistake by the British
Afghanistan: A Female Guardian

Establish a Female Protector of Afghanistan (as a Socratic Guardian) which has veto over the President and is tasked to secure civil laws
