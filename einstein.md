THERE IS ALWAYS RELATIONALITY FROM THE 2 FORCES. EVEN THOUGHT EXPERIEMTNS HAVE THE 2 FORCES. HAVING NO 2 FORCES, ONLY 5 ELEMENTS WOULD LEAD TO BLANK

The wealth created by Economics only goes to a few people, as inequality. This is because money, as a static thing, can only bring liquidity to some parts of the economy and not all.  

For example, if you want to hire someone, you must have money at hand to pay him. If you don't, then the opportunity slips away for both of you. There are tons of opportunities missed by economic systems because of the limitations created by money.

Yes. But that adds to the cost. Our solution is to split the tool of trade from the store of value. 


This makes it cheaper to run. In fact, we have been running our system since 2017 without money-funding. We call these as barter-credits.

It eliminates the time-value of money. 


 Our cards and apps are the tool

The first step in fixing the theory of Relativity, is to recall that the Standard Model of Physics divides all forces into four categories which we arrange in a hierarchy:   


Material objects are made possible by atoms which are held together by the Strong force. The movement of such objects is governed by the classical mechanics established by Netwon, such as `F = ma` and the law of conservation of mass. This means that you can force-push a ball-mass to move it.

The movements by the Weak and Electromagnetic forces, such as those in radioactive decay and magnetism, were observed later. These were established by Maxwell's equations and the law of conservation of energy. 

Unlike matter, you cannot force-push electricity to make it travel farther. Instead, you use a capacitor to gather the electricity in coils and add strength and let it "flow" more.

The difference between the movements of matter and electromagnetism was then thought to be caused by a mysterious semi-material thing called "aether" which permeated space. This idea came from Huygens who got it from Descartes.






Einstein's ego led him to become a determinist who disliked* the unpredictability of Nature. This unpredictability manifests as "quantum nonlocality" in Quantum Mechanics. 

The mystery of the aether irked him just as the idea of a superior, immaterial God irks materialists. 


{{< n n="*This is evident in the [EPR Paradox](/research/einstein/epr/part-1)" >}}



{{< q a="Einstein" c="Ether and General Relativity" >}}
But why must I distinguish the non-moving `K` body above all moving `K'` bodies by assuming that the ether is at rest relatively to the non-moving `K` body?  I think that such an asymmetry.. is intolerable.
{{< /q >}}


To get rid of the aether, he used light as the semi-material thing to "bridge" the behavior of objects and electricity. This is because he realized that light has 2 properties:

1. Particle-properties, as photons
2. Wave-properties, as spectrum waves 

He called this unification as "special relativity" leading to mass-energy equivalence `E = mc{{< s v="2" >}}`.


{{< q a="Einstein" c="Relativity" >}}
<p>mc{{< s v="2" >}} does not contain the velocity. It is not needed if we are only asking how the energy of a point-mass depends on the velocity... Before the advent of relativity, physics recognised two conservation laws of fundamental importance, namely, the law of the conservation of energy and the law of the conservation of mass.. Through the theory of relativity, they have been united into one law.</p>

{{< img src="/photos/medieval/hitler.jpg" alt="Hitler" cap="Einstein found the Aether intolerable, just as Hitler found the Jews intolerable. Both lived at the same bigoted period in Germany. Einstein wanted Nature to follow one Law just as Hitler wanted the world to follow one Aryan race." >}}


{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/emc.png" alt="E=mc2" cap="Thanks to the egotistic Einstein, the aether is out of reach, and with it the solution to fusion, anti-gravity, and nuclear war. The fact that Einstein pushed for nukes is consistent with such a type of ego" >}}



### Not so fast, Einstein!

Instead of using a natural immaterial aether (substance 1) that confined materials (substance 2), Einstein used light which had 2 properties. 

<!-- 1. A property of an immaterial (massless) wave-substance
2. A property of a material (mass-ive) particle-substance
 -->

He destroyed the natural division of labor of Nature in favor of a single monopoly under the power of the physicist.


{{< img src="/graphics/physics/msq.jpg" alt="MSQ" cap="Superphysics respects the division of labor of the 5 Layers or Elements which we call Aether, Spacetime, Radiance, Conversion, and Matter" >}}

He then extended this theory, as General Relativity, to the movement of objects in outer space which was really governed by the aethereal force of Gravitation. 

Einstein thus removed the aether and its hierarchy, replacing it with the duality of light. Because of this, gravity no longer is a force. Instead, it is an effect of the curvature of space, exposed by light. 

Without the aether, a lot of problems came up. 

General Relativity:
- theorizes wormholes without them ever being found
- is unable to:
  - explain dark matter and dark energy
  - explain the Hubble Tension
  - create anti-gravity or teleportation of masses

Special Relativity:
- is unable to explain the discrepancy between
  - the W Boson mass
  - muon g2 discrepancy
- actually failed to explain entanglement with its hidden variables theory

<!-- Material Superphysics solves all these with the properties of the aether and Cartesian spacetime. 

Problem | Solution

W Boson Mass, Muon G2 | Aether and Poincare Spacetime -->


<!-- While his Special Relativity is bullet-proof*, his General Relativity is full of holes. 

> *It's bullet-proof because Lorentz-Maxwell, its base, was already bullet-proof. Those theories had the aether as their base. 


For example, wormholes and dark matter have never been found. In fact, the photo of an actual black hole (Messier 87) shows light being ejected as a flare-helix instead of being emitted gently as Hawking radiation nor disappearing into the blackhole (as a wormhole) into another spacetime*. -->

<!--
Physicists try to defend by saying that the flare obeys General Relativity. 

We say: "Sure, but what mechanism causes the flares to happen in the first place? General Relativity has nothing on helix behavior in empty space. But we explain it clearly as **aethereal vortices**." 

 This led to the ideas of [gravitational waves](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/10/what-are-gravitational-waves-ligo-astronomy-science/), worm holes, and [dark matter*](https://dailygalaxy.com/2021/04/emergent-gravity-dark-matter-is-a-mythical-beast-a-figment-of-our-ignorance-watch-todays-galaxy-stre) -->

<!-- > *A true theory of gravity should be able to explain dark matter and dark energy conclusively. General Relativity has nothing on both and is therefore not a theory of gravity. To Superphysics, it is not even an incomplete theory of gravity, but rather a theory of electromagnetism (as Special Relativity) applied to outerspace where it happens to be affected by gravity. -->


<!-- Many physicists have been wasting real money building dark matter detectors, money that could've been used for space travel or even better Covid vaccines.  -->


<!-- {{< img src="/photos/physics/messier87.jpg" alt="Black Hole" cap="A quasar-black hole behaves differently from what General Relativity predicts. " >}}

Our disdain and even hatred for General Relativity, as something that goes against how Nature works, is supported by Nikola Tesla who instead supported the aether. -->


## Probably a German Quirk

Einstein's sophistical reasonng is very similar to that of Kant. Both of them overexplain a simple thing and then create a totally new concepts to support that overexplanation. 

<!-- How could Einstein end up with such mistakes? 

### Shallow Humans Fall Into the Trap

Here, we tap Socratic dialectics to troubleshoot Einstein's understanding.  -->

In contrast, Socrates explains that the universe is intuitive and not-so-complex. His principle states that in observing the heavens:
- there should be no constant
- light should not be used to build the core principle 

Socrates says that future astronomers would likely violate these maxims due to a predisposition towards mathematics*. That's exactly what happened to Einstein**. 

{{< n n="*This is why we invented Qualimath" >}}


  
<!-- > **We can even work backwards and see the same mistakes from Newton, Ptolemy, and Aristotle who went with the obvious, instead of digging deeper into the metaphysical or noumenal causes. A clear example is Hubble's classification system for galaxies wherein Messier87 is an elliptical galaxy just because it doesn't have spirals. In our system, it is a quasar that has counterclockwise rotation. -->

This is evident in his 1905 paper:

{{< q a="Einstein-sophist" c="On The Electrodynamics Of Moving Bodies, 1905" >}}
a mathematical description of this kind has no physical meaning unless we are quite clear as to what we understand by “time”.. We have so far defined only an “A time” and a “B time.” We have not defined a common “time” for A and B, for the latter cannot be defined at all unless we establish by definition that the “time” required by light to travel from A to B equals the “time” it requires to travel from B to A.
{{< /q >}}

Einstein did it because his ego couldn't define time metaphysically. Instead, he covered it up a physical (mathematical) definition, inevitably leading to circular reasoning:

{{< q a="Einstein-sophist" c="Relativity, Section 8" >}}
Two lightning flashes occurred simultaneously at A and B seen by an observer at the middle. [We thus define time as simultaniety, and define simultaniety as light appearing at the same time.]  <i>It would thus appear that we are reasoning in a logical circle</i>.
{{< /q >}}

<!-- But we only demand that ‘simultaniety’ supply us with an empirical decision. -->

This is very different from other physicists who had egos that were subservient to Nature. This kept time subjective or metaphysical and never objective or physical:

{{< q a="poincare" c="The Measure of Time" >}}
We have not a direct intuition of simultaneity, nor of the equality of two durations.  If we think we have this intuition, <b>this is an illusion</b>
{{< /q >}}

Here, we expose Einstein's ego as the cause for the flaws of Relativity. In [this post](/material/fallacies/light-ruler), we will explain the actual implementation of that flaw, as the use of the speed of light to measure spacetime. 





## The Luminiferous Aether of Huygens

In the 19th century, nearly all physicists embraced the [luminiferous aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether) of Huygens as the medium that gave light its wave properties.

The belief that an aether wind was propelling light forward. This meant that perpendicular light beams would have different speeds -- one should be slower than the other. 


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/huygenschap1d.png" a="Huygens aether" c="The Huygens aether is actually the 2nd Element of Descartes or spacetime, different from the pure aether (what we call the 0th Element)" >}}

<!-- All that was needed was to get proof of the aether by measuring the changes in the speed of light in different times in a year. Such changes would then be evidence of an 'aether wind' that 'blew' light. 

This was done through an 'interferometer' as the Michelson-Morley experiment.

That experiment showed that the speed of light is the same everywhere, and so there was no aether wind.
 -->


And so in 1887, an [experiment was done by Albert Michelson and Edward Morley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment) using an interferometer to test exactly this. 

Two light beams were arranged perpendicularly, with one going along the Earth's motion. This made it go with the aether.

<!-- , making its speed different from the other. But  -->

However, the result showed that the speed of both light beams were the same. Therefore, the aether did not exist. 

More importantly, it showed that the speed of light was constant everywhere and in all directions. 
- Before this, it was thought that space was constant and light was changing. 
- After this, physicists realized that space was changing and light was constant.

This led to the idea of space-contraction and space-relativity. 


### The Cartesian Aether is not the Huygens Aether

Because of the negative result, the aether was discarded and has since been frowned upon. It was replaced by Einstein with a spacetime fabric that could bend the path of light as gravity-warp instead of a gravity-force.  

Unknown to physicists, **the Cartesian Aether is not the Huygens Aether**. The former is behind spacetime, while the latter is spacetime itself, as the Descartes' 2nd Element. 

The experiment by Michelson and Morley proved 2 things:

1. The 2nd ELement exists as spacetime
2. The pure aether exists as the discrepancy between Fizeau's light speed and that of Michelson-Morley
