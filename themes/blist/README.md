Historically, these geometries manifest as pyramids and pyramid blocks which must be precise as to fit perfectly like lego bricks. 

{{< img src="/photos/objects/egypt.jpg" alt="Egyptian pyramids" cap="The ancient Egyptians knew about the principles of the spatial layer and were consequently focused on geometry" >}}


## Shape is Very Important in the Spatial Layer 

In fusion, these geometries manifest as the different shapes of the fusion reactors which represent the different ways of confining material plasma, as explained [here](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-021-03401-w/index.html).

**1. The Donut Tokamak**

![Donut-shaped tokamak](/graphics/tokamak.jpg)

**2. The Twisty Stellarator**

![Stellarator reactor](/graphics/stellarator.jpg)

**3. The Spherical General Fusion Design**

![Spherical reactor](/graphics/gf.jpg)

**4. The Linear TAE**

![TAE reactor](/graphics/tae.jpg)


These four shapes can be categorized into two*:

1. Roundish fusion reactors (Reactors 1-3)
2. Linear fusion reactors (Reactor 4)

> *This is similar to how Social Superphysics distills the four political cycles of Liberal, Neoliberal, Conservative, and Neoconservative into two: Liberal versus Conservative


These are used by advanced alien civilizations as the basis of their UFO design:

1. Round reactors lead to spherical UFOs as flying saucers
2. Linear reactors lead to cigar shaped ones


{{< img src="/graphics/physics/ufo.png" alt="UFO shapes" cap="All UFOs are perfectly symmetrical with simple shapes because their propulsion comes from their center of gravity. Their Physics have long abandoned Newtonian Classical mechanics" >}}



{{< img src="/photos/physics/phoenix.jpg" alt="V-shaped UFO" cap="The large 'Phoenix' UFO uses two linear reactors shaped as a V, giving it much more power than a saucer or cigar UFO. This eliminates the need for 'wormholes' for going into the 'other side of the universe' or to 'other dimensions" >}}



It's clear that alien civilizations have figured out how to harness fusion. If the smallest ship is 7 meters in diameter then its round fusion reactor should be small enough to fit inside a bus, unlike the current reactor designs which occupy whole buildings.  


So what is missing in the human version?


## Artificial Gravitation is Missing 

The main problem is that physicists haven't discovered the underlying principles for gravitation. 


Currently, this is supposed to be done by Einstein's General Relativity (GR)*. However, upon closer inspection of [his theory](/material/fallacies/general-relativity), it's clear that GR is merely Special Relativity (SR) applied to cosmic objects. 


**It is a theory of light applied to outerspace. It is not a theory of gravity!**





The proof is the necessity of light to prove GR:

- gravitational waves are detected by LIGO which uses light-based lasers
- gravitational lensing is detected by light from other stars

> *The blame for the dominance of Einstein's GR really falls on Lorentz who was not able to properly defend the concept of the all-pervading aether (which now is called the Higgs field)  



The problem is that SR is based on the principles of electromagnetism, which is the lower layer under gravitation (spatial layer). This leads to absurd concepts like a singularity that defies physics. 

The predictions of GR are only true for whatever is **visible** in the universe. It doesn't apply to invisible things, such as dark matter, actual black holes, and the **relationships** between different cosmic objects. 

Take away light and Einstein's General Relativity fails! The problem is that the visible universe is a very very small part of physical reality. GR has no opinion on other dimensions or multiverses and so quantum physics messes around with quack theories like Penrose's CCC.

Hindu and Buddhist monks have figured out all the five layers of the universe and that's why they came up with a policy of  denouncing physical reality. 

Instead of immersing in the material world, they focus on the highest aethereal layer which is pure metaphysics. A side-effect of this is having *siddhas* or supernatural powers. They are only "supernatural" because the human definition of the "natural" world is the universe that lies in the 3 lower layers:

1. Electromagnetic (eletromagnetic force)
2. Transformative (weak force)
3. Material (strong force)




This shows how low energy input as metaphysical Effort*, without any physical fuel source or physical Force, can produce "work" as to physically lift a man by altering his [gravitational signature](/material/fallacies/general-relativity). 

> *This concept is one of the basis for our [Effort Theory of Value](/social/economics/principles/part-2/chapter-01b/), derived from Adam Smith, and is the foundation of Supereconomics. It is opposite of the 'scarcity' embraced by Economics which makes it into a dismal science. 


This is the same technique used by UFO's to lift themselves without needing boosters nor bulky fuel tanks. It implies that their ships are sentient* just as the monk is sentient or has his own ability to express metaphysical ideas and do effort by himself.

> *This is why artificial sentience is one of the main goals of Superphysics


<!-- This is the first power-generation method that we mentioned being simiar to windmills.   -->

Fusion is thus created when a sentient computer manipulates the gravitational signature of hydrogen, as deuterium, as to both confine and levitate them. This is the same thing that stars ([stellar qosts](/material/principles/part-2/chapter-03)) naturally do to clouds of gas and dust in a galaxy to start fusion and actually become stars*.


> *This implies that stars are sentient. This sentience is [the origin of life](/bio/solutions/covid-star) in the universe and is the connection point between Material and Bio Superphysics


This system does not need an external fuel source or large amounts of external energy, making it very long lasting and sustainable. In fact, stars use it to give free energy* for billions of years until it runs out of gas, literally. 

<!-- This can be applied to fusion as the alternate way to confine plasma as to create high energy output using very low energy input by using gravity to both levitate and confine the plasma which starts out  or hydorgen. --> 

<!-- , can be added to make this power-generation system output more energy to power entire civilizations.  -->

Magnetism plays a very negligible role in this type of fusion because if a UFO's reactor were mostly magnetized then it would be left behind whenever the UFO teleported to another location! 

<!-- In the gravitational method, the plasma itself creates the gravitational field by creating a vortex in the center. This is similar to a pyramid that uses its tip as the vortex for the Earth, like an antenna.  -->

<!--  which has caused a lot of problems in the world via Marxism and Communism. The goals of Marxism of freedom and justice are very good and noble, but its underlying metaphysics is totally junk. This leads to suffering instead of goodness.

Its rival Capitalism also embraces Aristotle, as proven by Ayn Rand and the subsequent  which also caused suffering.
 -->



## Mini FAQ

1. How are you so sure that magnetic fusion won't work eventually after it's scaled it up?

Because the principles of electromagnetism are the same for the small and large scale. It is the principles of gravitation that is affected by scale. A small qost that has a little data to output will have slightly different dynamics from a supermassive qost that has a lot of data to churn. 

An electron (qor) merely reflects the data that already exists. This is different from a qost that actually creates data which really comes from its underlying aether. 


2. Einstein already disproved the aether, right?

No. Einstein merely cited the experiment of Michelson and Morley which detected no **material** aether in space that was supposed to create aether-drag. But this is because they didn't know that the "Fire" aether is bound or limited by the spatial layer.

The proper way to "discover" the fire-aether is to measure the speed of light:
- at very "far" times at the same space (like our Earth) or
- at very "far" spaces (such as from Earth and from Alpha Centauri) at the same time . 

This leads to different measurements of the speed of light. These differences then represent the aether-drag. 

<!-- The "Earth aether" was later detected as the Higgs boson which proved the existence of a Higgs field that gave mass to particles. We equate the Higgs field as the Stokes Aether.  -->

<!-- In the sequence of creation in Superphysics, data starts in the aethereal layer. This then is coursed through the spatial layer through qosts which turn the data into physical reality through qosts (gravitons in Physics) which manifest as stars and other gravitational objects. These objects combine the preexisting energy with the data from the aether in order to create particles that have mass and emit the data as photons, sounds, tactility, etc.  -->

![Michelson](/graphics/physics/michelson.png)

<!-- Thus, aether cannot be measured by electromagnetism just as you cannot shine a physical light on ideas or souls to see them. 

Instead, it follows the dynamics described by Hinduism, Taoism, Timaeus, and Descartes.

- `E :: G{{< sub v="l" >}}` in the material layer manifests as `w = mg` and is discovered by high school and university-level Physics
  - `w` (weight) is inherent `E` (energy)
  - `m` (mass) is `G` 
  - `g` is the domain of Earth's gravity where the object lies 
- `E :: G{{< sub v="l" >}}` in the electromagnetic layer manifests as `E = mc{{< s v="2" >}}` and is discovered by graduate-level Physics. `G` becomes `m`, and `{{< sub v="l" >}}` becomes `c{{< s v="2" >}}` which represents the speed limit of Minkowski's four-dimensional space 
- `E :: G{{< sub v="l" >}}` in the gravitational layer manifests as `E = G{{< sub v="AB">}}` and will be discovered by research institutions, where `B` and `A` are locational properties within spacetime of the same `G`

Einstein admitted that his whole theory was a scam from the start, as circular reasoning. 

"Your definition would be right, if the light by means of which the observer at M perceives the lightning flashes travels along the length A -> M with the same velocity as along the length B -> M. But an examination of this supposition would only be possible if we already had at our disposal the means of measuring time. It would thus appear as though we were moving here in a logical circle. (On the Idea of Time)"

There is no need to rack your brain trying to disprove or expose a scam. 

There is no need to cite Veritasium either.

We have solved it by using Cartesian (Descartes') Physics which has Lorentz-Poincare Relativity instead of Einstein's scam Relativity.

The core of the problem is that Einstein used light (electromagnetism) to measure spacetime. The great big problem is that electromagnetism is INFERIOR to spacetime. So using light to measure space is to lock space and make it fixed and rigid. You will notice that they use atomic clocks to test Relativity and it always passes the test. 

This is like asking Trump supporters to judge Trump. Of course, they will always give Trump the highest marks. 

Einstein's Relativity is destroyed by using either material time or mental time. This is like asking a Democrat to judge Trump.

For example, use a sand clock in a fast airplane to measure material time relative to a stationary sand clock at the airport. 

Or have a person sleep in the fast airplane and wake him up upon touchdown and ask him how many hours he thinks he slept. Do it also for a guy sleeping in the airport.

How Artificial Intelligence Can Prevent Banking Crisis

Last week, Vietnam was rocked by the scandal between Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB) and property developer Van Thinh Phat group (VTP) wherein SCB lent $44 billion of its deposits to the group through Truong My Lan who gained ownership of SCB through dummies.

She bribed Central Bank officials to allow her illegal ploy. 

Banking crises and scandals are not new. Back in the 18th century, many banks collapsed due to speculation and imprudent practices. Adam Smith said that one of the best preventatives for such crises was to create strict rules. These rules are usually implemented by the government through the Central Bank.

The problem is that the Central Bank itself is made up of humans which are corruptible, as proven by the SCB scandal. 

To solve this, it would be better to implement the rules through artificial intelligence
